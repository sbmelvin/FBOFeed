<DESC>1. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) solicits manufacturers of a Survival Kit, Ready Access, Modular (SKRAM) Bag system for Army Aircrews.  The  Army will competitively procure and then field a Go Bag system (aka SKRAM) that is flame retardant and modular that aviators can mount in the aircraft and grab when in an escape and evasion scenario.  The two bag SKRAM system shall provide carriage for the minimum mandatory Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE), three liters of water in a hydration reservoir, and mission specific equipment for use as a rapid-access, tactical environment survival system when aircrews must dismount airframes. The ALSE carriage module SKRAM consists of a) two Go Bag modules (one for the minimum mandatory gear and one for mission specific gear); b) one Hydration Carrier; (optional) c) one Gear Insert, and d) two M-4 magazine pouches.  These components can be assembled into a single backpack, or stowed separately on the aircraft, for best stowage space advantage.  A Gear Insert is used for organization and carriage of the minimum mandatory ALSE.  The mission specific gear is arranged in the second Go Bag as the aircrew member desires. The Hydration Carrier accommodates a standard 100 ounce on-the-move hydration reservoir.  Included are quick release cargo straps for anchoring the SKRAM to various aircraft platforms.  These straps include a Double Loop Strap, Cargo Tie-Down Strap, and Shackle Strap. SKRAM manufacture must meet the requirement of the  Detail  Specification Item Specification for Survival Kit, Ready Access, Modular (SKRAM) Air Warrior Block 3; AVNS-DTL-10836.  In addition the AVNS-DTL-10836 requires the SKRAM to meet the Interface Control Drawings (ICD).  The SKRAM cannot exceed the physical limitations of the ICD due to the multi-configuration aircraft space restrictions.  The AVNS-DTL-10836 is a product performance specification and NO pattern drawings are available.   The M-4 magazine pouches, Double Loop Strap, Cargo Tie-Down Strap, and Shackle Strap are to be manufactured in accordance with a Technical Data Package that includes drawings for manufacture and Purchase Descriptions that delineate specific manufacturing and inspection criteria. These specifications will be provided with the subject solicitation.<BR><BR>2.  Air Warrior anticipates procuring up to 45,000 Go Bags, 30,000 Gear Inserts, 50,000 M-4 Magazine Pouches, 3,000 Hydration Carriers with approximately 6,000 Cargo Tie Down Straps, 21,000 Double Loop Straps, and 21,000 Shackle Straps, over a five year period in a range quantity, firm fixed priced, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR> <BR>3. With their proposals offerors will submit Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) for the Go Bag, DTL-10836-1, the Gear Insert DTL-1-836-12; and the Cargo Tie-Down Strap Part Number 1005978-3.  Specific requirements for flame retardant treatment, color, and spectral reflectance in accordance with the Technical Data Package will not be required for the PDMs. In addition, test data from specific tests for tensile loads will be required. The PDM samples will be evaluated for pass/fail criteria to the detail specification and technical data package, as applicable. Evaluation will include PDM samples test, schedule compliance, proposed item pricing reasonableness, pre-award survey results, as required, and responsiveness to the solicitation's other requirements, terms and conditions, including contractor responsibility. <BR><BR>4.  Potential offerors should plan to attend a Pre-Proposal Conference, to be scheduled for late January or early February 2010, in Huntsville, Alabama.  The exact date and location will be published in FedBizOpps after soliciation release and prior to the event.   <BR>

<SUBJECT>Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory (INTERMACS) Renewal 
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-HV-11-16

<CONTACT>Jeffrey A Williams, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0331, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquistions (OA), will be seeking proposals from qualified Offerors with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and capable of maintaining, managing, and augmenting the Interagency Registry in support of the INTERMACS program. Project Background The NHLBI is interested in renewing the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) program contract for a data coordinating center to manage a registry of advanced heart failure patients receiving FDA-approved, durable, mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs). INTERMACS is a national registry created to advance the understanding and application of mechanical circulatory support in order to improve the mortality, morbidity, and quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure. It is a collaboration among NHLBI, FDA, CMS, clinicians, scientists, and industry. To date there are 100 centers participating and over 2000 patients enrolled in the registry. As many as 600,000 patients in the US have advanced heart failure, and the numbers are growing. Therapeutic approaches have changed little over the last few years and include: drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and pacemakers. Patients whose heart failure progresses to later stages of heart failure have options limited to medical management, transplantation or mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy. INTERMACS data serve to facilitate the refinement of patient selections to enhance clinical management with current devices, and guide and expedite clinical trials for new indications and/or new devices. Purpose and Objectives The goal of the proposed program is to continue and expand data collection of advanced heart failure patients receiving mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD). This will provide detailed data on advanced heart failure patients treated with FDA-approved, durable MCSD devices throughout the United States. All patients receiving MCSDs at INTERMACS certified sites are entered into the registry database. Information on patient demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters, outcome measures, hospital and device performance, as well as blood and tissue samples are collected and stored. The program is supported by an INTERMACS Data Coordinating Center. Project Requirements 1. Implement a collaboration plan, such as but not limited to a Public, Private Partnership that integrates Industry and other non-NHLBI collaboration and financial support for the INTERMACS enterprise on an increasing scale so that at the end of five years the NHLBI financial contribution to maintain the registry would be significantly reduced. The plan should provide for: a. the maintenance of data quality and completeness, data access, and the rigor and objectivity of the database and registry policies and procedures. b. an external advisory board to advise on integration of Industry involvement in the Registry and long-term sustainability plans. 2. Maintain and manage the INTERMACS Registry by serving as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). This will require the following: a. Continue data collection on current INTERMACS patients at certified clinical sites until death or transplantation (whichever occurs first), and collect data on new patients receiving FDA-approved MCSDs at certified clinical centers. b. As part of the data collection activities described above in &ldquo;a,&rdquo; the DCC shall maintain a computer system and website and associated plans and documentation as described below: i. Develop and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the collection, storage, and analysis of all registry data (including biological specimens) collected from all clinical sites. Provide computer backup systems in the event of a primary system failure. Maintain documentation of the data variables, data ranges and assure appropriate confidentiality and security of all computer files. ii. Develop and maintain a registry web site for the distribution of INTERMACS information, documents, and forms to the clinical sites and investigators. Develop and maintain a secure web-based entry system for clinical sites to use. All web pages designed under this contract shall meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (<a href="http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#Back">http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#Back</a>) iii. Develop and execute plans and procedures to make data, associated data collection software, web site information, and associated documentation transportable for future government use. iv. Submit an Information Systems Security Plan as required by the NHLBI. c. As required under human subjects protection regulations, revise DCC regulatory documents including the registry protocol and Informed Consents to reflect "INTERMACS" as the recipient of Protected Health Information and obtain approval through the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Supply new IRB-approved regulatory documents to the participating clinical sites and oversee revision and submission of site regulatory packages through the site IRBs. Document this process and assure that all sites have complied and all Informed Consents contain the required Federal elements. After regulatory approvals are received, oversee the identification, contacting and reconsenting of existing INTERMACS patients and new enrolling patients. Assure all human subjects protections are followed during this process. The process should provide for minimal disruption of data collection in the Registry. (Note: all current [approximately 100] clinical sites name only the incumbent contractor and its subcontractor as the recipient of patient Protected Health Information in their Informed Consent documents) d. Maintain procedures to inform appropriate personnel at each participating hospital of the requirements for data collection, as outlined in the Registry protocol and Manual of Operations which can be found at www.intermacs.org e. Monitor hospitals to ensure the data are forwarded to the DCC in a timely manner f. Maintain data quality and reporting compliance by reviewing all clinical data transmitted by the participating hospitals to ensure completeness and quality control prior to processing g. Maintain liaison with each participating hospital to assist in the resolution of operational problems involving collecting and reporting data h. Expand and augment the collection of functional capacity, health status (e.g. quality of life), and neurocognitive assessments for patients entered in INTERMACS 3. Develop and implement a plan to resume collection and processing of blood and/or tissue specimens and their transfer to the NHLBI supported repository and utilization by the scientific community. The plan is to be developed in consultation with the NHLBI, the Focused Research Subcommittee of the Steering Committee, and other scientific experts as appropriate. The plan will be reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee. 4. Maintain and support the existing Operations, and Steering Committee structure and function including: representation from the NHLBI Program Office/Contract Officer's Technical Representative, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a study chair designated by the NHLBI, the Data Coordinating Center Principal Investigator, Co-investigators, and members from representative participating hospitals; and current and future Subcommittees and their activities. Support includes but is not limited to scheduling meetings, providing conference lines and meeting facilities, preparing meeting materials and distributing them, supporting a Registry website, having a meeting bulletin area on a password protected website, and preparing meeting minutes and reports. 5. Arrange conference calls for the Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB) to be held at least twice a year, provide summaries of the data analysis and specific patient data sets as requested by the NHLBI and OSMB members. Prepare and distribute minutes of the meetings. Provide OSMB summaries to clinical site PIs. 6. Maintain and support certification of new and existing hospitals and monitoring of hospital performance. The Offeror shall train staff of participating hospitals in Registry methods of data, blood and tissue collection such that eligible new hospitals can be certified to participate in the Registry. Develop an on-line, interactive INTERMACS training program for new hospitals and new staff, and a review program for coordinators and staff at certified sites. Institute effective remedial actions for hospitals failing to meet or maintain performance standards or eliminate hospitals unable to maintain standards, and identify and certify replacement hospitals in collaboration with the Hospital Training and Standards Subcommittee of the Steering Committee (SC). 7. Maintain and support regulatory requirements for patient privacy and good clinical practices. Facilitate new site IRB submissions and assure compliance of regulatory documents for all existing sites. Assure that all new site informed consents contain NIH required elements at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/assurance/consentckls.htm">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/assurance/consentckls.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/policies/tissue.htm">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/policies/tissue.htm</a>. 8. Develop and execute a plan for equitable reimbursement to hospitals for participation in INTERMACS for collection of health status (e.g. quality of life), functional capacity and neurocognitive data per the current protocol. 9. Provide statistical analyses and reporting of the data to established recipients including the Federal partners (FDA, CMS and NHLBI), collaborating sites, and collaborating investigators as approved by the Data Access, Analysis, and Publications Subcommittee of the SC. Reports are available at www.intermacs.org and formats for confidential reports are available upon request. 10. Prepare and distribute quarterly reports for participating hospitals to include patient recruitment in various categories, status of follow-up data, data compliance and other data as agreed between the sites and the DCC. 11. Provide both standard and specialized quarterly data reports to the Federal partners (FDA, CMS and NHLBI). 12. Provide quarterly individualized industry data reports to collaborating companies. 13.

<p>Project Description and Scope</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL</p>
<p>As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government's primary biomedical research agency. Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. Helping to lead the way towards medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives, the NIH scientist investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.</p>
<p>The world's largest clinical research hospital is a complex of buildings on the NIH campus, known Building 10 or the Clinical Center Complex (CCC). With the original Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center at the hub, over the years the complex expanded from its original 1951 structure to encompass important additions. The latest is the new Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, which includes 350 flexible patient bed modules that function as inpatient beds and day hospital stations; research laboratories; a Vivarium; animal surgery suite; offices; hospital support services; and radiation oncology.</p>
<p>Portions of the original Building 10 facility are no longer capable of supporting modern research. The infrastructure is undersized, exceeded its useful life and must be replaced with modern state-of-the-art equipment to provide sufficient and reliable support for research. With the completion and occupancy of the new Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, portions of the original Building 10 are now vacated in sufficient quantities to begin a phased renovation. <br /><br />1.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The proposed project is an incremental renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 (Floors 2-14) on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing and funding sources, the project is designed to be accomplished in phases.<br /><br />Phase A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14. Phase A also includes installation of mechanical equipment on the 14th floor and treatment tanks on Floor B-1 and related alterations/piping on Floors 1 and B-2.</p>
<p>Phase B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14. Phase B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Phase A.</p>
<p>1.2 PROJECT FUNDING AND TASK DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>There are two major funding sources for the renovation of the F Wing. Phase A will be constructed through normally appropriated funds and Phase B will be funded using ARRA funding authorities. It is important that strict accounting protocols be maintained to ensure that the proper funding source is used for each project element. For each project element, the CMc shall designate the appropriate funding source. The CMc contract will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). Phase A and Phase B will be completed through a series of Task Order awarded under the CMc IDIQ contract</p>
<p>1.2.1 Task 1 - Task 1 is a task under the IDIQ contract to be paid for by normally appropriated funds. The scope of Task 1 is the Phase A Pre-construction; Phase A Renovation of the F Wing as defined on the plans and specifications; Phase A Activation/Occupancy; Phase A Closeout. Task 1 shall be completed as a priority.</p>
<p>1.2.2 Task 2 - Task 2 - Task 2 is a task under the IDIQ contract to be financed by ARRA funding authorities. The scope of Task 2 is Phase B preconstruction; Phase B renovation of the F Wing as noted on the Plans and Specifications; Phase B Activation / Occupancy; and Phase B Project Closeout. Phase B will involve the renovation of approximately 150,000 GSF of former patient care and laboratory areas into modern state-of-the art labs, lab support space, and offices for clinical research programs. Also included in Phase B are supply/exhaust fan and mechanical equipment rooms on floors 9, 13, and 14; and vertical building and lab service distribution risers for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems not constructed during Phase A. Approximately 82,500 GSF, consisting of space on floors 2-13 south of the North Corridor (Corridor xF.1), will be immediately available for construction and can be renovated concurrently with Task 1. The balance of the spaces within Phase B will become available for renovation as follows: <br />&bull; Floors 6,7 North Corridor and spaces north of the North Corridor available Oct. 2012<br />&bull; Floor 9 North Corridor and spaces north of the North Corridor available Jan. 2010<br />&bull; Floors 8, 10-13 North Corridor and spaces north of the North Corridor available Apr. 2013 (portions of 8, 10, 13 are available Oct. 2012).<br />The contractor is encouraged to take advantage of any early delivery of spaces if approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>1.2.4 At the completion of Phase A, the Government will conduct an Activation / Occupancy Phase to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing. A similar Activation / Occupancy Phase will occur at the completion of Phase B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13. The CMc shall coordinate their activities as required with the Government's Occupancy Phases.</p>
<p>1.3 COMPLEXITY OF WORK</p>
<p>The project is a large scale renovation of biomedical research and inpatient hospital spaces into a modern biomedical research facility. Facilities of this type are highly complex and require extraordinary care and coordination to assure a successful completion. This project is demanding and complex due to the following:</p>
<p>1.3.1 The construction is going to take place on the NIH campus which has restricted access; extremely limited parking and very little site construction staging area.</p>
<p>1.3.2 The NIH requires that contractors provide off-site parking and shuttle service for their workers for the duration of their project. This cost shall be borne by the contractor. Construction workers are strictly prohibited from parking their personal vehicles on the NIH campus.</p>
<p>1.3.3 Properly marked company vehicles and equipment required in the performance of their project shall be permitted to park within the project approved staging areas. Personal vehicles are prohibited from parking within the staging areas.</p>
<p>1.3.4 The site is also is surrounded by urban neighborhoods that are sensitive to construction activities, particularly noise, truck traffic and thus has restrictions on work hours. The surrounding neighborhoods are very sensitive to contractor personnel parking on the residential streets. The contractor shall take appropriate measures to mitigate parking by contract employees in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>1.3.5 New state-of-the-art mechanical systems</p>
<p>1.3.6 Low floor-to-floor heights - mandating extreme care in the coordination of utility placements and sequencing.</p>
<p>1.3.7 Security - coordination of construction requirements within the operating Clinical Center Complex and the campus wide security efforts.</p>
<p>1.3.8 Occupied facility - Care will need to be taken to minimize the disruption and exposure to the adjacent occupied areas throughout the project duration. For example, <br />a. In the adjacent wing of Building 10 on the second floor sensitive surgeries will be conducted in Operating Rooms with utility and Joint Commission accreditation requirements, which must be addressed and supported at all times.<br />b. On the 11th floor F Wing Biosafety Level 2 infectious disease research with controlled infectious agents will continue to be conducted throughout the Phase A of the project. Loss of control of the directional air flow, interruption of the lab vacuum system, or loss of electrical power could lead to the contamination of those working with these samples and those in adjacent spaces.<br />c. During Phase B of the project, autopsies and critical analysis of patient pathology samples will be evaluated on the second and third floors of the F Wing. These spaces will be connected to the new utility systems which will be under renovation for the upper floors. Loss of utilities could impact the analysis of critical surgical, patient pathology specimens.<br />d. Main computer connections, which are located below the construction area in the F Wing, are critical to allow doctors to retrieve patient data from the Clinical Data Center and to place orders for the treatment of patients. If this utility were lost, patients' lives could be endangered.<br />e. Patient treatment standards for infection control, particularly with immune compromised patients, and sensitive research with optical instrumentation require tight control of dust and debris within and around Building 10.</p>
<p>1.3.9 Restricted space at the loading dock</p>
<p>1.4 CONSTRAINTS</p>
<p>1.4.1 Task 2 is a ARRA-funded project and as such the funds have to be fully obligated by September 30, 2010 and expended by September 30, 2015.<br />&bull;</p>
<p>1.4.2 The contractor must also not interrupt any of the NIH Governmental activities in the performance of his work, including the adjacent occupied areas within Building 10 which will remain operational, throughout the construction process.</p>
<p>1.4.3 The NIH has been declared as a No Smoking Campus. Smoking is not allowed at all on the NIH property; including construction sites</p>
<p>1.5 PROJECT GOALS<br />&bull; To provide a reliable, efficient, flexible, and adaptable facility that best suits its unique user requirements.<br />&bull; To develop a functional and conducive clinical research environment to ensure a high quality of life for staff, and an environment that attracts and retains world-class researchers.<br />&bull; To execute the Project at the most reasonable cost to the Government <br />&bull; To complete the Project in the most efficient and expeditious manner.<br />&bull; To minimize the disruption caused by the Project to ongoing NIH functions.</p>
<p>1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER as CONSTRUCTOR (CMc)</p>
<p>The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a GMP, the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541611   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Waste and Chemical Enforcement Division intends to award additional capacity to Kleimann Communication Group, Inc. (KCG) on a sole source basis for continuation of services underEPA purchase order EP09H001069.  The additional capacity is required to finish non-severable tasks associated with the challenges faced by the Division as a result of office reorganization.  The period of performance for this work will be date of award through June 30, 2010.  It has been determined that KCG is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirements, as they are the current contractor working on these non-severable projects.  KCG is the only company with the innate knowledge and experience to complete the requirements within the Government's schedule.  Additionally, it has been determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as well as, unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Office's requirements.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Any inquiries, requests for information or concerns must be addressed IN WRITING via e-mail to schwartz.rachel@epa.gov by January 4, 2010 at 1:00 p.m. EST. The Contracting Officer will not accept any telephone inquiries. The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence of that entity's capability to perform the same services and that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE POOL COATING 
<SOLNBR>AMD-10-SS28
<RESPDATE>011210
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing and installing a polymer-type liner to the NBSR Spent Fuel Storage Pool to prevent water leakage.  The installation of this coating is to be a permanent coating capable of lasting a minimum of 25 years.  The area to be coated is cast-in-place concrete which is currently covered with a hypalon coating.  The storage pool is used to store irradiated fuel assemblies and is filled with about 33,000 gallons of demineralized water (H2O) which contains radiological contamination.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Liner that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside. 

NIST has a need for a Nuclear Fuel Storage Pool Coating that would meet the following requirements:

Storage Pool Coating Project:
	Conduct status/planning meetings on a monthly basis, or more often if needed, from the award of the contract through the completion of the contract.
	Complete the storage pool coating project during an eight (8) week long planned reactor shutdown (target date is November and December 2011).
	Acquire Health Physics support that will provide all planning, materials, equipment and labor needed to maintain contamination containment control throughout the project.  Since NIST does not have an NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) Approved Respiratory Protection Plan, and does not plan to develop one, the contractor should be advised that should the airborne radiological conditions warrant, they will be required to meet all of the regulatory requirements, satisfy all the requirements for an NRC Approved Respirator Protection Program, and provide the properly trained and certified people to work under these conditions.  This would include contractor supplied Health Physics supervision and oversight.  It is expected and very likely that during the cleaning and surface preparations, depending on the methods used, the airborne radiological conditions will require these controls.
	Clean the storage pool (To avoid the spread of contamination this should be done while or before draining the pool. The use of a remote controlled climbing machine for coating removal/decontamination is highly recommended): remove existing coating; collect, dry and place into NIST supplied 55 gallon drums all radiological waste collected during the cleaning process.  Any water used in the cleaning process must be collected, filtered, and deionized.  Associated filters and ion-exchange resins must also be disposed of in NIST supplied drums.  NIST will handle the radioactive waste shipments for the disposal of the 55 gallon drums associated with the cleaning process.
	Drain the storage pool: properly dispose of the water or filter and store for return use later.  Contractor is responsible for all water processing, water storage containers, and radioactive waste shipment of water.
	Dry and prepare the storage pool: if necessary provide dewatering equipment, repair any dilapidated concrete; grind flush unused concrete anchors; mask and seal any remaining anchors, piping and equipment.
	Apply coating system (primer and coating).  The coating must be able to adhere to itself and be able to be overlapped for intermittent applications, and still provide a water tight seal that is structurally sound.  The coating must present a durable surface that will resist the compromise of the coating integrity due to impact from objects present in the normal work environment of the pool and the floor must be able to withstand compressive loads from fuel containers and casks.  The coating must be able to be repaired underwater.  The coating color must not inhibit the visibility of the pool water (i.e. white or light colors).
	Allow coating to dry.  It may be necessary to control ambient temperature and humidity during this time period.
	Remove all masking previously installed.
	Fill storage pool with ASTM Type II demineralized water or use the water previously drained from the pool that has been filtered to the same ASTM Type II Standard.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture Liners are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<RESPDATE>010810
<CONTACT>Keith Bubar, Contract Specialist, Phone 3019758329, Email keith.bubar@nist.gov
<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the services stated herein. All responsible parties capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public and Business Affairs Division (PBA) is the central point of contact for NIST for interactions with the general public and the news media. The office fields inquiries from the news media daily and is charged with setting strategic directions for fostering strong two-way communications between NIST program officers and reporters and editors who write about topics that fall within NIST's mission. To ensure that NIST maximizes its opportunities for media coverage describing its research results and other accomplishments, the agency needs up to date information on media contacts at a large number of different outlets, as well as a database application capable of sorting and reporting out information about inquiries from individual reporters. To gauge the effectiveness of its outreach to reporters, the Public Affairs Office also needs a comprehensive and timely way to access news media article describing its programs and analytical tools to gauge the expected audience for these clippings.</p>
<p>This requirement covers all tasks necessary to deploy an integrated media relations management system for use by NIST Public and Business Affairs. It includes migrating existing data from our reporter databases. This scope of work covers necessary training for ten (10) NIST staff members to use the product and support/maintenance for the product.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all equipment and labor for an integrated media relations management system that shall carry out the following tasks. The software system described below shall be compatible with the Windows XP operating system and be accessible from the Internet.<br /><br />a. Provide a news monitoring service that enables NIST PBA to obtain near-real-time reports of media coverage mentioning the NIST and related keywords. The news monitoring service shall include a comprehensive list of electronic print and Internet media sources, including daily newspapers, magazines, trade journals, Web sites, blogs, and science newsmagazines. The service shall deliver full text which shall be accessible for at least 120 days. The service shall provide the full text of articles from major publications as they appear on print if they differ from the Internet versions. Also desirable would be a broadcast monitoring service that flags coverage of NIST in broadcast and cable TV and/or radio programs. <br /><br />b. Provide a comprehensive, up-to-date, accurate database of news media contacts in the United States, including their contact information, coverage beats, and preferred methods of contact for reporters, with the ability to create customized mailing lists from within the database.<br /><br />c. Provide analytical tools that measure (on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-yearly, and yearly basis) the number of news stories that mention NIST or other specified keywords. The tools shall enable breakdowns in coverage by category (e.g., broadcast, top 50 newspapers). They shall provide comparisons and benchmarking against similar organizations.<br /><br />d. Enter records of media inquiries from journalists into the system and be able to retrieve these inquiries by keyword, reporter name, or date interval, with the ability to generate reports that call up desired media inquiry records and distributes them to desired recipients on a daily basis. <br /><br />e. Create daily reports of media coverage, containing the full text rather than simply links to the news coverage. These reports shall have the ability to be archived with the full text for at least 120 days and/or be exported into PDF or Microsoft Word files. The reports shall have the ability to include additional news coverage not captured by the vendor's service. The media coverage reports shall be electronically distributable to internal stakeholders, with copyright protection that ensures internal distribution rights of news articles. The reports shall be customizable so that the order of the news articles can be rearranged into a desired sequence, with the ability to annotate comments in the reports, preferably alongside each article.<br /><br />f. Create and update various mailing lists of reporters, and to be able to distribute news releases or other news items to these lists.<br /><br />g. Install necessary software and provide at least two (2) licenses for simultaneous use of their integrated media relations solution in the NIST Public and Business Affairs Office; provide user names for approximately 10 PBA staff; and supply necessary training for 10 PBA staff to use the system properly and optimally. The necessary technical support should be available, along with regular updates to the software.<br /><br />h. Migrate data on existing NIST reporter contacts and their inquiries from existing PBA databases, including ACT! Version 7 and the Oracle-based system, for use on the integrated media relations management system. There are approximately 700 reporters in the PBA database with the number of inquiries in the low thousands. The migrated data shall include reporter name, topic areas of interest as listed by PBA, and recorded media inquiries, and either the recorded contact information for the reporter or access to the vendor's contact information on the reporter.</p>
<p>NIST will provide PBA database records that are exported to XLS or CSV format. NIST will also provide a crosswalk of "the topic areas of interest" field from the legacy databases to the matching data field in the integrated media relations management system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to carry out the tasks and meet the deliverables discussed above are asked to respond to this notice with a capability statement including a detailed description of current capabilities to meet each requirement. Those sources capable of providing the aforementioned types of services are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to the NAICS code 519120 - Libraries and Archives (size standard of $7 million), and current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address). All responses shall be emailed to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov no later than 12:00 pm EST January 8, 2009.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase order with a base year plus four (4) optional years to the University of Oregon Museum of Natural History.  The University of Oregon Museum of Natural History will prepare a complete catalog of material in the Nunivak Island archaeological collection, which is currently housed at the Museum. The Museum will also stabilize the materials and curate the collection in perpetuity.
Archaeological work was conducted in the mid 1970's under Archaeological Resources Protection Act Permit (ARPA) and Dr. Nowak designated the University of Oregon Museum of Natural History as the final repository for the materials recovered from this work.  ARPA requires applicants for an archaeology permit to designate a public repository for the remains recovered.  As the collection was made on a wildlife refuge, responsibility for the care of the materials lies with the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service.
The museum took formal, legal possession (Accessioned) of the collection several years ago. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act requires a public repository for the remain recovered. Prior to the mid-1970s no suitable repository existed in Alaska. The University of Oregon Museum was the designated repository for the Nuivak Island collection. Moving the collection from one museum to another is a legal and logistical effort that would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government does not expect to be recovered through competition. 
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  See numbered note 22.

Document Type: 		Request for Information 

Release Date:			December 24, 2009

Response Date: 	December 31, 2009 at 4:30pm, EST via e-mail to Contract Specialist: William Lee at William.Lee@FDA.HHS.GOV  

Contracting Office Address:      Food and Drug Administration 
                                                      5630 Fisher Lane

Description: 	Maintenance and Repair Services	       	

This is a Request for Information to determine the availability and capability of small business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is being posted for fact finding and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this source sought. Any response received will not be used as a proposal. The FDA anticipates using a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  The NAICS code is 811219.


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities and prior experience to provide the following Services:

 Brand Name or Equal (Thermo Electron North America, LLC.)

LTQ XL MS Systems (S/N: LTQ20573, LTQ20574, LTQ20572, LTQ20562)

WORK DESCRIPTION

Each maintenance/service contract includes an unlimited number of demand on-site service visits with a maximum of 72-hour response time. The short response time is of critical value to the field labs to prevent building a back-log of samples. Most of the instruments in the labs operate around the clock to process samples that require a fast turn-around time due to numerous factors: perishable import samples need to be tested fast so as to make a decision on the admissibility of the product before it deteriorates at the dock, consumer-complaints need to be resolved as soon as possible, any analysis related to identifying outbreaks also is high-priority. Due to the sensitive nature of the analyses the ORA field labs have to perform on a daily basis, instrument reliability is of utmost importance. Instrument reliability can be achieved by appropriate service coverage administered by a professional company that can deliver the services in a fast, effective manner.

The service contract also includes support for technical inquiries within 2 hours. This is another very important feature the labs take advantage of routinely.  Many minor software or hardware problems may have simple solutions that can be addressed with technical phone support, thus further reducing instrument down-time.  Also, whenever the ORA field labs are faced with a new challenge, a new analyte to screen for, they have to rapidly develop new methods. Availability of advice from the vendors technical support staff when trying to run new methods on the instruments is a valuable resource. It aids in speedy implementation of new LC-MS methods to respond to new challenges.

The service contract also includes one preventative maintenance visit  maintenance visits prolong the life of the instruments, systematically replace consumable parts, and catch minor problems before they turn into big issues. Having the routine maintenance performed by the professionals most familiar with the instruments frees up time of FDA lab personnel.  These visits also ensure that laboratories are in compliance with quality management system requirements. 

The service contract also includes factory-certified replacement parts. 

The service contracts ensure reliable operation of the field instruments which in turn supports the critical analytical work the ORA labs perform on an everyday basis to promote food safety and defense. 


Part A. Capability and Technical Experience  Interested parties should submit capability statement describing adequate training and experience in scientific and technical appropriateness in reference to the potential work to be conducted in 

Part B. Size of Business  Please provide your business size (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) and submit copies of any documentation such as letters of certifications to indicate the firm status. 

Part C. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)  If any; provide disclosure of business activities of your company, your affiliates, and your team members and affiliates of your team members which create either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in the performance of the possible work on evaluation listed above.  

Part D. Small Business  Describe your ability to meet the requirements in accordance with 52.219.14  Limitation of Subcontracting.

<DESC><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of the Medicare program in 1965, Medicare has recognized the unique nature of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and HMO-like entities and has provided for alternative payment methodologies appropriate for such organizations. The original Medicare amendments to the Social Security Act included the authority for prepaid plans to receive payments for physician services on a basis other than individual charges. Even before the enactment of the federal HMO Act in 1973, the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act provided authority to contract with HMOs on a risk-sharing basis and on a cost basis.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities. MIP expands CMS's contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, allowing additional types of managed care organizations to secure Medicare contracts. A major intent of the BBA was to replace the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) with new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts.</p>
<p>A major intent of the BBA was to replace TEFRA with a new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts.</p>
<p>The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D ("Part D") that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) "local plans" formerly M+C plans, and creates a new type of private plan, "Regional" MA plans or Regional Preferred Provider Organizations (RPPOs).<strong><br /><br />Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CMS anticipates releasing one (1) solicitation for the award of multiple IDIQs for firm fixed price (FFP) task orders (contracts) for the examination engagement to review the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and/or Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and/or the Agreed-Upon Procedure (AUPs) review of Cost-Based Medicare Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) on and/or about Tuesday, December 22, 2009. <br /><br /><br /><em>Examination Engagement for Review of Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plans' Financial Information</em></p>
<p>CMS's Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which includes the mandated one-third financial audit requirement. OFM will conduct annual audits of the financial records of at least one third of the MAOs and PDPs as required by Sections 1857(d)(1) and 1860D-12 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the examinations are to provide assurance that Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug payments were proper and organizations' self reported information used to determine payment amounts were valid and correct. The audit contractor shall document the results of the examination, extrapolate the value of appropriate exceptions to the entire population and propose payment adjustments.</p>
<p>The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Uniform Examination Program (UEP) for the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) which, includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).</p>
<p>&bull; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)<br /><br />&bull; General Accounting Office Government Auditing Standards (2007 revision, Yellow Book)</p>
<p>&bull; Social Security Act (the Act) Titles XVIII and XIX and; the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) governing the MAO program including, standards and processes for imposing the enforcement provisions.<br /><br /><em>Agreed-Upon Procedure Review of Cost-Based Medicare Managed Care Organizations (MCO) Cost Reports</em></p>
<p>CMS's Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which include the oversight of cost-based managed care organizations as well as the mandated one-third financial audit requirement. OFM will conduct periodic audits of cost-based managed care organizations in accordance with Section 1876 of the Social Security Act and based on criteria established by CMS.</p>
<p>The objective of the Agreed-Upon Procedure (AUPs) review is to determine whether reimbursable costs claimed by the Managed Care Organization are reasonable, allowable, and allocable in accordance with applicable Medicare laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall evaluate the MCO's Medical Review programs and make recommendations for improvement. The review includes, but is not limited to, the review of the MCO procedures and internal controls over duplicate payments and situations when Medicare is a Secondary Payer (MSP). In addition, the Offeror shall evaluate the accuracy and allowability of Medical Coding (CPT codes) and related Relative Value Units (RVUs) (if applicable) to ensure fair apportionment and the accuracy of the claimed medical services costs. <br /><br />The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Agreed Upon Procedures (AUPs) for the Managed Care Organizations (MAOs) which, includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Thorough understanding of Medicare managed care cost reimbursement principles and the required cost reporting formats.</p>
<p>&bull; Thorough understanding of Medicare cost apportionment methodologies and the ability to distinguish administrative and general cost from plan administration costs and their respective allocation and apportionment methodologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&bull; Thorough understanding of the review of medical claims costs and the review of financial information relating to Managed Care Organizations.<br /><br /><br />(End of text)</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR NOAA <br />Open VMS Operating System and Layered Product IT Technical Support Services<br />DG133E-10-RP-1130
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) located in Silver Spring, MD is planning to procure Web/Internet IT support services to provide unlimited Technical support (24x7x365) for various versions of the Open VMS Operating System and Digital Equipment Corp (DEC)/Compaq/Hewlett-Packard(HP) branded Layered Products which run on (DEC)/Compaq/(HP) branded VAX, Alpha, and Itanium IT systems at a reasonable cost and adhering to high industry technical support standards for the Office of Satellite Operations. Provide a proposal consisting of your technical approach and price (fully loaded labor hour rates (hourly), and labor category, requesting contractors best estimate of required labor to do this level of effort) for satisfying the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO). Proposals will be evaluated based on the technical approach to satisfying the SOO, a review &amp; rating of resumes of planned persons (based on specific experience as required by the SOO), as well as reported past performance. Past performance is to be reported as part of proposal based on similar effort conducted in a federal or DoD environment during the last three years. The contracting officer will make a best value award decision weighing the technical merits of the proposed technical approach and personnel qualifications (resumes/experience) together with past performance as well as the overall mix of labor and price. Technical approach, resumes/experience, and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price, and the contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror to establish a best value for the Government. <br />Computer systems which are used to execute custom Telemetry and Command application programs are based upon the OpenVMS operating system, a product of the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). All offerors must be Hewlett Packard Authorized providers. While the OSO Software Support Branch does maintain a high level of expertise on these systems, there are instances where more detailed knowledge is necessary to resolve unusual operating system, and/or VMS Layered Product behaviors and/or problems.</p>
<p>The desired support structure will resolve VMS Operating System and Layered Product Application problems in a timely and effective manner which ensures maximum system availability. A US on-shore support source will provide a realistic time-coordinated means of communication between OSO and the support facility.</p>
<p>This is a 100% Small Business set-aside, the NAICS code for this action is 541519, with a size standard of $25 million. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation number is DG133E-10-RP-1130. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-31. This process is being conducted under the test procedures for the procurement of commercial items under the authority of FAR 13.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Requirements for OpenVMS Technical Support Services</p>
<p>The initial scope is to obtain an agreement to provide OpenVMS Operating System and VMS Layered Product Technical Support to a 24x7x365 operation through the use of direct telephone technical support (Help Desk) and/or through the use of vendor Technical Publication, Database, Knowledgebase, or Web-based customer access which encompasses the areas specified in the Performance Objectives, on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Period and Place of Performance; <br />Period of Performance shall be one (1) year with one additional one year option. The planned award date is late January 2010.<br />IT Systems are physically located at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland. However, the technical support services will be via telephone, vendor Internet web services, and/or email.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Office of Satellite Operations is responsible for the health and safety of the Nation's Weather Satellites, and is also responsible to ensure satellite instrument data is available to the users of that data. <br />Computer systems which are used to execute custom Telemetry and Command application programs are based upon the OpenVMS operating system, a product of the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). While the OSO Software Support Branch does maintain a high level of expertise on these systems, there are instances where more detailed knowledge is necessary to resolve unusual operating system, and/or VMS Layered Product behaviors and/or problems. <br />Historically, HP Software Technical Unlimited Support has been packaged as an integral part of the HP Software Update Service (SUS) Agreement. SUS is an annually recurring maintenance item necessary to comply with the Hewlett-Packard right to use the OpenVMS Operating System and Layered Products terms and conditions, and to maintain the right to version updates and product patches offered by HP. HP has de-coupled SUS and Technical Support and allows a customer to obtain those items separately. A list of components to be supported is as follows.</p>
<p>The desired support structure will resolve VMS Operating System and Layered Product Application problems in a timely and effective manner which ensures maximum system availability. A US on-shore support source will provide a realistic time-coordinated means of communication between OSO and the support facility.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Provide an equivalent (or better) direct replacement of` HP Software Technical Unlimited Support, on a 24x7x365 schedule, which includes (at a minimum), assistance in the following areas: <br />System Startup/Shutdown Sequences <br />Network Device Configuration <br />Backup and Restore processes <br />General Troubleshooting of the OS and Layered Products <br />Crash Dump Analysis <br />Performance Recommendations <br />Language Compiler usage and error diagnostics <br />Crash Dump Analysis <br />System/File/User Security Management Parameters <br />2. Call Management - Clear, concise, and direct communications are key factors: <br />Eliminate Phone Menu systems to the greatest extent possible <br />Typical Response within 2 hours of initial call <br />Initiate Problem Tracking upon first call contact <br />Provide Progress Updates as the problem is being worked <br />Make Problem Report Summary available upon request <br />Allow for Multiple Points of Contact to access vendor resources</p>
<p>3. Technical Experience in OpenVMS OS and Layered Products: <br />Technical Account Manager; average 20-25 years <br />Senior Level Technicians; 15-20 years each</p>
<p>4. Prior Version Support: <br />Be able to provide technical support for all versions of OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha from v6.2 to and including the currently shipping version</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Period of Contract:  This contract shall become effective for a period of one year after date of award with the Government's option to extend for two additional one-year periods.3.  Cancellation by the Government:  The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may cancel this agreement in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the Government.4.  Order:  In the event that the VASLCHCS should have a requirement to purchase replacement item(s), the VASLCHCS may do so at the price quoted by the Contractor in the Schedule.  Contractor agrees to accept the VA Purchase Card as the preferred method of payment.  Purchase orders will be issued when deemed appropriate by the Medical Center.  Reimbursement is made only if and when use of the item(s) is made by the VA.  The physician will have the responsibility to determine which item to use.  Occasionally specific patients may require a special implant not available on the consignment list.  These items may be purchased directly from the contractor on an open market basis.  Special implants that become routinely used will be added to the agreement by a modification issued by the Contracting Officer.  If the Contractor cannot provide special implants for specific patients, then the VA may procure the implants from another contractor.  The physicians of this medical center will have final approval for acceptance of products.5.  Physical Inventory:  All consignment inventories will be coordinated with VA Prosthetic staff.  Contractor will remove or replace inventory as necessary.  VA Prosthetic staff may request that inventory having less than 90 days sterility/expiration date be removed and replaced.  A list of all products will be provided to the Contracting Officer.  These services will be completed at no cost to the Government.  Contractor's personnel will periodically (no less than (4) times per year) conduct a physical inventory of the consignment inventory, with copy of inventory furnished to the Contracting Officer.6.  Liability:  The Government assumes no liability for any item(s) assigned to the VASLCHCS on a consignment basis until such time as a requirement for the item(s) exists and a delivery order is placed against the agreement.  Transportation charges will be borne by the Contractor for all delivery orders placed against the agreement.7.  Defects:  The Contractor will replace defective products at no charge to the Government, unless the Government has misused or lost products.8.  Returns:  Unused items will be returned to the Contractor at the end of the effective period of the consignment without reimbursement or other expenses to the VA.  The Contractor will remove unused items for the VASLCHCS within thirty (30) days after written notification of the completion or cancellation of consignment agreement.9.  Alteration of Quantities under Consignment:  The Contractor agrees that the total quantity of items furnished under this agreement can be changed at any time during the effective period of this agreement, if approved by both the Contractor and the VASLCHCS.  Terms of payment will apply to all additional items.10.  Technical Support:  Contractor technical support will be available twenty-four (24) hours a day in order to provide consultation on technical issues and in-service training as needed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the construction of a Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Depot Maintenance Facility. The proposed procurement is 100% Small Business Set-Aside with NAICS code 236220 with a size standard of $33.5M. The construction of the Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Depot Maintenance Facility will be located at Tobyhanna Army Depot Pennsylvania. The solicitation will be available on or about 18 December 2009 with proposal due on or about 19 January 2010. Estimated cost of the construction will be between $1M and $5M. Construction duration is 360 days.<br />The requirement will be for the renovation of existing maintenance facilities that will relocate depot maintenance workload from Seal Beach to TYAD. Construction and installation tower is necessary in order to perform operational testing of specific radar systems at Seal Beach; and an existing bay (40,000 sf) within TYAD's maintenance complex requires relatively minor facilitization to permit the set up, repair, and testing of various systems and their associated pedestals. The bay is available for use, but requires selected upgrades to the electrical power, lighting, floor coating, air system, and other characteristics. The facility will also require installation of a crane for efficient material handling of end items and sub-assemblies.<br /><br />All qualified responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format on or around the 18th of December 2009. After issuance of the solicitation, contractors may view and/or download the solicitation and all amendments. Plans and specifications will not be available in paper format. Oral Communications are not acceptable. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). You must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration Database (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) to receive a Government contract award.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
RQ 21000-10-6034
Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve
the issuance of the contractual action discussed below using
other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority
cited herein.
1. Contracting Activity.
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
6432 General Green Way
Alexandria, VA 22312-2413
2. Nature and Description of Action Being Approved:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to award a
sole source requirement for access to current and historical
news and in-depth analysis of the mutual fund industry to Money-
Media in New York, NY. This is a new contract action.
3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the
needs of the SEC and the estimated value:
The requirement is for Commission-wide access via the Internet
to current and historical news and in-depth analysis of the
mutual fund industry. The requirement is for access to Money-
Medias Ignites.com, which includes:
 original current news, in-depth analysis, and summaries of
news reported in other sources
 topics such as fund operations and technology, compliance,
sales and marketing, exchange-traded funds, annuities, and
brokers
 daily headlines with links to the full-text articles
 online videos of industry speakers from major industry
events
 news coverage of people in the mutual fund industry
 calendar of events for upcoming mutual funds conferences
 article archive back to 1999.
The estimated contract value is $27,760.00, which will use FY10
funds.
4. Statutory Authority for Other Than Full and Open
Competition:
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open
competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) - Only one
responsible source.
5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique
qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the
authority cited:
Money-Media is uniquely able to fill the requirement for the
following reasons:
 Money-Medias Ignites.com is the only product capable of
providing current news, historical archives back to 1999,
an events calendar, and video clips.
 Money-Medias publications are copyrighted by Money-Media,
and are not available from any other source.
6. Efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as Many
Potential Sources as Possible.
There are no efforts being made to solicit offers from
sources other than Money-Media for the current requirement.
Money-Media is the only vendor capable of delivering the
information that is required by the Commission. The requirement
was transmitted to GPE on [12/24/2009] and, if warranted by the
response to such notice, this action will be reviewed.
7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the
anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
Before awarding a contract, the Contracting Officer will
perform a price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b) (and
a cost analysis, if required) to determine whether the price is
fair and reasonable.
8. Description of market research conducted and results or
statement of the reasons market research was not conducted:
Knowledgeable individuals in the Library surveyed
information sources in the field of mutual funds via the
Internet and determined that Money-Media is the only vendor
capable of meeting the requirement.
9. Other Supporting Facts:
None
10. A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing
an interest in the acquisition:
A list of sources that express an interest in actions under
this J&A will be maintained in the applicable contract files.

remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any
subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:
The Commissions information requirements are ongoing and
future acquisitions of similar services will be advertised.
