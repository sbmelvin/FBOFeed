Statement of Work for upgrading or replacing the existing Land Mobile Radio Communication System Console. Existing System: Currently we are using a Motorola CentraCom Communication Console System. The system consists of 6 operator positions 4 in the main hanger and 2 in the operations building. The system is used to give our Commander's command and control ove r the 15 different VHF/UHF radio nets on base with ease and quickness. The Motorola console equipment was installed in 1990. We currently are using all Motorola radios for both our base stations, handhelds and mobile radios using both digital and analog te chnologies. All the six operator positions are housed in Dunco console furniture. Requirements for upgrade or replacement system: The upgrade or replacement system would need to have 6 operat or positions 4 in the hanger and 2 in operations plus have the ability to add more positions if needed at a later date. Would like the 6 operator positions to be computer-based using large touch screens. The system would need to control and interface with 15 different VHF/UHF radio nets plus allow for more nets in the future. The system would also need to be able to interface with both analog and digital radios until our goal of an all-digital net is met. We would like to use as much of the current console furniture as possible. During the upgrade or replacement both systems would need to be working so that minimal down time occurs. The upgrade or replacement system would need to interface with the following Motorola radio systems: Quantar Repeaters/Base Sta tions, Astro Consollette Base Stations, Astro mobiles, XTS 5000 handhelds and XTS 3000 handhelds. In the case of being forced by NTIA in a few years to a trunked system, the console would need to be able to work in this environment with no more than a nomi nal upgrade cost needed to make the switch. (For purposes of any resulting contract the government defines nominal upgrade cost as $2000) Last the system must have the capability to support DES and TYPE-1 encrypted subscribers.
