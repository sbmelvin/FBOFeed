How long did you want the UPS run time to be?
ANSWER - This is to clarify the UPS requirements for the St. Croix CCTV system. The 3000KVA requested is erroneous. Vendor  should provide an APC Smart UPS, 1000VA, Tower UPS or similar<BR><BR>BECAUSE THE PLACE OF PERFORMANCE SHALL TAKE PLACE AT A PORT AUTHORITY FACILITY, TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD, OFFERORS MUST PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE WITH A GENERAL LIABILITY LIMIT OF AT LEAST $1,000,000.00 ($1M).
