<DESC>THE NAVAL EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (NAVEOTECHDIV) HAS A NEED TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE TECHNOLOGIES TO DETECT, ACCESS, EXAMINE, RENDER SAFE, AND DISPOSE OF UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO).  WHITE PAPERS/FULL PROPOSALS FOR EXPLORATORY DEVELOPMENT ARE SOUGHT IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: 1)     LOCATE HIDDEN DEVICES: CURRENTLY THERE IS NO GOOD WAY FOR EOD TECHNICIANS TO EASILY DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL COMMAND POST AREA MAY CONTAIN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.  THE TECHNICIANS NEED A SMALL PORTABLE DEVICE THAT WILL GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE IF AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND/OR RF INITIATOR IS LOCATED WITHIN A POTENTIAL COMMAND POST AREA.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE DETECTOR WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE HIDDEN DEVICES WITHIN A 20 M RADIUS. 2)     ENSURE UXO IS INACTIVE: THE ADVENT OF ELECTRONICALLY SAFED AND ARMED FUZE (ESAF) DEVICES YIELDS FUZES THAT CANNOT BE READILY INSPECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR SOLID-STATE CONFIGURATION.  ADDITIONALLY, INTERROGATION OF THE FUZES FROM THE OUTSIDE IS AT BEST DIFFICULT DUE TO THE SHIELDING AROUND THE FUZE.  ELECTRONICS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO ESAFS WHICH WHEN REMOTELY POLLED BY EOD TECHNICIANS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUZE STATUS.  3)     DETECTION/LOCATION OF SUBMERGED UXO: CURRENTLY, LIMITED TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO DETECT SUBMERGED UXO.  TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED THAT CAN AID THE EOD TECHNICIAN IN DETECTING AND LOCATING BOTH FERROUS AND NONFERROUS UXO SUBMERGED IN SALT OR FRESH WATER AND POTENTIALLY COVERED BY MUD AND SILT. 4)     DETERMINE FUZE MATERIALS: IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY MODEL RENDER SAFE PROCEDURES FOR FUZES IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MATERIALS THAT MAKE UP THE FUZE.  THERE IS A NEED FOR TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE TYPES OF MATERIALS USED IN FUZES FROM A STANDOFF DISTANCE AND PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE EOD TECHNICIAN.   5)     EXAMINE IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (IEDS) WITHOUT ACTUATING SENSORS: THE EQUIPMENT CURRENTLY USED BY THE EOD TECHNICIAN TO EXAMINE AN IED COULD CAUSE INITIATION OF ADVANCED ANTI-TAMPERING SENSORS.  NEW EXAMINATION SENSORS AND TECHNIQUES ARE NEEDED THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPONENTS OF THE IED AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT ITS STATUS. 6)     EXPLOSIVES DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES: THE NAVAL EOD TECHNOLOGY DIVISION IS INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE USEFULNESS OF X-RAY FLUORESCENCE FOR DETECTING EXPLOSIVES IN VARIOUS CONTAINERS AND VEHICLES. 7)     ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR: CURRENT ROBOTIC MANIPULATORS USED BY EOD HAVE A VERY LIMITED LEVEL OF DEXTERITY.  THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP MANIPULATORS THAT CAN PICK UP AND HANDLE OBJECTS LESS THAN 2 INCHES IN SIZE (E.G. WIRE, ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS, AND SMALL PRESSURE SENSITIVE EXPLOSIVE DETONATORS) WITHOUT PHYSICALLY DAMAGING THE OBJECT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE MANIPULATOR MUST BE ABLE TO BE MOUNTED ON A MOBILE ROBOTIC PLATFORM AND HAVE THE REQUISITE AUTOMATION OR CONTROLLABILITY TO BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED BY THE EOD OPERATOR TO PERFORM DIFFICULT TASKS (E.G. GRASPING AND MANIPULATING SMALL OBJECTS). 8)     ROBOTIC ARM: CURRENT EOD ROBOTIC ARMS HAVE VERY LIMITED DEGREES OF FREEDOM.  THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP A MULTI-ARTICULATED ROBOTIC ARM AND ROBOTIC SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO AID IN RENDERING SAFE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. 9)     TACTILE TECHNOLOGY: CURRENT EOD ROBOTIC MANIPULATORS PROVIDE NO TACTILE FEEDBACK TO THE USERS.  THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN PROVIDE TACTILE FEEDBACK TO EOD TECHNICIANS AS WELL AS USE THEIR HAND AND ARM MOVEMENTS TO AID IN CONTROLLING THE ROBOTIC ARM AND ACTUATOR. 10)     PRODUCT FAMILY CONCEPTS FOR EOD ROBOTS: CURRENT EOD UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES ARE STANDALONE SYSTEMS, EACH HAVING PROPRIETARY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE COST AND INCREASE SUPPORTABILITY AND RELIABILITY THERE IS A NEED TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL USE OF PRODUCT FAMILIES FOR FUTURE EOD ROBOTIC SYSTEMS.  THE USE OF PRODUCT FAMILIES WOULD ALLOW MULTIPLE EOD ROBOTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES TO SHARE COMMON OR SCALED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPONENTS.  WHITE PAPERS/FULL PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT FOR STUDIES THAT EXPLORE HOW THIS CONCEPT CAN BE APPLIED TO EOD ROBOTICS  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WHITE PAPERS AND FULL PROPOSALS: WHITE PAPERS/FULL PROPOSALS SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS: NAVAL EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, ATTN: MARGARET BOOTH, CODE 052, BLDG. 2112, 2008 STUMP NECK ROAD, INDIAN HEAD, MD 20640-5070.

<DESC>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) plans to issue a sole source Simplified Acquisition to the University of Greenwich, Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London, UK, to develop evacuation computer model software to predict the time periods necessary for occupants to evacuate passenger rail cars to a point of safety during emergency conditions.  The University previously developed a software model known as Exodus.  Exodus   incorporates occupant characteristics and behavior of individual passengers, as well as individual decision-making affecting real evacuation time within its model software.  The Exodus suite of software packages is tailored to provide computer-modeling capability for emergency evacuation from buildings, aircraft and ships. The contractor is  to develop a prototype computer model for occupant emergency egress behavior using the Exodus software program for the most widely used types of passenger rail cars in United States.  The software to be developed shall  be able to: (1) conduct evacuation simulations from various types of rail cars, under various emergency scenarios and different conditions (e.g. weather, day, night); (2) shall  interface with the Consolidated Fire and Smoke Transport (CFAST) fire growth computer model previously developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the Federal Railroad Administration, and (3) shall allow for manipulation of the data to control the variables of the research (including data evaluation and date verification).  The applicable North American Industry C lassification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541511 and the small business size standard is $21.0 million. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

<DESC>This is a notice of contract action. 
The Air Force intends to release a request for proposal on or about 15 Aug 2005.  This contract would provide special security services in support to SMC program offices at Los Angeles AFB and several other sites within Air Force Space Command.  Requirements include industrial security, automated information security, physical security, personnel security, security reviews, security education and training, acquisition security, program security officer duties, program protection planning, security classification development/management, system security engineering, information management, and document control.  All personnel on the contract must possess a Top Secret clearance with SSBI.  Although the source selection will be conducted in an unclassified manner, the resulting contract will be classified.  Therefore, upon contract award, the company must also possess a facility that meets DCID 6/9 standards. The basic contract shall have a one-year period of performance with four one-year options.  The current planned period of performance for the basic year shall be from 17 November 2005-16 November 2006. 
A draft RFP is provided on the SMC/SY website for your review and comment.  The goal for this future solicitation will be a competitive award without discussions.  To achieve this, the Government is actively engaging the contractor community to ensure thorough understanding of the requirements and objectives.  Interested offerors are highly encouraged to submit comments and questions on the draft RFP anytime, but preferably before 8 Aug 05.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561621.  The small business size standard is $10.5M.  


All potential offerors should be aware that the Contracting Officer has identified a potential organizational conflict of interest in providing these special security services.  These services include critical evaluation of other contractor's security practices.  The solicitation that the Government is contemplating, if issued, will include language that prohibits any awardee from holding any other prime contract and/or subcontract with the system program offices and field sites for design, research and development, or production.  The potential awardee must have complete autonomy to provide objective services to the Government.  Submit all unclassified responses to SMC/SYK, Attn: Capt Atchley, 2420 Vela Way, Ste 1420, A-5, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.  Initial award of any resultant contract is anticipated by November 17, 2005.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for continuation of services on Contract NAS5-00220 with Science Systems and Applications, Inc (SSAI) under the authority of other than full and open competition  10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) – Only One Responsible Source.   The Space and Earth Sciences Data Analysis (SESDA) Contract NAS5-00220 with SSAI is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion contract with a 5-year period of performance through November 30, 2005.  As an interim measure, in order to continue critical work until a new contract can be awarded, an increase in the contract’s period of performance is required.  This increase will enable the government to continue performance during the evaluation process of the competitive follow-on acquisition for an additional 3 months while crucial activities are continuing to occur.  The support to be provided by SSAI is a continuation of work currently performed under this contract.	SSAI possesses unique and specialized experience critical to the successful completion of critical milestones. The experience of the team is essential in the identification of and recovery from operational system failures and in the quality assurance of products delivered to the end users.  SSAI also provides the technical expertise to integrate the highly specialized model and analysis software into an operational system and to analyze the system performance in a validation framework.  SSAI is the only company with the capability of providing the technical support without a reduction or disruption in service.  Any other contractor would be required to (1) train people in the operational procedures established for the generation of these specialized products; (2) train people to support scientific research, algorithm development, and data production; and (3) hire an adequate number of staff from the limited pool of specialized scientists who have experience in the development and evaluation of models and assimilation systems and in the use of satellite data streams to meet all the critical milestones. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 29, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for: Ice Trials Support for Operator Guidance Manual Development of USCGC Mackinaw. It is anticipated that a non-competitive sole source BPA Call will be issued for this study to Parsons Associates, Bellevue WA under BPA HSCG40-04-A-60332 (Task 2 Item 3.2 and Task 3 item 3.3, Call no 06-6001) unless additional sources are located. All responsible sources are invited to express their interest and ABILITY to provide the above-described service via fax or e-mail to Mr. Orofino no later than November 18, 2005. It is the Government's belief that only Parsons Associates can provide this support. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above service are invited to submit complete information discussing the same in duplicate within 5 days of this announcement.  However, potential sources other than Parsons Associates desiring to furnish services are required to submit the following information: Data that the offered service has been satisfactorily provided to the government. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. All responsive and responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by this agency. 
The justifications for other than full and open competition for this purchase are as follows:
a.	The organization selected to perform this work, Parsons Associates International (PAI), has highly specialized expertise and experience in instrumentation and testing in ice of icebreakers.  The principal of PAI is Mr. Robert J. Parsons, a retired USCG Captain with extensive experience as a Commanding Officer of both the USCG POLAR STAR and the existing USCGC MACKINAW on the Great Lakes.  He was also involved with and was instrumental in the planning of the USCGC HEALY Ice Trials held in the spring of 2000.  Hence, PAI is able to provide highly specialized services in fulfillment of this task from a possibly limited number of sources with these unique capabilities.
b.	Mr. Parsons of PAI has been involved with all of the test planning that has taken place to date for the ice trials of the new USCGC MACKINAW, and as a result of the Ice Trials Planning Meetings conducted to date, is familiar with the current plans for the instrumentation envisioned for the ice trials.  Furthermore, Mr. Parsons of PAI developed the current version of the ice trials manual.  Hence, the use of PAI for this task will preclude substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer, 732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs.  Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources.Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment.  Depending upon respondents capabilities an d the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment/repair/overhaul.  Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair progr ams that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with info rmation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request.  Companies capable of performing this effort m ay respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS -N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS: avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>SUBJECT: _—JNTC BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATED TO RAPID DISTRIBUTED DATABASE DEVELOPMENT (RD3) TO SUPPORT LIVE, VIRTUAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE (L-V-C) COMPONENTS OF A JOINT NATIONAL TRAINING CAPABILITY (JNTC) 
BAA#:  N61339-04-R-0031

United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) is collecting information for the research and development (R&D) of Advanced Training Technologies (ATT) that will enable Rapid Distributed Database Development (RD3) in support of establishing a robust Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  USJFCOM is leading a DoD-wide effort to establish interoperability of various types of models and simulations among themselves and with Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and data, order of battle data, force data, target data, geospatial data, visualization data, and other data required to support the development of common services and associated standard interfaces that will enable interoperability in training.   

The RD3 initiative is seeking technical solutions to the definition, design, development, and support of an integrated system for collecting, manipulating, storing, and retrieving data in a usable form to support anticipated future requirements for Joint planning, training, mission rehearsal, and experimentation.  The RD3 architecture shall support the reduction of development time for virtual and constructive databases to 3 - 4 days, to support Joint mission planning and rehearsal.  In order to achieve this performance objective, the architecture must allow distributed end-user participation in Live, Virtual, and Constructive (L-V-C) simulation and C4I federation database production processes relevant to the Joint Event Life Cycle.  The resulting system design must allow operational and technical users associated with a particular event to define and enter database production cases, rapidly assess the availability of authoritative representations of the operational environment (terrain, atmosphere, ocean, space and associated models of natural and artificial objects), weapons and warfighting platforms, friendly and enemy force structure, integrated target databases, and human and organizational performance.  The system must also allow the users to access data from archives of previously created scenario databases, perform data correlation and normalization across data types to a common baseline, support configuration management and control of the baseline, allow editing and validation of the baseline across an event community, and output the data in commonly used simulation and C4I formats (i.e. SEDRIS Transmittal Format, XML, etc) used for simulation federation engine initializations.  Additionally, common services include knowledge integration technologies and tools for data interchange, Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A), and life cycle support of RD3 system components.

USJFCOM is seeking information from Industry and Academia on all related Live, Virtual, and Constructive (L-V-C) enabling technology development efforts that could enhance RD3 in the areas of applications and tools (data generation, collection, transformation, and configuration management), data standards (import, export, distribution, archiving, and metadata), processes that promote interoperability, data storage, integration, real-time data updates, interfaces, and dataset production functional and life cycle processes, including dataset fusion, normalization, baseline control, and VV&A.

In support of USJFCOM’s R&D efforts, Naval Air Systems Command, Orlando Training System Division is announcing that a JNTC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA - N61339-04-R-0031) is released with a topic area focused on RD3 research and development.  This Broad Agency Announcement is intended to cover, in general, all R&D areas of interest for the JNTC Program and its customers.  Specific scientific points of contact for each research area will be identified on page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the JNTC Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  

Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA, and to assess organizational interest in the RD3 effort, interested firms are invited to receive a program briefing at the RD3 Industry/Academia Day forum and participate in a question and answer session.  All briefings will be unclassified.  Due to seating limitations, each interested firm is limited to no more than two representatives at the group meeting.  JFCOM plans to host the RD3 Industry/Academia Day meeting on or about June 8, 2004 in the Orlando, Florida Area.  Firms interested in attending the industry day must contact Benn Aaronson, NAVAIR-Orlando , at (407) 380-8250 (benn.aaronson@navy.mil) or Bill Wolfinger, NAVAIR Orlando, at (407) 380-4265 (bill.wolfinger@navy.mil) no later than May 21, 2004. 

To download a copy of the BAA, visit NAWCTSD’s Open Acquisitions webpage at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm (click on Open Acquisitions) on or about May 6, 2004.  Be advised that periodic access to the website is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding this announcement.  Questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below or in this announcement.  

Government organizations, commercial companies, universities, and other non-profit organizations capable of conducting appropriate research and development, in whole or part, are invited to submit an affirmative response to this announcement.  Following the briefing, interested parties will be requested to submit research and development recommendations/ideas under the JNTC BAA, in a white paper format (not to exceed ten pages in length, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum); as well as capability statements, catalogs, or their published literature that describes their research and development activities, products and product capability.  The white papers shall address at a minimum; RD3 related research, development, and demonstration ideas/capability; technical challenge that can be addressed; maturity of the M&S technology; previous experience with similar efforts; a point of contact; and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to implement the research effort.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a contract to L-3 Communications, for the Completion of Development of the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Airborne System Development, Integration and Test portion of the SOFIA program. HISTORY  The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub-millimeter observations. The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center). The SOFIA observatory will be the world’s largest and most sensitive airborne observatory. The aircraft shall operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet. At stratospheric altitudes the telescope and its suite of scientific instruments can collect radiation with wavelengths of 0.3 micrometers to 1.6 millimeters. The telescope shall peer out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft, and will allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before. The astronomers, technicians, engineers and flight crews will work in a comfortable airliner environment during a typical eight to ten hour flight. The estimated life of the operational program is 20 years.  In December 1996, NASA awarded a contract to the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) to serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for development if the SOFIA Airborne System, and the Science and Mission Operations as well as the deliver the first 10 years of science missions to collect and analyze data in the infrared (IR) spectrum. Raytheon, (although later acquired by L3 Communications) was originally proposed by USRA as and was a major subcontractor under the USRA contract and is responsible for the design, development, test, integration and delivery of a structurally modified B747-SP.  The mid-nineties was a period in which “privatization” was widely espoused as a beneficial method for the Government to pursue and acquire its mission needs. Central to the privatization model is a minimal involvement of the Government in either insight or oversight roles, deferring largely to the contractor to manage the program.  It became apparent as NASA moved deeper into the development phase, that SOFIA was even more complex in its requirements, namely the structural modifications, the integration of a large IR telescope provided by DLR, the NASA German partners, and the overhaul and airworthiness actions associated with the certification of the aircraft for flight. The effect of the many challenges in these areas resulted in development schedule delays, thereby impacting the delivery of critical research data to the research community and increasing program cost. These impacts resulted in a decision in May 2005, supported by several reviews of the SOFIA program, that it was critical that NASA restructure the program to enable the completion of development and the commencement of science data collection and analysis.  CURRENT PROGRAM STATUS  This project (SOFIA Airborne System development) is approximately 85% complete. All major modification efforts on the aircraft have been designed, engineered and nearly completely installed. Some ground testing has been accomplished. Certain observatory unique subsystems, such as electronics equipment are still being developed for later installation. The telescope assembly has been installed in the aircraft and has undergone basic operational testing. The work remaining on the aircraft includes some development and completion of installations, but primarily entails systems integration and ground and flight performance testing.  The SOFIA program restructure addresses both internal government changes as well as a realignment of the contractual relationships for the major SOFIA segments which include: 1) SOFIA Completion of Development, Integration and Test segment, to include all activities necessary to complete development and enable operational flight, 2) Science and Mission Operations, 3) Aircraft operations, and 4) Government integration. In 1996, the SOFIA program was structured as a prime contractor/subcontractor arrangement, with USRA serving as the prime. Under the restructure, the Government will enter into prime contracts for each segment and assume a larger role in the oversight and integration aspect of the overall SOFIA program.  STATEMENT OF WORK  The work to be accomplished under this procurement shall consist of the completion of the development of the SOFIA Airborne System.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is for heritage resource inventories and site evaluations for the Black Hills and Nebraska National Forests. The resulting contracts will be used to assist the Black Hills and Nebraska National Forests in conducting compliance inventories and site evaluations that will support the forests in carrying out a variety of resource projects which may include timber sales, road construction and reconstruction, land exchanges, prescribed burns, mechanical thinning, range allotments, and range improvement projects. 

The contractor will be responsible for conducting Class/Level I, II, and III inventories, site subsurface testing, site evaluations, site monitoring, preparing inventory reports, site monitoring forms, curation of collected materials, and submitting GIS data.  It is estimated that inventory needs will include approximately 40,000 acres per year for each of the next five years covering multiple planning areas, and hence resulting in multiple task orders issued each year.  

The purpose of the inventories are to survey, identify, record, and evaluate for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), all heritage resources (historic or prehistoric cultural manifestations 50 or more years old) within project or analysis areas defined in each task order. Data derived from this project will be used for compliance with the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended (NHPA), and the Archeological Resources Protection Act, as amended (ARPA), pertaining to potential effects on heritage resources. 

The resultant contracts will be awarded as Firm Fixed Priced, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, Multiple Award Service Contracts, with a base year and a possibility of 4 Option Years. 

Numbered Notes 1 Applies.

Request for Quote procedures will be utilized for award.

All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to Solicitation FA8601-05-R-0082 1.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional clarification  on the chamber size.  Questions arose after Amendment 1 was posted to  prompt this amendment. Question One: Overall dimensions only are addressed in the PWS, not the chamber size.  It's critical to know the chamber size.  Since the workspace of the shroud  is 36", would the minimum size 42" be required?  Or do you have another  size dimension requirement for the chamber?  In other words, what exactly  is the dimension requirement “size” of the chamber?  Will 42” suffice?  What would you like to have in the chamber size diameter? Answer: The minimum working space will be a Diameter of 36" with a depth of 36"  with the shroud in place.  The maximum is 42” (note: must fit through the  doors and hallway - see drawing attached to annoucement under "Revised  Drawing"). Question Two: How many copies of the materials need to be submitted with the price  quote? Answer: Vendors shall submit at least one copy of the complete quotation package,  including price quote, technical capability information (if not previously  submitted) along with the Representations and Certifications document. Question Three: Can the materials/quotation be hand delivered? Answer: Due to increased security base access is limited.  Therefore to eliminate  problems which may arise for hand delivery of quotation packages,  recommend one of the following methods for quotation submittal:  Quotations may be faxed, with coversheet, to Ms. Jacque Davis,  937-656-1412, electronically submitted via email to  Jacqueline.Davis@wpafb.af.mil, or mailed to Ms Jacque Davis, 88 CONS/PKB,  1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309. Question Four: Can I send an executable (.exe)  or a zip (.zip) file through the email  system containing my quotation? Answer: The servers at Wright-Patterson do not allow receipt of executable (.exe)  or zip (.zip) files.  However, Word documents (.doc), or .pdf files are  acceptable. 2.  As a result of the request for additional clarification, the closing  date is hereby changed to Tuesday, 11:30 a.m. (EDT) on 22 November 2005.  Prospective bidders are reminded that complete quotation packages,  including price quote, technical capability information (if not previously  submitted) and Representations and Certifications shall be submitted by  Tuesday, 11:30 a.m. (EDT) on 22 November 2005, to Ms Jacque Davis, 88  CONS/PKB, 1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-5309. *********************************** Amendment 1 to Solicitation FA8601-05-R-0082 The purpose of this amendment is to revise the drawing originally posted  with the solicitation.

<DESC>RFP Amendment A00001 is posted on the following website.

 


Website – http://www.losangeles.af.mil/SMC/SY/




This is a notice of contract action. 
The Air Force intends to release a request for proposal on or about 15 Aug 2005.  This contract would provide special security services in support to SMC program offices at Los Angeles AFB and several other sites within Air Force Space Command.  Requirements include industrial security, automated information security, physical security, personnel security, security reviews, security education and training, acquisition security, program security officer duties, program protection planning, security classification development/management, system security engineering, information management, and document control.  All personnel on the contract must possess a Top Secret clearance with SSBI.  Although the source selection will be conducted in an unclassified manner, the resulting contract will be classified.  Therefore, upon contract award, the company must also possess a facility that meets DCID 6/9 standards. The basic contract shall have a one-year period of performance with four one-year options.  The current planned period of performance for the basic year shall be from 17 November 2005-16 November 2006. 
A draft RFP is provided on the SMC/SY website for your review and comment.  The goal for this future solicitation will be a competitive award without discussions.  To achieve this, the Government is actively engaging the contractor community to ensure thorough understanding of the requirements and objectives.  Interested offerors are highly encouraged to submit comments and questions on the draft RFP anytime, but preferably before 8 Aug 05.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561621.  The small business size standard is $10.5M.  


All potential offerors should be aware that the Contracting Officer has identified a potential organizational conflict of interest in providing these special security services.  These services include critical evaluation of other contractor's security practices.  The solicitation that the Government is contemplating, if issued, will include language that prohibits any awardee from holding any other prime contract and/or subcontract with the system program offices and field sites for design, research and development, or production.  The potential awardee must have complete autonomy to provide objective services to the Government.  Submit all unclassified responses to SMC/SYK, Attn: Capt Atchley, 2420 Vela Way, Ste 1420, A-5, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.  Initial award of any resultant contract is anticipated by November 17, 2005.

BE ADVISED:

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call SMC/DS at (310) 363-3571.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/29/05.  Proposals shall be received on or about 1/5/06.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<RESPDATE>122805
<ARCHDATE>02262006
<CONTACT>John Penley, 256-955-3000
<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the Advanced Research Center (ARC) competition at the prime contractor level, and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those inte rested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level. The capability papers and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or team's ability to perform; that evaluatio n will be part of the formal source selection process. The Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command are seeking possible sources to perform High Performance Computing Research, Development and Acquisition and the operation s and maintenance (O&M) support of the equipment and systems at the Advanced Research Center (ARC) located in Huntsville, Alabama. The anticipated competition will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a period of performance of two years with four one-year options and/or award terms. It is anticipated that the requirements will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  The effort consists of operating and maintaining computing platforms rangin g from personal computers to high performance computers, auxiliary equipment such as storage media, high bandwidth communications equipment, multimedia communications equipment and all other equipment and facilities that form the ARC. Additionally, a contr actor must be able to perform space and missile defense-related systems analyses and provide recommendations to the government on approaches to conduct experiments, exercises, modeling and simulations. The contractor must also be able to demonstrate the ab ility to assume all Research, Development, Test and Evaluation and Operation and Maintenance functions as they exist at the time of the contract start. This may include in-progress customer tests, experiments, exercises, wargames and other customer program s as well as upgrade and modernization tasks involving facility, hardware, and software efforts. The contractor must have the ability to implement changes in the support provided since existing systems may be removed from service and new systems introduced  during the term of the contract. Some tests may require contractor personnel at remote sites. Due to uneven customer support requirements, the contractor should have the ability to provide qualified personnel to meet surge requirements. Firms that can mee t requirements set forth above are requested to provide a statement (not to exceed 10 pages) of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. Information shall be provided to the Contract Specialist  via e-mail to john.penley@sdmc.army.mil no later than 28 November, 2005 (20 days from issuance of the original Notice).  Firms responding should also state their company size and small business status, as well as their interest (i.e., as prime or subcontr actor). NAICS Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the  Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized  in FedBizOpps and available at the SMDC Website (http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/ARC.html).  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. The resultant contract will contain an org anizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC or MDA contracts.  To the greatest ext ent possible, while still protecting the Government's interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor's actual technical analysis performance. The Contractor must be able to obtain and retain a Top Secret  facility clearance. This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. A site visit of the ARC facility is anticipated and will be arranged at a later date. Original Point of Contact: John H. Penl ey, (256) 955-3000.  Email your questions to US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander at john.penley@smdc.army.mil; Place of Performance Address: Huntsville, Alabama, Postal Code: 35802, Country: US

<DESC>Contracting Office Address Chicago Office 9800 South Cass Avenue Argonne, IL  60439 Description The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Ames Laboratory (AMES) in Ames, Iowa.  AMES operates 330,000 gross square feet of government-owned buildings located on leased land on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.  The central mission of the Laboratory is to provide national scientific leadership and technological innovation to support DOEâ€™s objectives and programs. AMES serves DOE and the interests of science and national security by conducting fundamental research in the physical, chemical, biological, materials, mathematical and engineering sciences, environmental improvement, and other technical areas essential to national interests. AMES has a focus on materials research, with strengths in ancillary areas such as catalysis. Physical and chemical analytical capabilities support materials research. Current analytical capabilities are used to address environmental and molecular biological problems. AMES operates the Materials Preparation Center which provides capabilities in preparation, purification, fabrication and characterization of materials in support of R&D programs at government, academic and industry laboratories throughout the world. The Laboratoryâ€™s scientific component is organized into several research programs: Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences: to improve parallel computing through clustering techniques for use in scientific and engineering computation. Biorenewable Resource Consortium: development and utilization of agriculturally derived alternatives to petrochemicals and other nonrenewable fossil resources. Chemical and Biological Sciences: research on reactions in combustion and the nature of heterogeneous catalysis; research on new syntheses of inorganic catalytic materials; spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of metal oxide catalysts; and projects in separations, analytical spectroscopy, lasers in analytical chemistry, chemical analysis at liquid-solid interfaces, and metal hydride batteries. Condensed Matter Physics: neutron and x-ray scattering of condensed matter, including magnetic neutron scattering; design, discovery, growth and characterization of novel electronic and magnetic compounds; experimental studies of superconductivity, magnetism, and their coexistence in materials at low temperatures; development of techniques to create artificial macromolecular membranes and to determine their physical properties; and Photonic Band Gap structures (periodic dielectric structures that forbid propagation of electromagnetic waves in a certain frequency range). Environmental and Protection Sciences: technological solutions for the cleanup of  the legacy of nuclear weapons production; new forensic technologies. Materials Chemistry and Biomolecular Materials: to synthesize and to understand the principles governing properties and behavior of novel materials and structures, and macromolecular systems. Materials and Engineering Physics: fundamental understanding of materials phenomena at reduced dimensionality and increasing levels of compositional, structural, and functional complexities in magnetism, amorphous materials, solidification science, rare earth materials, and metallic liquid structures. Multiphase Systems: to advance understanding of three-dimensional gas-solid reacting flows using basic theory and modeling. Nondestructive Evaluation: research to develop flaw detection techniques for forecasting lifetimes under varied service conditions, and to meet needs for reliability in manufacturing materials and structures. In addition, AMES performs other non-DOE sponsored research that is consistent with DOEâ€™s and AMESâ€™ mission.  Through its technology transfer programs, industrial firms and other organizations benefit from AMESâ€™ technological knowledge through the increased competitiveness of U.S. industry in the international marketplace. Anticipated funding (from all sources) for fiscal year 2007 for AMES is approximately $30 million.  DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and will include a 60-day transition period.  The selected offeror will be expected to fully assume all management and operating responsibilities by January 1, 2007. All interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest to Lisa Rogers, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-06CH11358, at the following e-mail address: lisa.rogers@ch.doe.gov. While there is no specific format required, please reference the RFP number, list the name of a contact with a telephone number and an e-mail address, indicate your interest as being either a prime or a subcontractor, indicate whether you are a small business, and indicate if you are willing to have your expression of interest information published on the Source Evaluation Boardâ€™s solicitation website.  Submission of an Expression of Interest does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal.  Expressions of Interest should be received no later than 3:00p.m. Central Standard Time on December 2, 2005. Future information regarding this solicitation will be posted on DOEâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov.  DOE anticipates issuing a draft RFP in the second quarter of FY06.

Specifically, the goal of the market research is to identify companies which have either a mature close-in (down-looking) GPR system or the capabilities to rapidly mature such a GPR system to detect IEDs and AT m ines.  Maturity for this market research is defined as a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 or a clear path to demonstrate TRL 6 or higher within 12 months.  Results of this market research may be used to formulate a near term program that integ rates GPR technology onto a US Army ground vehicle.  This future program  may include the following Performance Objectives: detection of IEDs and AT mines on primary and secondary roads with a high probability of detection ( greater than or equal to 0.90) , and a low false alarm rate (less than or equal to 0.001 per square meter), with detection speeds of 8 to10 kilometers per hour; and the following Technical Objectives:  (a) Integration of an existing or modified (if needed) prototype detection system wit h a selected military vehicle to include an interface to be operated by an on-board soldier (b) Limited contractor performance and environmental testing of the prototype detection system to verify satisfaction of the performance objectives; and (c) Support  of limited testing by soldiers to verify suitability for production and deployment.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  Companies who desire to participate in this market research are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim  that it presently has the technology, qualifications and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys specific down-looking GPR system and performance test results,  docume ntation supporting a maturity level of TRL 6 or higher, or the approach to maturing the companys GPR technology to TRL 6 or higher within 12-months.  The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The whit e paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the CACW Contracting Officer, Peggy Melanson, at peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil by 5 December 2005.  The Government will consider all responses submitted on tim e.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SBA amends small business size standarde for its
<DESC>Effective Monday, November 14, 2005, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is temporarily amending the size eligibility criteria for loan assistance provided under the “Gulf Opportunity Pilot Loan Program,” a one-year pilot under the 7(a) Business Loan Program. The pilot program makes available on an expedited basis 7(a) loans to small businesses located in, locating to, or relocating in disaster areas declared by the President as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and any contiguous parishes or counties. This interim final rule makes financial assistance under the pilot program available to businesses that are considered small for the purpose of SBA’s 7(a) Business Loan Program and businesses considered small for the purpose of SBA’s Certified Development (CDC) Company Program. The CDC Program has an alternative size standard that states that eligible concerns have tangible net worth not in excess of $7 million, and average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding two completed fiscal years not in excess of $2.5 million. SBA prepared this rule as an interim final rule because its immediate implementation will facilitate the reconstruction and economic recovery of the Gulf Coast. 

Comments to the interim final rule are due by close of business December 14, 2005.

For more information, please go to http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#goloanIFR, where you can read and/or download the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on November 14, 2005. SBA has included is press release (in English and in Spanish) on the Gulf Opportunity Pilot Loan Program there as well.

<SUBJECT>R -- N/A
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Patrick J. Williams, under the authority of FAR 6.302 for an additional 65 hours of administrative support services for the National Institutes of Health, Office of Management, NIH Business System. 
The overall objective of the NIH Business System (NBS) is to facilitate the scientific mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and enable administrative and scientific support that is cost effective and provides accurate and timely information.  NIH will be unable to maintain its world-class structure in research without highly efficient and effective administrative support.  The NIH must have a business system that provides careful financial accounting and administrative data management and can quickly evolve to accommodate legislatively mandated changes in the government oversight.    The implementation of the new state-of-the-art process for managing key resources is crucial to the continued success of the NIH as an effective steward of the resources it has been allocated.  

Mr. Patrick Williams has provided expert contractual services to the NBS since the conception of the NBS project.  Mr. Williams has served as Executive Officer responsible for setting the initial direction for budget, personnel and administrative structure for the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the Director of Station Support Contracting for the Office of Procurement Management, OD, NIH.  As well as, responding to Departmental, Agency and congressional inquiries on contractual, administrative and programmatic issues.  Mr. Williams has established a strong working relationship with high-level scientific and administrative communities.  His efforts were working towards the HHS and NIH goals of developing processes and applications for monitoring and evaluating administrative systems which are cost effective and provide accurate and timely information.

Mr. Williams’ previous five and one half years of experience as NBS Project Manager for the ERP implementation have proven to be a critical component of the success of the ERP implementation.  Also his experience as a project manager with the NIH uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  He therefore, will not require orientation to the NIH management and related administrative issues. 

This requirement represents a continuation of the services he is currently providing to the NBS project during its transition to new management.  An additional 65 hours of service is proposed under the existing Purchase Order (MZ600004). Mr. Williams has an extensive knowledge of the NIH management and administrative issues.  He has the vast management knowledge of the type required by the NBS project.  It is determined that Mr. Williams is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints, Mr. Williams’ continued service is considered a crucial  component to the transition of management and the over success of the NBS project.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Air Superiority Target Request for Information
<DESC>Description:  

To assist the program office in developing the Phase I Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Air Superiority Target (AST), The Air Armament Center, Air-to-Air Missile Wing, Special Applications Group, Aerial Targets Directorate, Contracts Office, AAMSW/SASG/RTK, Eglin AFB FL invites industry to submit information on the Air Superiority Target (AST) acquisition.  The Government requests you review the draft AST Requirements Document and suggested format for all submissions.  The Government is especially interested in receiving cost and schedule rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates for completing the requirements.  

The primary mission of the AST will be to support Test and Evaluation (T&E) of air-to-air and surface-to-air munitions, T&E of aircraft missile warning and fire control systems, live-fire lethality testing, and to support Air Combat Command’s Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP).  The AST will have the performance and signature characteristics of anticipated threat fighter aircraft (year 2010 through 2025) and will include the capability to dispense threat-representative countermeasures including (but not necessarily limited to) chaff, flares, and Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) systems.   

The purpose of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is to investigate creative and unique concepts for meeting the requirements defined in the Air Superiority Target (AST) Requirements Document.  The AST will replace the current QF-4 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT).  The Government is interested in receiving and exploring information regarding a wide variety of solutions to include, but not limited to, existing retired/in-storage military aircraft, unmanned/combat air vehicles (UAVs/UCAVs); foreign aircraft, and new air vehicles.  The Government is also particularly interested in industry’s ideas for reducing the cost of ownership of aerial targets programs and thoughts/ideas regarding offerors providing target presentations to the Government (in lieu of providing only target airframes).  

A draft AST Requirements Document, dated 24 Oct 05, for the Air Superiority Target (AST) and supplemental technical information is available via the AST Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS) website.  Access to ATIMS can be obtained by submitting a current DD 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement with facility classification level annotated and the name, phone number, and E-mail address of the company representative who will be accessing the website to Ms. Crystal Judd, (850) 883-3476, crystal.judd@eglin.af.mil.  DD2345 certification and registration can be obtained from the Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC), Federal Center, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek MI 49016-3412 (telephone number is 1-800-352-3572).  Upon approval for access, instructions for accessing ATIMS will be sent to the designated company representative.  

The Government is requesting that all information package submittals be formatted in the following manner:  

A.  Summary Technical Concept- The summary technical concept shall include a description of how the proposed solution will meet the AST requirement. In addition, it should be limited to a maximum of 15 pages, and the first page should summarize, the proposed system capabilities.  The draft requirements document with suggested submission template is posted on ATIMS.
 
AST will be interoperable with two test ranges: Eglin Gulf Test Range (EGTR) and White Sands Missiles Range (WSMR).

B.  Schedule- The issuance of a competitive procurement for an AST System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program is anticipated to commence in FY08 with a projected production decision scheduled in FY12 with first production delivery 12 months after award.  If your concept involves concept development and technology development and cannot meet the SDD schedule, provide a realistic schedule leading to SDD award.  For planning purposes, the minimum production lot will be 12 targets per year, and the maximum production lot will be 36 targets per year. This section of the information submittal should address the schedule for development, test, and production in accordance to the above time constraints. The schedule should be limited to 5 pages.

C.  Cost-The cost section should include all anticipated contract costs for implementing the suggested concept(s)/program(s).   In addition, the contractor should include a description of all ground rules, assumptions, and significant risk areas.  The cost segment of the information submittal should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, and the first page should summarize the proposed cost areas.  The suggested submission template is posted on ATIMS, and the listed sub-set cost areas are not all inclusive but merely serve as guidance and reflect items of interest to the government.


D.  Relevant Past Experience-The relevant past experience section of the information submittal shall describe existing capabilities, manufacturing process, and teaming efforts with subcontractors.  In addition, information concerning the history of forecasting and controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), and commitment to customer satisfaction shall be included.  This section of the information submittal shall be limited to a maximum of 5 pages.

E.  Appendix-Supplemental Supporting Information to further explain your technical concept and capabilities may be included, but is not required, as an appendix and will not be counted in the page limitations. 

All information submittals shall be limited to unclassified data.  No classified information will be accepted.

A determination has been made that foreign participation will be prohibited.

Minimal use of proprietary data and markings is preferred.  The Government envisions that the information provided will be included in the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) final report.  If any proprietary data is included in the information package, it should be clearly marked as such.  

Interested parties capable of providing information for the above described requirements are invited to submit information packages no later than 3:00 p.m., CDT, on 20 January 2006 (earlier submittal is highly encouraged).  If using Federal Express, United Parcel Service, or if hand carrying, deliver to AAMSW/SASG/RTK, Building 11, 3rd Floor, Attn:  Ms. Crystal Judd, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Request for Information for REFM BCA
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RFI TIRNO-06-REFMBCA.  This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is NOT a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Response to this RFI will NOT serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently conducting a Business Case Analysis (BCA) to examine competitive sourcing alternatives for the Real Estate & Facilities Management (REFM) Program.  The IRS is interested in gaining further information through market research from service providers with relevant and sustained experience in real estate & facilities management.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain technical capability statements tailored to this request for the requirements outlined in the Request for Information Document as well as answers to a series of questions regarding service provider abilities to provide the service as described.  The requirements document provides the background and scope, instructions, description of the types of services performed, workload data and locations of the REFM program.  All interested service providers must respond as indicated in the Request for Information Document.  Service Providers should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary due to the fact that the IRS has a support commercial contractor assisting in the development of the Business Case Analysis.  Teaming arrangements, subcontracting and mentor protégé programs are encouraged.  Responses will also assist the Government in their market research to determine whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  Therefore, please identify your interest in either being a Prime or Sub-contractor for this requirement.  In order for the IRS to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses for points of contact, prime or sub-contractor interest, and identify the company as one or more of the following:  1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; 6) veteran-owned small business; 7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business or 8) large business.  

Service Provider responses and/or questions must be sent to the Contracting Officer, Debra M. Jacobs, at debra.jacobs@irs.gov.  Questions must be received by 5:00pm Thursday, November 17, 2005.  Official responses must be received by 5:00pm EST on Friday, December 16, 2005.  E-mail responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.   Solicitation Number 0152151 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under FAR Parts 12 and 13 to provide maintenance under the following SOW: 0001. The mission of the Operational Technology Division in the Federal Bureau of Investigation is to provide technical support for the field.  A significant part of this support is in the form of technical equipment.  A increasing portion of this equipment is designed and made inside the Rapid Prototyping Facility (RPF).  One of the tools that the RPF uses to fabricate new equipment is a Stereo-Lithography Apparatus (SLA).  The SLA takes information from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) system and automatically creates a dimensionally accurate, three-dimensional plastic model.  0002.  The RPF has three mechanical rapid prototyping systems. Two of these are a SLA-5000 and SLA Viper manufactured by 3D Systems, Inc.  A maintenance contract(s) is required for FY2006 to keep the systems running.  The estimated life of the machines are estimated at seven years from the original purchase.  0003.  Hardware Requirements:  1.0  The contractor(s) shall provide full hardware maintenance on the following hardware:  1.1  SLA 5000 and integral PC.  1.2 	SLA Viper and integral PC.  2.0 The contractor shall have "on call" remedial hardware maintenance.  2.1  The contractor shall respond within two hours as to when the remedial maintenance will be conducted.  2.2  The contractor shall provide this remedial hardware maintenance on-site within three working days of the acknowledgement. 3.0.  The contractor shall provide all spare parts under this contract. The contractor shall provide one laser replacement per machine at their expense as part of the contract.  If any additional lasers need to be replaced, the government will purchase the additional laser. 4.0 The contractor shall provide all current and revised test equipment during hardware maintenance. 5.0 The contractor shall provide preventative hardware maintenance at least every three months at the government site. The actual date for this maintenance will be scheduled at the government's convenience.  6.0 Security Clearances:  All contractor personnel performing maintenance work on site must complete the security processes and meet the requirements specified by the FBI Security Division for the sensitivity or classification level of the information for which they will require access.  Contractors coming on site shall be escorted at all times while at the on site location.  Contractors must possess a minimum of a Secret Personnel security clearance or be processed for a Limited background Investigation (LBI) before maintenance on site can be scheduled.

The FBI may consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror when in the best interest of the FBI.  The FBI also reserves the right not to make an award to any offeror.  References will be evaluated for acceptance prior to award. Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.

The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of all items provided to the government by the contractor.

5.  Periodic Adjustments of Performance Standards:
In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has found it not only advisable but necessary to adjust performance standards periodically.  That is because particular written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate services provider behaviors that act against achievement of the desired performance objectives.  Having learned that lesson, DCMA intends to apply it to this PBSO.  Accordingly, DCMA reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PBSO, up to and including the addition of entirely new performance standards and complete substitutions of new performance standards for those already existing in this PBSO or as may have been included by subsequent modifications of this document, at any time at the DCMA Information Technology Customer Service Organization’s (ITCSO’s) discretion—subject, of course, to the stipulations in the “Changes” clause of any resulting contract.  DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments more often than once each calendar quarter and in fact would prefer not to make them any more frequently than once each calendar year.       
6.  Places of Performance:
See Table 3.2.
7.  Period and Time of Performance:
Complete installation no later than 30 calendar days after the award date. 
Work periods are restricted to normal business hours (Monday through Friday, 0800-1700 local).  Work will not be performed on federal holidays as identified on http://www.opm.gov/fedhol/index.asp
8.  Travel:  
Travel expenses will not be reimbursed by the government.
9.  Security:  
The SP personnel assigned to the budget development and reporting will perform in an ADP II designated sensitive position due to the nature of the work performed.
Access to DCMA Information Technology (IT) unclassified systems/network is not authorized.  In accordance with the DoD5200.2R, Personnel Security Program Regulation, SP personnel performing services in Automated Data Processing (ADP) positions equivalent to the duties of duties equivalent to ADP-II or ADP-III positions shall be the subjects of a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check; however, for ADP II positions a NAC must be completed prior to performance on this contract.  DCMA security personnel will validate proof of existing favorably adjudicated investigations.  DCMA Security Office at 6350 Walker Lane, Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22310 will process new investigative requests.
When in DCMA-owned or controlled buildings or other facilities, SP personnel shall display DCMA-issued identification badges in accordance with the directions provided by this contract’s COTR.
10.  Invoicing Information: 
SPs shall submit invoices electronically via DoD’s Wide Area Workflow system.  The POC for WAWF is Ms. Alicia Allen 703 428-0887. (https://wawf.eb.mil/).

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate proposes to acquire on an other than full and open competition basis a program entitled, 'Advanced Helicopter Electromagnetics (AHE) Research'.  This research includes analysis and development of computatio nal tools for helicopter applications, development and improvements to Finite-Difference Time-Domain, Finite Element, Method of Moments, diffraction methods and hybrid techniques to predict the electromagnetic performance characteristics of antennas and se nsors on complex composite material vehicles/airframes. It is anticipated that a base year and 3 option years will be awarded.  A noncompetitive acquisition to Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona  85287-0103 is intended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1 )(b).  Arizona State is deemed to be the only responsible source.  No other known organization or university has compiled the extensive research data in the areas such as Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) modeling of complex metallic and non-metallic fu selage structures, rotor blade modulation analysis, helicopter antenna performance, antenna coupling, lightning effects, and EM wave penetration analysis for EM interference and effects on Rotorcraft. In addition no other known organization has the unique scale model helicopters developed for this type of research, testing and evaluation.  The costs that would be duplicated for another firm to acquire a similar capability are substantial.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be conside red by this agency.  This acquisition will be conducted using Alpha Contracting techniques; therefore a formal solicitation for this program will not be issued.  Any questions in regard to this announcement must be submitted in writing, via fax, postal mai l to the addresss shown above; fax (757)878-0008, or email no later than 16 December 2005, 2:00 pm EST to kenneth.m.hood@us.army.mil.
