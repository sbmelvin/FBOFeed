<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, on behalf of PM Soldier Weapons, intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source modification to Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace (KDA) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B) & FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement regarding Spare Parts and Depot Support for the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) provided by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace.  The anticipated effort will be a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Modification to Contract # W15QKN-07-D-0018 that will increase the ceiling by $85M. The increased demand for deliveries of Spare Parts in 4QFY12 and Depot Support needed to begin 3QFY12 to sustain the higher number of deployed systems can only be met by KDA.
 
The acquisition of CROWS Spare Parts and Depot Support from sources other than Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace will not meet the schedule requirements.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in meeting PM SWs requirements as a result of the unacceptable lead times from contract award to the services rendered. The potential new source would have to manufacture CROWS spares that would function both reliably and safely and have a Government qualified depot to perform these system repairs.  Failure to meet this timeline will result in a break in the supply of spare parts, an increased risk of not being able to sustain deployed CROWS systems, and consequently, detrimental impacts to mission readiness and Warfighters safety.  KDA is the only source able to meet the Government's CROWS spares and depot support requirements without disclosing KDA's proprietary design.  Please note this notice DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated award date for this action is the 30th of May 2012.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space FlightCenter is releasing a FY12 Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) Broad AgencyAnnouncement (BAA) in support of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). The BAA will beavailable on or about February 1, 2012, by opening the NASA Research Opportunitieshomepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/      and then linking through the menu listingsSolicitations to Open Solicitations. The Government does not intend to acquire acommercial item using FAR Part 12. This announcement solicits proposals for the demonstration of space technologies thatprovide new system-level technological capabilities. OCT TDM is seeking to identifycandidate crosscutting, system-level technologies to be demonstrated in the relevantenvironment such as ground, air, suborbital or orbital regimes. A key requirement in thisprogram is that the technology under consideration must clearly be crosscutting.Crosscutting is defined as a technology with potential to benefit more than one customer,where a customer can be a NASA Mission Directorate, another government agency, academia,or the aerospace industry. Specifically, system-level technologies implies anintegrated system with mission capability and not component-level demonstrations. OCT isseeking new capability demonstrations that advance the technology readiness of theselected systems, provide tangible, innovative technology products, are cost effective,and capture significant public interest and awareness. The candidate technology must bemature, at least Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 at the time of the proposalsubmission and the proposed demonstration must raise the technology readiness of the newcapability to TRL 7 or higher, such that it may be infused into the critical path forfuture missions. This announcement solicits technology demonstration proposals in the following focusedtechnology area:Demonstrations of Propulsion Systems Utilizing Green Propellant Alternatives toHydrazine: Utilization of hydrazine fuel for rockets, satellites, and spacecraft is pervasive.Hydrazine systems are used extensively for primary and reaction control in-spacepropulsion applications, as well as for power and reaction control for launch vehicles.Efficient propulsive performance and long duration storage attributes have made the useof hydrazine widespread across the aerospace community. However, hydrazine is highlycorrosive and toxic, creating a need for non-toxic, high performance propellants forNASA, DoD, academia, and the commercial space industry. Propellants that greatly reducethe handling hazards of hydrazine have been under development for many years and havebeen termed green propellants, a general name for a family of propellants (liquid,solid, mono- or bi-propellants, hybrids) which offer safer handling conditions and lowerenvironmental impact. Beyond decreasing environmental hazards and pollutants, promisingaspects of green propellants also include reduced systems complexity, fewer operationalhazards, and decreased launch processing times  while increasing propellant performance.The utilization of green propellants also promises benefits in terms of overall lifecycle cost reduction, contributing to lower costs of access to space. Research anddevelopment in the U.S. and Europe has produced several new green propellant candidatesthat show tremendous promise. This topic area solicits demonstrations of fullyintegrated, system-level propulsive and power generation capabilities utilizing lesstoxic, easier to handle propellant alternatives to hydrazine. Demonstrations of ahydrazine monopropellant alternative application in at least one of the followingclasses: in-space RCS, in-space primary propulsion, launch vehicle RCS or launch vehiclepower generation are desired. Consideration of more than one application as part of theproposal is desired. The proposal may also include bipropellant applications as a growthof the base monopropellant system, demonstrating a higher ISP hybrid capability.Demonstrations of complete propulsion and power generation systems including such itemsas engines, tanks, valves, injectors, thrust chambers, feed and control systems aredesired. Demonstrations may include one or more thrust and/or power generation classes.Proposals should include the design development, characterization, testing, analyses thatvalidate the characteristics and performance in terms of: ISP; volume ISP; ignitionreliability; flame stability; throttle ability and restart ability; operationsreliability across a range of system pressure and temperature conditions; propellant andsystem processing, handling and operational safety; hazard and toxicity; and componentand system life duration.   The anticipated release date of the BAA is on or about February 1, 2012. Proposals shallbe submitted electronically, and all proposers shall use NASAs proposal data system,NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com	 ). In addition, the electronic proposals must besubmitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Participation is opento all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry,nonprofit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs),University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASACenters, and other Government agencies. Every organization that intends to submit aproposal in response to this BAA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registrationmust identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit theelectronic proposal. Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to accessthe electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) tofamiliarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information.

<RESPDATE>030212
<CONTACT>Laurie A Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov - Annette Carter, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-5916, Email cartera@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis the continuation of support for the Neuro-QOL contract with the Northwestern University for "Neuro-QOL: Interim Sustainability and Training."</p>
<p>The primary continuing goals of the contract are to design and develop a web-based platform that will allow researchers or clinicians to create study-specific web-based data collection pages; will include all Neuro-QOL short forms as well as instruments that include Computer Adaptive Testing for administration to research participants; will provide for scoring and exporting of data; and will provide technical support and consultation to researchers on the use of Neuro-QOL instruments, including data collection and data export functions. In addition, the contractor will be required to conduct 2 to 3 training sessions/workshops to introduce researchers to the development, methodology, and use of Neuro-QOL, provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research. Training sessions may be conducted locally or in conjunction with existing scientific meetings in order to encourage participation. We anticipate that this will be a one-year undertaking to complete all requirements.<br />Over the initial 6 year contract, the Northwestern University, (under a subcontract to NorthShore University HealthCare Research Institute), developed, tested, and completed initial validation of the required instruments. Given that Northwestern University has performed all the work in development of the Neuro-QOL deliverable, there is no reasonable alternative but to award a sole-source acquisition of this interim service. Although there may be other potential sources that would have the technical ability to serve this function, they would not be able to provide the scientific and technical expertise specific to this requirement, including providing consultation and training on the development, implementation, and interpretation of the Neuro-QOL instruments. The NINDS believes that the Northwestern University is the only source available with the knowledge and capability to develop the interim web-based platform and provide the requisite training and consultation to support access, implementation, and maintenance of the Neuro-QOL.</p>
<p>The specific approach to long-term sustainability of Neuro-QOL will be determined by NINDS over the next year. Until full implementation of a future plan is accomplished, it is essential to make Neuro-QOL available to the research community for two primary reasons: 1) to avoid protracted delay in incorporation of the Neuro-QOL measures into applicable clinical research projects, and 2) to provide a period of time for interested potential sources to have an opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the structure of the Neuro-QOL platform so they may participant in a possible future competition for funding to maintain Neuro-QOL should the government opt to pursue such competition.</p>
<p>Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, quotation or capability statement which shall be considered by the NINDS. The determination by the Government not to compete the new contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority: 45 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201e.   This is not a solicitation for proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>Chemical Biological Medical Systems - Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (CBMS-JVAP) is the DoD organization responsible for developing, producing and stockpiling FDA-licensed vaccine systems to protect the Warfighter from biological agents. The current CBMS-JVAP portfolio includes vaccines at varying stages of clinical development in addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines. <br><br>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br><br>CBMS-JVAP has a new requirement for a pre-exposure prophylaxis multivalent equine encephalitis vaccine that provides balanced onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals.  The multivalent equine encephalitis vaccine must provide broad spectrum protection against exposure to Venezuelan, eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses.   Because the incidence of natural occurrence is low, this vaccine will likely be developed under the Animal Rule. <br><br>The primary objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in determining a suitable contract solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a high standard for CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, manufacture, and production to meet DoD's objectives. <br><br>CBMS-JVAP is seeking companies with a vaccine candidate to protect against exposure to multiple species of equine encephalitis viruses.  This includes both companies that own or have access to Intellectual property (IP) and companies that do not own or have access to IP.  <br><br>As such, the Government is researching information on current industry capabilities and interest via responses to the questions below:<br>A.Describe your company's current vaccine candidate under development expected to achieve FDA licensure. <br>    1.What is the current stage of development?  <br>    2.Include explanation of product type.  Examples include small molecule    therapeutic, large molecule therapeutic, vaccine, etc.<br>    3.Specifically describe your nonclinical (animal studies), manufacturing and clinical progress.<br>B.Please explain the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your candidate base on the attached TRL definitions. <br>C.As these candidates will likely be developed under the Animal Rule, what animal species, if any, have been selected and/or used?  Has the FDA accepted the species used to support the Animal Rule?<br>D.Does your company own or have a license to intellectual property (IP) related to a multivalent equine encephalitis vaccine?  If so, please describe the state of your company's rights to the IP.  If your company is not a manufacturer, how do you intend to manufacture the product? <br>E.Describe your company's manufacturing capabilities.  Are the vaccine candidates manufactured in house or subcontracted?  Does your company oppose technology transfer to a DoD funded advanced manufacturing facility?<br>F.Indicate company business size (based on the NAICS size standard), business status (i.e., large business, small business, disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.), and date of incorporation.<br> <br>In addition to providing the information requested above, respondents are invited to provide materials explaining their capabilities to fulfill the CBRN prophylactic requirement specified above, including: a description of their candidate which clearly supports its prophylactic potential; specific capabilities related to the development of the candidate; program management structure; and intellectual property availability. Respondents should indicate if their level of interest is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br><br>Questions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to the CBMS e-mail address listed below within 5 days after RFI release.   <br><br>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br>All written responses must be received within thirty (30) days of issuance of this RFI.

No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>Chemical Biological Medical Systems - Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (CBMS-JVAP) is the DoD organization responsible for developing, producing and stockpiling FDA-licensed vaccine systems to protect the Warfighter from biological agents. The current CBMS-JVAP portfolio includes vaccines at varying stages of clinical development in addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines. <br><br>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br><br>CBMS-JVAP has a new requirement for a pre-exposure prophylaxis ricin vaccine that provides balanced onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals.  Because the incidence of natural occurrence is low, this vaccine will likely be developed under the Animal Rule. <br><br>The primary objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in determining a suitable contract solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a high standard for CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, manufacture, and production to meet DoD's objectives. <br><br>CBMS-JVAP is seeking companies with a vaccine candidate to protect against exposure to ricin toxin.  This includes both companies that own or have access to Intellectual property (IP) and companies that do not own or have access to IP.  <br><br>As such, the Government is researching information on current industry capabilities and interest via responses to the questions below:<br>A. Describe your company's current vaccine candidate under development expected to achieve FDA licensure. <br>1. What is the current stage of development?  <br>2. Include explanation of product type.  Examples include small molecule therapeutic, large molecule therapeutic, vaccine, etc.<br>3. Specifically describe your nonclinical (animal studies), manufacturing and clinical progress.<br>B. Please explain the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your candidate based on the attached TRL definitions. <br>C. As these candidates will likely be developed under the Animal Rule, what animal species, if any, have been selected and/or used?  Has the FDA accepted the species used to support the Animal Rule?<br>D. Does your company own or have a license to intellectual property (IP) related to a ricin vaccine?  If so, please describe the state of your company's rights to the IP.  If your company is not a manufacturer, how do you intend to enable another party to manufacture the product? <br>E. Describe your company's manufacturing capabilities.  Are the vaccine candidates manufactured in house or subcontracted?  Does your company oppose technology transfer to a DoD funded advanced manufacturing facility?<br>F. Indicate company business size (based on the NAICS size standard), business status (i.e., large business, small business, disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.), and date of incorporation.<br> <br>In addition to providing the information requested above, respondents are invited to provide materials explaining their capabilities to fulfill the CBRN prophylactic requirement specified above, including: a description of their candidate which clearly supports its prophylactic potential; specific capabilities related to the development of the candidate; program management structure; and intellectual property availability. Respondents should indicate if their level of interest is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br><br>Questions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to the CBMS e-mail address listed below within 5 days after RFI release.   <br><br>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br>All written responses must be received within thirty (30) days of issuance of this RFI.

It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposals or as a solicitation to do business with the Government.<br />A. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION<br />The Air Force Safety Center's (AFSC) Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Safety Branch is tasked with providing RPA safety policy, global mishap prevention strategies and processes. The program provides Air Force-wide RPA safety strategies, develops RPA safety policy, and conducts RPA mishap investigation analysis and research, and resources safety expertise for key issues including integration into the National Airspace System. This program is necessary to safely integrate RPAs into war fighter operations in response to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF)-directed establishment of 65 Combat Air Patrols (CAPs); Continental United States (CONUS) humanitarian assistance and homeland security; to include crucial support to Combat Commanders in the mishap investigation and prevention processes. The offeror shall provide a full range A&amp;AS services to AFSC/SEF in efforts to implement AF and AF/SE strategy to provide functional safety capabilities in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) missions; to address Air Force Central Command AFCENT Commander (CC) and Commander of Air Combat Command (COMACC) request to clear RPA investigative backlog, and to facilitate the safe expansion of RPA operations within the National Airspace System, and OIF/OEF AORs.

BASIC INFORMATION<br />A services, performance-based type contract with a period of performance of one-year basic effort with two one-year options is anticipated. This effort is anticipated to be less than $5M total. Potential sources are being sought who can provide the requirements established in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), either in-house or through prospective subcontractors. Contract Teaming Arrangements are desirable if they offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost and delivery. The affiliation rule allows a small business set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams (small business as prime contractor with small and large business subcontractors) when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. Based upon the evaluation of the responses, the Government reserves the right to set-aside this acquisition for a small business program. Foreign-owned firms are advised they will not be allowed to participate at the prime contractor level.<br />C. STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES INSTRUCTIONS<br />Interested/qualified offerors who can provide the requirements in accordance with Section A above are invited to submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC is limited to 7 pages (12 pitch or larger), single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inch pages. The SOCs should also provide the following information:
<p>1) Explicitly provide labor category titles and demonstrate capabilities, subject matter experts and past 5 years experience and expertise to satisfy the requirements listed in the attached Summary of Required Services. Provide the percentage of subcontracting required per core competencies to fulfill these requirements. The description of capabilities and experience must be segregated under labor category titles which correspond directly with the labor categories listed in the Summary of Required Services.<br />2) Company information should include the following a. Company's name, point of contact, address, email addresses, phone and FAX numbers, and the company's website address (if applicable); b. identification of business size in relation to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code (i.e., US large or small business); d.

<RESPDATE>022512
<ARCHDATE>03112012
<CONTACT>Tye White, 202-267-5751

<a href="mailto:tye.l.white@faa.gov">tye.l.white@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this Request for Offer (RFO) for an Enterprise Messaging System (EMS) through a Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Solution.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.11, Public Announcements.
Description of Required Services:
The FAA's current messaging system is a client-server based solution that uses the IBM Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino product lines. Other DOT organizations use Microsoft Exchange.  Support for the FAA is provided under a ten-year contract, currently operating under negotiated extensions.  In conducting its budget, business case, and requirements analyses, the FAA has determined that the traditional client-server approach to its current messaging system does not meet the need to access any data, anywhere, anytime, using any device, in the most cost effective way.  As a result, the FAA is addressing this challenge with its first entry into the cloud by transitioning to a seamless enterprise-wide commercially available cloud messaging service for approximately 80,000 users (about 60,000 FAA users; 20,000 other DOT users).  This first entry point into the cloud will be carried out through a phased approach to assure smooth transitions from a current infrastructure environment to cloud services.  Other additional services, as described in this SOO, will be considered within this context.
Nature of the Procurement: 
This is a full and open competition in which the FAA will evaluate proposals in accordance with the provisions of Section M of the RFO.  Small Business entities must meet the size standard for the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210, "Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services" with a SBA size standard of $25 million for this solicitation.  The FAA is contemplating award of a single contract for a period of performance of seven years (one year base period and six one-year option periods).  
NAICS Code:
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services with a size standard of $25 Million.
All interested sources are referred to the attached RFO.  All proposals submitted in response to this RFO must be addressed to the attention of John Gamble and Tye White, and reference the RFO Number DTFAWA-11-R-00043.  Proposals must be delivered to the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationBuilding 10A, Suite 406	800 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C.  20591
The date and time for receipt of proposals is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, February 20, 2012 (facsimile and email responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals for Submittals.  Proposal submissions must be in accordance with Section L of the SIR/RFO.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.
Questions regarding this RFO must be submitted via email to John Gamble, Contracting Officer, at john.gamble@faa.gov, with c.c. to Tye White at tye.white@faa.gov..  In order to finalize responses and provide to offerors prior to submission of proposals, questions will no longer be accepted after close of business February 13, 2012, 3:00 p.m. Eastern 
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this RFO.  This is a request for competitive proposals and will result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island is hosting a pre-proposal conference for solicitation W52P1J-11-R-0017 for the M142 Firing Device, NSN: 1375-01-040-1526, posted to FedBizOps on 17 Jan 12.  The main emphasis of this pre-proposal conference is to discuss a new quality clause in this Request for Proposal (RFP), "Process Capability, Control, and Improvement Requirements," (PCCI) local clause number 52.246-4017, dated May 2011.  The intent of the PCCI clause is to eventually replace the current quality clause entitled, "Statistical Process Control," (SPC) local clause number 52.246-4506, dated Mar 2006 as a superior method of process control.  Both the PCCI and SPC clauses are included in the RFP, but the resultant contract will only be awarded with either the PCCI or SPC clause (with corresponding data requirements), but will not include both.  The RFP requires separate pricing for SPC clause implementation or PCCI clause implementation on the required price matrix.<br>The pre-proposal conference will be held on Wednesday, 01 February 2012 starting 9:00 am CST, at Rock Island Arsenal, IL, Building 350, 6th Floor, Wheeler Conference Center.  The pre-proposal conference will provide an overview of important aspects of the RFP, address offeror questions to date; and provide an overview, methodology, and training for the new PCCI clause.  The pre-proposal conference will also provide opportunity for one-on-one sessions between the Government and potential offerors.  The Government requests that all questions pertaining to this RFP, as practical, be submitted no later than 25 January 2012 for the Government to address at this conference.  All Contractor attendees must be U.S. Citizens and must be pre-registered for visitor access to the Rock Island Arsenal.  All visitors will be required to present a valid photo ID for entrance.  The following information for each attendee must be submitted to the POC below, no later then 27 Jan 2012:<br>Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, and Contractor Name<br>Any response to this notice should reference the following:  W52P1J-11-R-0017:  M142 Pre-Proposal Conference.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br><br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by PEO, EIS, Technology Applications Office in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. PEO, EIS, Technology Applications Office is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as described below. Those not able to provide all preferred features are still encouraged to submit information on the features currently available in their products and propose an applicable schedule, for those features that are planned for the future. <br><br>The intent of this RFI is to understand what products are or will be available in the High Definition (HD) video encoder market in a small form factor suitable for installation in space limited or mobile locations.  As video source systems become more complex and user needs and capabilities become more disparate, there is a need to develop network centric and convenient means to meet different objectives.  An HD video encoder offers a partial solution to the problem.  In the example below, a typical encoder scenario is described.  <br><br>An HD video encoder ingests an HD-SDI raw video stream from an HD video sensor.  The HD-SDI video stream carries a 1280x720p, 30fps video signal with MISB STD 0601-compliant KLV metadata embedded in the VANC.  No audio is present.  The encoder produces two UDP multicast MPEG-2 TS streams each comprising an H.264 and KLV elementary stream.  One MPEG-2 TS stream contains 720x480p, 30fps video at 1.3 Mbps and the other contains 1280x720p, 30fps video at 6 Mbps.  Each stream contains the same KLV metadata elementary stream, and other MPEG-2 TS control signals.  Latency due to the encode process is less than 250ms. Loss of video interpretability or intelligence is no greater than one V-NIIRS level at the lower rate encoded stream.  The video content will include scenarios such as areas of interest loitering, dismounts, and vehicle tracking. <br><br>Interested parties shall respond, and describe existing or near-term mature (next 30 days) capabilities, estimated costs, features or products that meet or exceed those in the aforementioned scenario. Respondents are encouraged to describe additional features and capabilities supported by their solutions.  A written response shall address which of the following list of capabilities are supported and describe the vendor's approach, support, and limitations for these capabilities and any unique or special variations or extensions to these capabilities.  <br><br>1)	Interfaces<br>a)	Video:  <br>i)	Composite (NSTC/PAL) (Threshold)<br>ii)	SD-SDI (SMPTE 259M) (T)<br>iii)	HD-SDI (SMPTE 292M) (T)<br>iv)	3G-SDI (SMPTE 424M) (T)<br>v)	HDMI (O)<br>vi)	ASI (O)<br>vii)	1 Input (T)/2 Inputs (Objective)<br>b)	Serial Data <br>i)	RJ-45 RS-232 Serial for Cursor on Target (CoT)  or KLV metadata<br>ii)	RJ-45 RS-232 Serial for Management<br>iii)	Number of Interfaces:  1 (T)/2 (O)<br>c)	Ethernet<br>i)	RJ-45 10/100/1000 Mbps Base-T for streaming<br>ii)	RJ-45 10/100/1000 Mbps Base-T for management<br>iii)	Autodect/Half/Full Duplex<br>d)	Power<br>i)	With locking interface<br>2)	Video Encoding<br>a)	H.264 (ISO/IEC 14496-10 AVC MPEG-4 part 10)<br>i)	Baseline Profile<br>ii)	Main Profile<br>b)	GOP:  1 - 300, infinite<br>c)	Frame Rate:  10 - 60 fps (T)/1 - 60 fps (O)<br>d)	Video Resolutions<br>i)	Input<br>(1)	720x480i 59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(2)	720x576i 50Hz<br>(3)	720x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(4)	720x576p 25Hz/50Hz<br>(5)	1280x720p 29.97Hz/30Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(6)	1920x1080i 50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(7)	1920x1080p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>ii)	Output<br>(1)	352x240p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(2)	360x262p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(3)	360x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(4)	360x576p 25Hz<br>(5)	720x480i/ 59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(6)	720x576i 50Hz<br>(7)	720x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(8)	720x576p 25Hz<br>(9)	1280x720p 29.97Hz/30Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(10)	1920x1080i 50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(11)	1920x1080p 24 Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>iii)	Conversion<br>(1)	720p   260x262p<br>(2)	720p   360x480p<br>(3)	720p   720x480p<br>(4)	1080p  720x 480p<br>(5)	1080p   720p<br>e)	Bit Rate:  100 kbps - 20 Mbps <br>f)	Bit Rate Regulation:  ABR (T)/CBR, VBR (O)<br>g)	Quantization Floor Adjustment:  6 - 52<br>h)	Input/Output <br>i)	1 input to 2 independent output streams (T)<br>ii)	2 inputs each to  2 independent output streams (O)<br>i)	Latency: <br>i)	< 250 ms @ 24 - 30 fps<br>ii)	<150 ms @ 50 - 60 fps<br>3)	Metadata Input<br>a)	Encoding:  CoT, KLV (MISB Compliant)<br>b)	Transport Protocols:<br>i)	CoT:  Serial (RS-232), IP<br>ii)	KLV:  Serial (RS-232), IP, VANC<br>c)	CoT to KLV conversion (O)  <br>4)	Network Protocols<br>a)	Streaming<br>i)	MPEG-2 Transport Stream (SPTS) ISO\IEC 13818<br>(1)	1 - 7 TS packets/IP packet<br>(2)	Adjustable MTU size<br>ii)	UDP, RTP, Multicast, Unicast<br>iii)	Channel announcement via SAP<br>b)	Access:  UDP, RTP, IGMP, SNMP, HTTP<br>5)	Management<br>a)	Command/Telnet (T)<br>b)	Web Browser GUI (O)<br>c)	Logging<br>d)	Status Indicators<br>6)	Physical<br>a)	Size:  < One quarter of standard 1 RU 19" Rack space<br>b)	Power:  100-240 VAC, < 20W<br>c)	Weight:  < 5 lbs<br>7)	Environmental<br>a)	Operating Temperature:  0  - 70  C<br>b)	Relative Humidity: 5% - 95%<br>c)	EMC:  FCC part 15 class B and CE<br>8)	Security:  AES 256/128 bit encryption (O)<br>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).

Questions received in response to the draft RFPs will be discussed during the Q&A portion at the pre-solicitation conference.<br><br><br>Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW):<br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a JSEW that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment, such as weapon system optics and electronic equipment, in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination.  The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination, supporting thorough decontamination of sensitive equipment without adversely impacting the operational life or performance of the target assets. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the JSEW by basing the design on the maturation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products is central to the acquisition strategy.  An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, is intended to provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the JSEW into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS). The JSEW is considered to be a stand-alone capability.<br><br>Proposed products will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or stimulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and Blister-H. <br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with sensitive equipment, as defined in the JSEW Performance Specifications.  <br><br><br>General Purpose Decontaminant(s) (GPD):<br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a GPD that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons, in hostile and non-hostile environments, that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination thereby reducing health risk to friendly forces and non-combatants from CBRN contaminated assets.  In addition, it is desired that GPD also provide an immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, will provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the GPD into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  The GPD is considered to be a stand-alone capability.   <br><br>Proposed decontaminants will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and/or Blister-H; and/or biological efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) against bacterial endospores, vegetative bacteria, and viruses.<br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with equipment, as defined in the GPD Performance Specification.  <br><br>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  No solicitation exists at this time.  <br>

<DESC>The Cherry Point Satellite Contracting Office, Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Cherry Point, NC 28533 hereby gives notice of their intent to award a contract to Retrotech, Inc, Post Office Box 586 Fishers, New York, 14453, (Cage Code: 0MAZ2) on a sole source basis in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement for the replacement of three (3) Automated Storage and Retrieval Machines (ASRM).  Market research has determined that Retrotech is the only source capable of providing the required items.
  Therefore, the government intends to procure these products on a sole source basis from Retrotech, Inc.  

The new ASRMs must interface with the existing Material Handling Equipment (MHE) and the NAVAIR corporate Automated Storage Kitting and Retrieval System (ASKARS).  Retrotech is the original manufacturer (OEM) of the system and therefore owns the proprietary data rights to the software.  Replacement of the ASRMs will necessitate changes to the Storage Retrieval Machine (SRM), conveyor Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the storage subsystem's SubSystem Controller (SSC) programs and operations.  Retrotech, Inc. is the only company that can provide the required SSC software interface between the new equipment, the MHE and the NAVAIR corporate ASKARS application.
  The SSC provides and controls the automated operation of the MHE based on container/pallet movement requests received through its interface with ASKARS.  The SSC must be 100% compatible with the ASKARS application and the other SSCs already operating varying Automated Storage/Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) at FRC East.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. However, all quotes received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered.  Interested parties may identify their interest and unique capabilities to respond to this requirement or submit their quote. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Point of contact for this requirement is John DiJoseph (primary), 252.466.2786, john.dijoseph@usmc.mil or Sherry Kelly (secondary), 252.466.2846, sherry.kelly@usmc.mil.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.com</span>. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Central Registration database </span>and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.com </span>is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. </span></p>

<p><br />Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items</p>
<p>As prescribed in FAR 12.302(d) the following addendum is provided for solicitation provision FAR 52.212-1 and hereby amends any language therein:</p>

<p>A. To assure the timely and equitable evaluation of quotations, vendors must follow the instructions contained herein.

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above as well as meet the requirements in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1). Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />ii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>52.252-1 -- Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference.</p>
<p>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

POC for Questions is SSG Regina Lawrence.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, award will be made to a vendor that is able to provide a HP ProLiant ML350. The HP ProLiant ML350 has been shown to work effectively with the information assurance software. Also, a considerable amount of time and expense has been invested in developing a monitoring and supporting infrastructure around the servers currently in production. A new infrastructure would need to be researched, purchased and implemented in the event that another vendor's servers were introduced into the environment. For instance, the server hardware is proactively monitored by HP Systems Insight Manager (SIM) using agents specific to HP hardware that is installed on each of the servers. SIM agents are not available for other brands of servers. In order for a test environment to be successful, it should as closely mirror the production environment as possible. Switching to a different vendor would present potential problems to production migration cycle by introducing a new device drivers and management software.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>Project Title:
<p>Backup Electricity Generator Replacement - CBP Turner, Montana Residences</p>
<p><br />Project Location:</p>
<p>The Turner, Montana Land Port of Entry north of Turner, Montana at the U.S./Canadian border on Turner Road, State Highway 241. The residences are known locally as units MTIM21 and MTIM22. The two residences are vinyl siding, three bedroom, 1,374 SF, ranch manufactured homes with basements and attached garages.</p>
<p><br />Project Background:</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates the Land Port of Entry (LPOE) north of Turner, Montana. There are two U.S. Federal Government owned houses adjacent to this LPOE that are rented by LPOE staff. These houses have one existing automatic standby/backup generator that provides electrical power to the houses in cases of power failure. The existing generator requires significant repairs that would cost more than the generator's residual value. Therefore, this project will include the complete demolition, removal and proper disposal of the existing failed generator and the complete delivery, installation and testing of two new automatic, standby/backup generators - one generator for each house.</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is a U.S. Federal Government agency that provides supply and building services to other U.S. Federal Government agencies. For this project, the "Customer Agency" is CBP and GSA is the service provider.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and the PBPL Availability Project Manager, The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>This solicitation is modified to answer questions that have been asked and to include an offer checklist.&nbsp; <br /><br />Added Jan 18, 2012<br /><br />THE SOLICITATION CLOSE DATE AND TIME IS EXTENDED TO 01 FEBRUARY 2012 AT 4:30 PM EST.</strong></p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>The Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages the implementation of OTI country programs. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Field Programs Division regularly engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened. For those Contractors who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be</strong></span> traveling with someone who already has base access, please get the information requested in the Pre-Proposal Conference Announcement Packet (Guest Name, Drivers License #, State of Issue, and Date of Birth) to Samuel McDuffey, <a href="mailto:Samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil">samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2011</strong></span>.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command -Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby issues a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in advance of the Pre-solicitation Conference for the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) scheduled to be held on 16 November 2011. This is a draft RFP made available for comment prior to the Pre-solicitation Conference.  This is not a solicitation and no proposals are requested at this time.<br><br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a JSEW that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment, such as weapon system optics and electronic equipment, in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination. The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination, supporting thorough decontamination of sensitive equipment without adversely impacting the operational life or performance of the target assets. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the JSEW by basing the design on the maturation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products is central to the acquisition strategy. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, is intended to provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the JSEW into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS). The JSEW is considered to be a stand-alone capability.<br><br>Proposed products will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or stimulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and Blister-H. <br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with sensitive equipment, as defined in the JSEW Performance Specifications.<br><br>The draft RFP and associated attachments can be accessed from the solicitation link on this page or can be downloaded from the Natick Contracting Division website link below.  This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.<br><br>The announcement number W911QY-12-R-0006 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this Draft RFP. <br><br>The Government has announced a pre-solicitation conference for interested parties on 16 November 2011.  Questions received at least three (3) business days prior to the pre-solicitation conference will be addressed during the conference.  The full announcement for the pre-proposal conference and registration information is available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-12-R-0006.<br><br>Questions regarding this Draft RFP will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.greenwood@us.army.mil with a courtesy to peter.wallace@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command -Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby notifies industry at large and parties interested in the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) W911QY-12-R-0006 of a change in contracting strategy for this program. The forthcoming solicitation for this item shall be in the form of a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation RFP IAW FAR 12.603. This change is in response to industry concerns regarding the complexity of the draft RFP, which is hereby withdrawn.   W911QY-12-R-0006 will continue to be the controlling document number and any further information/documentation concerning this acquisition shall be issued under W911QY-12-R-0006 on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) and the Natick Contracting Division website (http://www3.natick.army.mil). This is an announcement of a change in acquisition strategy only and no proposals are requested at this time.<br><br>The Government's revised contracting strategy for JSEW is to issue a series of Orders for Commercial Items (Standard Form1449 using simplified acquisition procedures.  These Orders for Commercial Items  will be for similar quantities and sequence to those outlined in the JSEW test program schedule presented during the JSEW Industry Day, beginning with a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure 870  JSEWs for the first Competitive Prototype testing phase (CP I) of this program.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The intent of this acquisition effort is to acquire and test promising commercial items against specific evaluation criteria with the ultimate intent to procure and field a JSEW that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment, such as weapon system optics and electronic equipment, and non-sensitive equipment, such as vehicles, hard shelters, material handling equipment, and individual equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination. The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination, supporting thorough decontamination of sensitive and non-sensitive equipment without adversely impacting the operational life or performance of the target assets. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the JSEW by basing the design on the maturation of Commercial Items products is central to the acquisition strategy.  <br><br>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.  The announcement number W911QY-12-R-0006 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this announcement or any Draft RFP. <br><br>Questions regarding this announcement will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.greenwood@us.army.mil with a courtesy to peter.wallace@us.army.mil and shall be posted in a non-attribution basis to the Federal Business Opportunities and Natick Contracting Division websites.<br>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201e.   This is not a solicitation for proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>Chemical Biological Medical Systems - Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (CBMS-JVAP) is the DoD organization responsible for developing, producing and stockpiling FDA-licensed vaccine systems to protect the Warfighter from biological agents. The current CBMS-JVAP portfolio includes vaccines at varying stages of clinical development in addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines. <br><br>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br><br>CBMS-JVAP has a new requirement for a pre-exposure prophylaxis ricin vaccine that provides balanced onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals.  Because the incidence of natural occurrence is low, this vaccine will likely be developed under the Animal Rule. <br><br>The primary objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in determining a suitable contract solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a high standard for CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, manufacture, and production to meet DoD's objectives. <br><br>CBMS-JVAP is seeking companies with a vaccine candidate to protect against exposure to ricin toxin.  This includes both companies that own or have access to Intellectual property (IP) and companies that do not own or have access to IP.  <br><br>As such, the Government is researching information on current industry capabilities and interest via responses to the questions below:<br>A. Describe your company's current vaccine candidate under development expected to achieve FDA licensure. <br>1. What is the current stage of development?  <br>2. Include explanation of product type.  Examples include small molecule therapeutic, large molecule therapeutic, vaccine, etc.<br>3. Specifically describe your nonclinical (animal studies), manufacturing and clinical progress.<br>B. Please explain the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your candidate based on the attached TRL definitions. <br>C. As these candidates will likely be developed under the Animal Rule, what animal species, if any, have been selected and/or used?  Has the FDA accepted the species used to support the Animal Rule?<br>D. Does your company own or have a license to intellectual property (IP) related to a ricin vaccine?  If so, please describe the state of your company's rights to the IP.  If your company is not a manufacturer, how do you intend to enable another party to manufacture the product? <br>E. Describe your company's manufacturing capabilities.  Are the vaccine candidates manufactured in house or subcontracted?  Does your company oppose technology transfer to a DoD funded advanced manufacturing facility?<br>F. Indicate company business size (based on the NAICS size standard), business status (i.e., large business, small business, disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.), and date of incorporation.<br> <br>In addition to providing the information requested above, respondents are invited to provide materials explaining their capabilities to fulfill the CBRN prophylactic requirement specified above, including: a description of their candidate which clearly supports its prophylactic potential; specific capabilities related to the development of the candidate; program management structure; and intellectual property availability. Respondents should indicate if their level of interest is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br><br>Questions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to the CBMS e-mail address listed below within 5 days after RFI release.   <br><br>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br>All written responses must be received within thirty (30) days of issuance of this RFI.

() The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.

Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions.

<DESC>Per request from industry, a brief synopsis of the MDCA Architecture is being provided: <br /><br />The MDCA architecture is characterized by a federated network of subsystems, devices, and software services that communicate across a core IP network. The subsystems will interface to the network by way of a common set of open-standard protocols, and allow other subsystems and/or user interface applications to access or control their functionality. Subsystems will provide a means of performing automatic service discovery, and will implement security and access control measures to meet information assurance requirements.<br />The intent of the MDCA architecture is to provide:<br />- Consolidated user interface(s) for accessing multiple subsystems<br />- Reduced space, weight, and power (SWaP) requirement on a vehicle platform<br />- Improved interoperability between subsystems<br />- Increased subsystem modularity and reduction of proprietary interfaces<br />- Allow for new functionality through software applications (sensor fusion, slew-to-cue, location-based services, etc.)<br />- Facilitate rapid integration of new subsystems<br />

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />For the<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />National Protectorate and Programs Division (NPPD) National Cyber Security Program<br />Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III Project.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) as identified in FAR 15.201 (c)(7). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall be not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cyber Security Division is requesting industry feedback on existing Government product performance requirements involving the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III project. The objective of SAIR Tier III is to provide U.S. Government (USG) agencies the ability to assess, assure, monitor, and measure the security posture of their information technology (IT) assets in a timely manner (i.e., near-real time.) This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and initiatives related to this request. Additionally, respondents will have the opportunity to comment on the draft product performance requirements for SAIR III listed on Attachment 2.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate industry feedback on Government SAIR III technical requirements then the Government may hold an industry day to answer any specific questions related to this RFI. The Government may use feedback that results from this RFI and industry day to further refine technical requirements to potentially establish qualified product list (QPL) for COTS products that can be utilized by federal, state, and local Governments for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>If the development of a QPL results from this RFI, DHS NCSD will be responsible for managing the QPL in terms of testing and evaluating COTS products to ensure proposed products meet any developed SAIR III minimum technical requirements. This QPL will be developed for multiple federal agency use. Product acquisitions will be at the discretion of each individual agency. The potential QPL may be established as guidance to assist federal agencies in managing information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLOB) was created in 2005 to improve the level of information systems security across government by eliminating duplication of effort, increasing aggregate expertise and enhancing the overall security posture of the Federal Government. This value proposition is supported through the use of Shared Service Centers (SSC's), consolidated acquisitions, agency standard practices and lessons learned across agencies.<br />In 2007, the ISSLOB launched a series of procurements under the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Initiative. Based on guidance from the Federal Systems Security Governance Board (FSSGB), the oversight body of the ISSLOB, the SAIR procurements follow a tiered execution approach. The SAIR initiatives are aimed at providing an efficient, cost effective mechanism to deliver enhanced information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise. <br />The cyber landscape in which federal agencies operate is a constantly changing and dynamic environment. Threats to the nation's information security continue to evolve and government leaders have recognized the need for a modified approach in protecting our cyber infrastructure. The new approach moves away from historical compliance reporting toward combating threats to our nation's networks on a real time basis. The tools and services delivered through the SAIR Tier III project will provide federal agencies with the ability to enhance/automate their existing continuous network monitoring capabilities, correlate and analyze critical security-related information, and enhance risk-based decision making at the agency and federal enterprise level. Information obtained from the automated monitoring tools will eventually feed CyberScope and allow for the correlation and analysis of security-related information across the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>2. SAIR III TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The capabilities sought for SAIR Tier III are:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to document, track, and discover both authorized and unauthorized IT assets. Such as NIST-SCAP validated asset management tools. <br />2. Configuration Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to assess, monitor, and report compliance of agency-specified security configuration settings and patches, as well as real-time altering of changes to approved baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access and security controls. Such as NIST SCAP-validated FDCC scanners and authenticated configuration scanners. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software security weaknesses; and report the associated potential exposure risks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS<sup>TM</sup>). , For example: NIST SCAP-validated authenticated vulnerability &amp; patch scanners, unauthenticated vulnerability scanners, source code security analyzers, web and database vulnerability scanners.<br />4. Malware Detection Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, isolate, characterize, and report known malware for supporting agency's security incident response process. Such as Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC<sup>TM</sup>) -compatible malware tools. <br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Reporting Tools. Products that provide the ability to collect, associate, compile, and report security posture metrics in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness. For example: The governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) reporting tools and FISMA security authorization management tools.</p>
<p>Where the capabilities are defined:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Function: System functions that support the management of hardware and software inventory baseline by documenting, tracking, and discovery of agency-responsible IT assets (i.e., hardware, software, and virtualized configuration items); and to identify unauthorized IT assets.<br />2. Configuration Management Function: System functions that support the management of security configuration baseline by documenting and tracking compliance with agency-specified security configuration settings and software patches (i.e., compliance with Federal Desktop Core Configuration [FDCC], USG Configuration Baseline [USGCB], and Security Technical Implementation Guides [STIGs], etc.) This includes system functions that provide continuous real-time detection and alerting of unauthorized changes to baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access, and security controls for perimeter defense and the core IT operating environment. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Function: System functions that discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software weaknesses (i.e., the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [CVE&reg;] and the Common Weakness Enumeration [CWE<sup>TM</sup>]); , and support the understanding of their associated potential exposure risks (i.e., metrics generated from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [CVSS] and the Common Weakness Scoring System [CWSS<sup>TM</sup>].) <br />4. Malware Detection Function: System functions that discover, identify, characterize, and locate known malware in a standard language (i.e., the Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization [MAEC<sup>TM</sup>]) for supporting agency's incident response process.<br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Report Function: System functions that collect, associate, compile, and report metrics that support analysis in the understanding of security posture in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness."</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) addresses the ISSLOB's information systems security need for tools to support a continuous monitoring capability. <br />The draft performance requirements these tools must possess can be found in the attached document, SAIR III Product Performance Requirements for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>3. RFI PURPOSE AND LIMITATIONS:</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />For the<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />National Protectorate and Programs Division (NPPD) National Cyber Security Program<br />Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III Project.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) as identified in FAR 15.201 (c)(7). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall be not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cyber Security Division is requesting industry feedback on existing Government product performance requirements involving the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III project. The objective of SAIR Tier III is to provide U.S. Government (USG) agencies the ability to assess, assure, monitor, and measure the security posture of their information technology (IT) assets in a timely manner (i.e., near-real time.) This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and initiatives related to this request. Additionally, respondents will have the opportunity to comment on the draft product performance requirements for SAIR III listed on Attachment 2.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate industry feedback on Government SAIR III technical requirements then the Government may hold an industry day to answer any specific questions related to this RFI. The Government may use feedback that results from this RFI and industry day to further refine technical requirements to potentially establish qualified product list (QPL) for COTS products that can be utilized by federal, state, and local Governments for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>If the development of a QPL results from this RFI, DHS NCSD will be responsible for managing the QPL in terms of testing and evaluating COTS products to ensure proposed products meet any developed SAIR III minimum technical requirements. This QPL will be developed for multiple federal agency use. Product acquisitions will be at the discretion of each individual agency. The potential QPL may be established as guidance to assist federal agencies in managing information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLOB) was created in 2005 to improve the level of information systems security across government by eliminating duplication of effort, increasing aggregate expertise and enhancing the overall security posture of the Federal Government. This value proposition is supported through the use of Shared Service Centers (SSC's), consolidated acquisitions, agency standard practices and lessons learned across agencies.<br />In 2007, the ISSLOB launched a series of procurements under the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Initiative. Based on guidance from the Federal Systems Security Governance Board (FSSGB), the oversight body of the ISSLOB, the SAIR procurements follow a tiered execution approach. The SAIR initiatives are aimed at providing an efficient, cost effective mechanism to deliver enhanced information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise. <br />The cyber landscape in which federal agencies operate is a constantly changing and dynamic environment. Threats to the nation's information security continue to evolve and government leaders have recognized the need for a modified approach in protecting our cyber infrastructure. The new approach moves away from historical compliance reporting toward combating threats to our nation's networks on a real time basis. The tools and services delivered through the SAIR Tier III project will provide federal agencies with the ability to enhance/automate their existing continuous network monitoring capabilities, correlate and analyze critical security-related information, and enhance risk-based decision making at the agency and federal enterprise level. Information obtained from the automated monitoring tools will eventually feed CyberScope and allow for the correlation and analysis of security-related information across the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>2. SAIR III TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The capabilities sought for SAIR Tier III are:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to document, track, and discover both authorized and unauthorized IT assets. Such as NIST-SCAP validated asset management tools. <br />2. Configuration Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to assess, monitor, and report compliance of agency-specified security configuration settings and patches, as well as real-time altering of changes to approved baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access and security controls. Such as NIST SCAP-validated FDCC scanners and authenticated configuration scanners. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software security weaknesses; and report the associated potential exposure risks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS<sup>TM</sup>). , For example: NIST SCAP-validated authenticated vulnerability &amp; patch scanners, unauthenticated vulnerability scanners, source code security analyzers, web and database vulnerability scanners.<br />4. Malware Detection Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, isolate, characterize, and report known malware for supporting agency's security incident response process. Such as Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC<sup>TM</sup>) -compatible malware tools. <br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Reporting Tools. Products that provide the ability to collect, associate, compile, and report security posture metrics in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness. For example: The governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) reporting tools and FISMA security authorization management tools.</p>
<p>Where the capabilities are defined:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Function: System functions that support the management of hardware and software inventory baseline by documenting, tracking, and discovery of agency-responsible IT assets (i.e., hardware, software, and virtualized configuration items); and to identify unauthorized IT assets.<br />2. Configuration Management Function: System functions that support the management of security configuration baseline by documenting and tracking compliance with agency-specified security configuration settings and software patches (i.e., compliance with Federal Desktop Core Configuration [FDCC], USG Configuration Baseline [USGCB], and Security Technical Implementation Guides [STIGs], etc.) This includes system functions that provide continuous real-time detection and alerting of unauthorized changes to baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access, and security controls for perimeter defense and the core IT operating environment. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Function: System functions that discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software weaknesses (i.e., the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [CVE&reg;] and the Common Weakness Enumeration [CWE<sup>TM</sup>]); , and support the understanding of their associated potential exposure risks (i.e., metrics generated from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [CVSS] and the Common Weakness Scoring System [CWSS<sup>TM</sup>].) <br />4. Malware Detection Function: System functions that discover, identify, characterize, and locate known malware in a standard language (i.e., the Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization [MAEC<sup>TM</sup>]) for supporting agency's incident response process.<br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Report Function: System functions that collect, associate, compile, and report metrics that support analysis in the understanding of security posture in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness."</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) addresses the ISSLOB's information systems security need for tools to support a continuous monitoring capability. <br />The draft performance requirements these tools must possess can be found in the attached document, SAIR III Product Performance Requirements for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>3. RFI PURPOSE AND LIMITATIONS:</p>

This contracting effort is required to prevent a break in service of critical ISR requirements in support of the warfighter. Unless otherwise stated herein, no formal request for proposal or additional written information is available. A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis, posting, is published for informational purposes only. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). Under FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency, Insitu is the only source which can fulfill mission critical requirements and ultimately prevent serious injury to the Government personnel and equipment as a result of any delay(s) to the schedule. Such delays could result in loss of life or significant property damage to US and Coalition Forces in the areas or operation.<br />Subcontracting opportunities should be sought directly from Insitu. IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERESTED PARTIES: there are no commitments by the Government to issue any solicitations, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for efforts mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. No telephone responses will be accepted. Point of contact for this synopsis is Mr. Jeffrey Norris. Responses to this synopsis should be by fax to 301-757-6516 or by email to Jeffrey.a.Norris@navy.mil. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
