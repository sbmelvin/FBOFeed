<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Transportation intends to award a sole source acquisition, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(2) (i) (A) to:   Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council (GLITC) P.O. Box 9 Lac Du Flambeau, WI  54538-009 Physical Address:   2932 Hwy. 47 North Lac Du Flambeau, WI  54538-009 The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Transportation (BIADOT) has the authority to provide technical assistance and training in the areas of transportation, transportation planning, recreational travel and tourism under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Sec. 6004 Education and Training Program.  This provided for the establishment of the Tribal Technical Assistance Program (TTAP) under the Federal Highway Administration’s Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP).  This section of ISTEA also provides for the use of the BIADOT administrative funds associated with the Indian Reservation Roads program (IRR) to finance these efforts.  ISTEA is considered an economic stimulus package designed to enhance the National Highway System, with the goal of stimulating U.S. tourism.  The role and participation of American Indian Tribes in ISTEA also changed the way Tribal Governments had been involved in the planning and development of their transportation infrastructure.  As such, the BIA recognized that there was a great need for technical assistance and training to bring Tribal Governments to a level, to effectively take advantage of possible opportunities.  BIA lends its support by coordinating resources, and participating in projects and initiatives of the Federal Government related to recreational travel and tourism.  The BIA has participated in Memoranda of Understanding through the Department of Interior’s initiatives to support the inclusion of Federal and Tribal lands in forums where the tourism industry has sought to enhance their share of the market, by promoting and including Federal and Tribal partners in their state and regional efforts.  The American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association (AIANTA) was established to help produce conferences focusing on tourism programs and professionals.   In February 2006, the Secretary, Department of the Interior, identified AIANTA as the organization the Federal Government works with to support American Indian tourism development.   The administration of AIANTA has been managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, contracting with the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council (GLITC) as fiduciary.  The BIA and other Federal agencies provide funds to AIANTA and the American Indian Tourism Conference through GLITC as they are an established 501(c) 3.  At this time the BIADOT is able to offer AIANTA funding to help with the establishment of an office and Executive Director.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No formal solicitation shall be issued.  You may submit your interest via fax to:   Linda Somuah Contract Specialist Bureau of Indian Affairs 2051 Mercator Drive Reston, VA  20191

<CONTACT>William Gray Deputy Area Manager 5097540214     ;
<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Ephrata Field Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory, assistance, and consulting services with Mr. James V. Cole to assist Reclamation with his knowledge and expertise and as a witness during litigation by submitting court and other documents and affidavits in support of Reclamation's programs including water rights claims and proof of appropriations, in the matter of CV. No. 06-204-RHW brought by Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District, et al., (BSID. The work required is as follows: 1.	Research historical documents, court orders, memorandum opinions, judgments, and legislative record and authorizations. 2.	Prepare in draft and final format correspondence, reports, opinions, and records pertaining to water rights, water usage and water contracting activities. 3.	Provide expertise to the Field Solicitor and Department of Justice. 4.	Locate project data to be used in the preparation of affidavits and briefs for submittal to the court. This work will be performed by the contractor using unique knowledge gained over 3 previous lawsuits filed by the BSID. The contractor was the manager at the time of establishment of the Quincy Groundwater Management program, including the groundwater licenses and yearly billing of charges. The timeframe for performing this task will be dictated by the requirements of the court. This work will consist of functioning as a witness for Reclamation during the litigation of the BSID lawsuit. The contractor will work with legal counsel for the Government to develop, prepare and deliver testimony in all forms when required by the Government. The contractor will also assist legal counsel in development and preparation of testimony for other witnesses within the Government's case.  Mr. Cole retired from the Bureau of Reclamation in 1997 after 32 years of continual employment with the agency.  During his career he worked on the Columbia Basin Project (Project) as an economist from 1965 until 1970, as Chief, Water and Land Operations Division from 1973 until 1977, and then as Project Manager from 1977 until 1994 when he became Area Manager for the Upper Columbia Area headquartered in Yakima, Washington. Reclamation requires the services of a contractor who has in-depth knowledge of Reclamation's water rights, legislative authorizations, historical precedents and regulations, repayment and water service contracts, court decisions, unique State statutes, Federal contracts and Acts of Congress affecting the water rights in the Columbia Basin Project and throughout north-central Washington, Idaho and Montana.  Reclamation also requires specific knowledge of the inter-relationship between State and Federal water law as it pertains to ground and surface water rights, the contractual relationships and roles of Reclamation and its contracting water entities and individuals.  Because of Reclamation's contractual obligations to other water users throughout the Project and Field Office area and the complexity of the water rights and contracting processes, it is not possible to find other contractors capable of providing for our immediate needs.  Further, during Mr. Cole's service to the Columbia Basin Project, he has developed a unique knowledge of Project history, documents and reports and has become extremely familiar with relationship between State and federal water law, Reclamation's relationship with its contracting irrigation districts, and the existence and location of highly relevant materials which often play a vital role in protecting United States' interests.  Therefore, it is to the Government's interest to acquire the services of Mr. Cole. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Please send any responses to Connie Morgan, Purchasing Agent, Bureau of Reclamation 1917 Marsh Road Yakima WA 98901

Pilgrim's Progress Preservation Services specialty is working on historic structures using the Standards set by the Secretary of Interior for structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The refuge has been unable to find other contractors who meet these standards for work on National Register structures.  They are very familiar with the construction techniques used on other peter French Buildings (the Round Barn and nine building at Sod House Ranch) and because they performed the assessment of the P Ranch Long Barn they understand the extent of the repairs that are needed to make the barn safe and accessible for the public.  Many of the repairs needed were identified by Pilgrim's Progress while they were completing other projects on the refuge.  Their Intimate knowledge of the buildings constructed by Peter French, their understanding of the construction techniques used to construct building in the 1880's and their excellent work on previous projects means that the current project will proceed efficiently and with little or no time spent learning about the project and building repair needs.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)(ED) intends to award a modification in the amount of $125,000.00 to GSA Schedule Task Order DE-AT01-06ED80700 with AMS Consulting Group (formerly Alliance Management Systems, Inc.) of Silver Spring, Maryland. This action is for additional effort and a one-year extension to the performance period, which will now conclude September 30, 2008; the initial award was March 31, 2006. The extension will increase the Task Order Not-to-Exceed Ceiling from $97,470.20 to $222,470.20. The additional effort will involve analyzing General Accountability Office (GAO) surveys and Forecast surveys, including reporting of recommendations to the OSDBU related to DOEâ€™s small business subcontracting programs. Tasks include attending meetings, reviewing and assisting OSDBU in developing questionnaires for distribution and completion by DOE contracting/procurement activities; compiling and analyzing the data. AMS will also provide subcontracting plan reviews, develop model subcontracting plans, identify new and current requirements which can be performed by small businesses at the prime or subcontracting level. This extension is due to AMSâ€™ familiarity with the DOE business/procurement model (i.e., the network of facilities and laboratories managed and operated by major prime contractors, including universities) and its extensive experience in supporting both OSDBU and the numerous DOE facility management contractors in past reviews of their subcontracting programs, and in application of small business laws and regulations to the DOE organizational structure, and is able to perform the necessary reviews and analyses to meet extremely tight reporting OSDBU deadlines. This existing knowledge and experience capability is critical to OSDBU compliance with agency reporting requirements.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source procurement for products needed in support of three remotely located tower weather stations. The Intent of Award is to Climatronics Corporation, 140 WILBUR PL STE 1, BOHEMIA, NY, 11716-2419;

NOTE: The weather station system must be able to be integrated and interchangeable with existing systems in terms of frequency bandwidth, power output, power consumption and physical dimensions that are owned by Climatronics Corporation;

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTALLATION OF METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEM;
 
The Downfall meteorological system will consist of three (3) remote sites located at Cowbell, Dagrag and Downfall Tower. Each remote site will consist of a 54 foot high tower instrumented at the 54 and 12 foot level. The towers will be hinged at the ground level and will include a winch-pole assembly that allows the towers to be lowered to the ground for maintenance purposes. Electronic interfaces, radio and data logger will be located in a NEMA-4X enclosure attached to the tower at a height that will allow convenient access from the ground. Each site will measure wind speed and wind direction and ambient temperature at the 54 and 12 foot levels, plus relative humidity and barometric pressure at the 12 foot level. Power for the remote sites will be provided by a 40 Watt solar panel and a 34 AH rechargeable battery. The remote sites will communicate with a PC at the downfall base station using 900 MHz spread spectrum radios. The tower instruments will be scanned by the remote site data loggers once every second and the base PC will update the weather data base information at predetermined time intervals. A graphic display of the current weather data, operator selectable from any one of the three sites, can be viewed on the base station PC. The base station PC will also automatically archive the data from the three sites at software selectable intervals. The Downfall system will be incorporated in to the AFRL RockNet meteorological system at a later date. This will require some modifications to both hardware and data logger programming; 

Vendor will: 

1. Design, build, test and document the system at their factory;

2. Install the tower concrete foundations at the three remote site locations with coordination assistance from local Downfall personnel;

3. Assemble and erect the towers, install all instrumentation and communications equipment at the remote and base sites;

4. Power up and test the operation of the complete system at Downfall and turn the system over to the Downfall Tower operations personnel;

Responses may be sent via e-mail to Roberta.Ross@edwards.af.mil or mailed to AFFTC/PKX, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Roberta Ross.  

Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.

<DESC>The FDA intends to award a sole source procurement to Tetracore, Inc located at 9901 Belward Campus Drive, Rockville MD 20850. Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
An award will be made nine(9) calendar days from the date of this notice.

Description of Acquisition:
(1) TC-8005-005 Bot Tox Bio Threat alert kit
(2) TC-8011-025 Abrin ELISA kits 64 

Background:
The CFSAN/ FERN scientists under strict and CDC approved protocols use the various kits or reagents requested by the above mentioned vendor to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nations food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance CFSAN?s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply. The FDA has a critical need for kits and reagents used to detect the characterization of foodborne pathogens. 


Sole Source Justification: 
TETRACORE is the sole manufacturer of the bio threat alert kits and supplies and accessories.   No other method has been approved by CDC for the detection program submitted by FDA-CFSAN under the select agent registered program and there are no potential substitutes.  There are no other vendors that can provide the capability required for FDA/CFSAN?s research program.  There are no approved substitutes and there are no similar instruments.   

The methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the ?gold standard?, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the bio threat alert test kit provides uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.  To select any other kits and reagents would place FDA/CFSAN research in this area out of step with the research community and would reduce both the capability and credibility of research in this critical scientific arena.  

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by September 4, 2007.

<DESC>* * * THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION. * * * All information necessary for offerors to submit responsive proposals is contained herein. --- The General Services Administration's Office of Citizen Services and Communications (OCSC) provides citizens, businesses, other government agencies, and the media with an easy way to obtain information and services from the Federal government. OCSC provides information and services through the web, e-mail, in print, and over the telephone. OCSC's Office of USA.gov Technologies implements innovative technologies that improve the delivery of government information and services to citizens in order to make government more citizen-centric and results driven, as outlined in the President's vision for E-Government, which is at the core of the White House Management Agenda. The Office of USA.gov Technologies is responsible for providing technical infrastructure, search engine, video streaming, web analytics and other services for the USA.gov web portal, and for the development of best practices for affiliated agencies and E-Government initiatives. Launched in September 2000, USA.gov (formerly FirstGov.gov) allows citizens to find official government information through browsing the portal or through search functionality. The requirement calls user demographic and usage preference and practice data in depth from a professional research firm that is currently engaged in the regular compilation of such data using statistically accurate survey methods. The general usage data will be analyzed as a proxy for general usage of government websites nationwide. With the subscription to be acquired hereunder, the government plans to gain insight into consumer Internet and digital media behavior that will enable the evaluation of those activities against services provided by the USA.gov and USASearch services. Further analysis will define relationships between the sites, what top referring sites or destination sites relate best to the government's web properties, how visitors typically reach government information channels, and what activities and transactions visitors usually engage in through those channels.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice-SIA
RFP # HHM402-07-R-0087

SUBJECT:  Request for Proposal RFP of the Solutions for Intelligence Analysis (SIA) Support IDIQ

The SIA program will satisfy a wide range of analysis initiatives in support of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and other intelligence community customers.  Specifically, the SIA program requirements cover defense subjects, areas of interest, and intelligence topics. Vendors shall provide the expertise to allow the defense intelligence community to meet all operational and mission requirements relating to the following four overarching topic areas: Gathering and Collection, Analysis, Utilization, and Strategy and Support, each having numerous related sub-topics. 

In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) contemplates establishing one or more Indefinite Delivery type contracts in support of the SIA program. The Government intends to award contracts to only those vendors that can provide the full range of services as required in subsequent Request for Proposals (RFP).

Vendors are encouraged to engage in Contractor Teaming Arrangements with other contractors to provide a complete solution to the Government?s requirement.  Any teaming arrangement shall contain a clearly designated team leader/prime along with team members.  The contractor designated as a prime shall serve as the focal point for interactions with the Government during the entire phase of this acquisition process.  Prime contractors may only participate on a single team. The number of team members per team is not limited.  All team leaders and teaming partners must be in compliance with all terms and conditions of the solicitation prior to submission of a response.  If a response to this RFP fails to demonstrate compliance with these terms and conditions, the Vendor will not be considered for an award.

As a result of this RFP, the Government intends to make an estimated five (5) awards, yet reserves the right to award none, or any other number of contracts, depending on the quality of submissions.  The decision to award more than one contract is within the Government?s unilateral discretion and subject to the Contracting Officer?s determination as to whether or not multiple awards are in the Government?s best interests.  The actual number of awards will depend heavily on the evaluation of the proposals. The evaluation factors will include: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Small Business Participation, and Cost. 

The VACA anticipates that subsequent task orders will be placed against the awarded contract(s) over a five-year period.  Orders will be competed using criteria per the ordering procedures outlined in the FAR Part 16.5. These orders will be priced against established hourly rates, discounted as applicable, for a total firm fixed price or ceiling price against performance based requirements to the maximum extent possible. The anticipated award of these contracts and subsequent delivery orders are expected in early FY08.  The VACA estimates that the total price of all work to be performed under the contract(s) will exceed 
$1 billion.  This figure is only an estimate and there is no guarantee that any orders will be placed.  

The SIA schedule is anticipated as follows (all dates are estimated):
?Request for Proposal Issued: 		27 August 
?RFP Questions due to DIA:		30 August (1200)
?Pre-Proposal Conf. Registration*:	30 August (1200)
?Pre-Proposal Conference in DIAC:	13 September (0830-1100)

*A maximum of three representatives per team will be admitted to the SIA Pre-Proposal Conference to be held on Bolling AFB, in the DIAC.  

Questions shall be submitted to Ms. Donna McMullen, Contracting Officer, via fax (256)-313-7660 
Or e-mail at: dimcmdr@msic.dia.mil

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Government intends to purchase, on a sole source basis in accord with FAR 6.302-1, perpetual right-to-use licenses and updates to systems engineering software, proprietary to Vitech Corporation, 2070 Chain Bridge Rd Ste 320 Vienna VA 22182-2536.  The requirement includes the following:  (1) licenses and software, quantity 2 each, to CORE V5.1 Systems Engineering Tool Suite/Workstation software, part number WS-50-100; (2) licenses and software, quantity 2 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on V5.5, part number WS-50-110; (3) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 12 months from date of software acceptance, quantity 2 each, to CORE Workstation, part number MN-00-100; (4) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 12 months from date of software acceptance, quantity 2 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on,  part number MN-00-110.  Software shall be delivered electronically FOB Destination to NSWCDD within 7 business days after a!  ward of order/contract.   No other software will satisfy this requirement at this time due to interoperability requirements with current work in progress created using the previous version of CORE.  There are also training and other infrastructure considerations.  System Engineering tools are complex, and require trained users to be effective.  CORE is widely used at NSWCDD, and is taught by the educational institutions that provide advanced education in Systems Engineering for the NSWCDD workforce.  CORE is approved for use on the NMCI network, and is one of the few known Systems Engineering tools that meet all the capability requirements for multiple work efforts, which include (1) requirements management, (2) integrated, executable architecture development, to include specifications for all of the DoD architecture Framework (DoDAF) views, (3) mission decomposition analysis, and (4) integrated document and configuration management.  CORE is extremely flexible and extensible, which allows it to adap!  t for a variety of different analyses.  Continued use of CORE will allow current work to continue without interruption for retraining or for conversion of previous CORE files to other applications.  Consideration may be given to competitive software for possible future use, particularly for Systems Engineering tools that are well-established within the acquisition community and are supported with appropriate training. The Government will consider statements, from all responsible sources, which clearly evidence capability to provide the required proprietary items within the required delivery schedule.  Capability statements must be submitted via email to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@navy.mil, must be received NLT 8 days after publication date of this notice, and must reference Quotation Number N00178-07-Q-3051.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, however, quotations that are not accompanied by a capability statement that evidences the ability to deliver the items specified herein will not be considered for award.  Award is to be made under Simplified Acquisition (FAR Part 13) and Commercial Items (FAR Part 12) Procedures.  The Government will not issue a written solicitation as all items are specified in this notice.  Closing time and date is 4 September 2007 2:00 PM ET.

This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The shipping containers were specially designed by CRC exclusively for the AN/AQS-20A EOID/VSS.  The Government does not own the technical data package for the containers nor the foam insets that would allow competition on this procurement.  Initial inventory objectives were not considered sufficient to warrant procurement of a product level drawing package including unlimited rights and data.  As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), CRC is the only company with the in-house resident knowledge to accurately manufacture this critical hardware.  Use of another company to provide !  the repair may introduce new or change existing parameters that may be detrimental to the packaging and shipping of these critical systems.  Therefore it is imperative that these items are acquired from Container Research Corporation as soon as possible.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure Monthly Fee Auto Level Detector; Multiple Deliveries of 1650 Gallons total of Liquid Bulk Liquid Nitrogen for 1 Month (Total ? 1,201,098 Gallons. Liquid Nitrogen is delivered when automatic level system requires refill) from Airgas (put the address).  Building 5 requires liquid nitrogen stored in 2 large tanks; it is plumbed as both gas and liquid into building 5.  This is a critical resource for scientific research in building 5 and if interrupted and shutdowns occur it will be detrimental to several laboratories and research projects. Filling the two tanks is triggered by an "auto-sensing level indicator" that communicates with Airgas by wireless telemetry.  This telemetry is required because of the highly variable rates of gas usage in the building. Historically, the Institute intends to purchase this service contract by other than full and open competition from Airgas. To the best of the Government?s knowledge they are the sole manufacturer and distributor of this equipment.  Interested vendors may identify, in writing, their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Officer prior to the closing date of this notice.  Award will be made based on Best Value.  Responsible vendors that are capable of providing NIDDK with this service may request a copy of the RFQ in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code:  541511.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ).  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CGI Federal, Inc. for enhancements to the services currently being provided under an existing contract (Examiner Workstation or xWorks, Contract OFHEO-2005-01C).  xWorks is based on Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)  technology that has been customized as necessary to meet and provide the business process functional requirements and needs of OFHEO.  It automates the preparation, review, centralized storage, and retrieval of documentation generated by and associated with OFHEO's supervisory process of the two Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)(the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)).  This synopsis is required because the anticipated changes are outside the scope of the existing contract based on the current dollar value of the contract.  The enhancements include:  1) Enhanced Access Controls; 2) Risk Structure/Risk Ratings; i.e. re-architecting the folder structure to allow implementing revisions to the risk structure and risk ratings; 3) Earned value management on the aforementioned work; i.e. enhanced access controls and risk structure/risk ratings; 4) FileNet 4.0 Upgrade; and 5) Support to ensure compatibility with OFHEO infrastructure upgrades.  CGI Federal, Inc. is the only contractor with the expertise to provide these enhancements in a time-effective manner, has the current expertise on the existing system, and at a cost that is reasonable to the effort required.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying OFHEO's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Ms. Janice L. Uthe, Contracting Officer, at janice.uthe@ofheo.gov.  A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with Chelton, Inc., 1955 Lakeway Drive, Suite 200, Lewisville, TX  75057-6425. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Chelton, Inc., is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's minimum requirement    The contract type is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Price type contract in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Contract Line Item Numbers and descriptions are:  CLIN 0001 -  P/N GD1813P66 V/UHF Antenna (192 each) to include shipping if any.  This project requires multi-band antennas for VHF/UHF Line of Sight (LOS) transmission and reception to work in conjunction with fielded AN/PSC-5D and AN/PRC-117F radios.  This project has an ongoing requirement for a high performance, broadband, mobile U/VHF antenna that meets the following salient characteristics:  capable of spring mounted parasitically excited sleeve monopole UHF band with a whip element primarily for use with VHF, 30-512 MHz; an impedance of 50 Ohms (nominal); a radiation of azimuth-essentially omni-directional (nominal); BNC female connectors; RF Power with a minimum of 50 watts (cw) maximum; a maximum weight of 7.9 lbs and height of 39.6"; and meets the environmental requirements of MIL-STD-810E.  Continued procurement of these antennas is required to maintain the configuration management (CM), interchangeability, interoperability, and logistical footprint of fielded systems.  This equipment is currently in use and has proven successful in its missions.  Any deviation from the current infrastructure could jeopardize current operations.  The purchase of any other antennas would result in a significant duplication of costs to the government to modify the current design, recreate baseline drawings, testing and validation costs, operator and maintenance training costs, in addition to the logistical costs of managing two different systems.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 11 September 2007, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  For information contact Cindy Wilson, Code 2.5.1.2.2.2, Telephone (301) 995-8672, FAX (301) 995-8670 or via e-mail: cindy.wilson@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>17 -- AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<SOLNBR>R1650
<CONTACT>Thomas Siracusa tom.siracusa.ctr@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Request For Information (RFI) and not a Solicitation (27 August 2007)  The ability to provide assured Airfield Management (AM) is a vital capability for Joint Forces.   The USAF is interested in information about Airfield Management Systems that can be used during the inspection of airfield facilities to determine, inspect, identify, report and follow-up on the availability/functionality of airfield systems.

Statement of Work
 For 
DeltaSym? Base Frame Components To Complete
a F-35/JSF Manned Flight Simulator (MFS) Capability

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

1.1	Introduction and Background
The Air Warfare Mission Simulation (AWMS) program has recently upgraded the simulator capabilities at the Avionics Test and Integration Complex (ATIC) of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA, with reconfigurable cockpits and 360-degrees visual systems.  These reconfigurable Manned Flight Simulator (MFS) systems enhance the capability of the Air Force to carry out Performance and Flying Qualities (P&FQ) tests, and Mission Rehearsal simulation of various types of single seat tactical aircraft.  These simulators will provide a high fidelity ground test capability for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) for the Air Force.  Future capability enhancements will enable piloted weapon system evaluations, including electronic warfare and Mission Effectiveness tests.  It is a natural extension of the AFFTC's testing expertise to provide manned weapon systems simulators in support of all phases of the acquisition process.  This effort will provide the base frame system components of a reconfigurable cockpit to support the F-35/Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) MFS requirements.

This STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) defines the requirements for the fabrication, delivery, inspection/acceptance test, and documentation of one DeltaSym? Base Frame System in support of the AWMS program.  This effort will be managed by the 412th Test Support Squadron (TSS)/DRP, and delivered to the 722nd Test Squadron/EWOS of the Electronics Warfare Group (EWG), 412th Test Wing.
The AWMS and the JSF programs have recently developed and delivered three sets of JSF Simulator Consoles?that when attached to the base frames of the reconfigurable cockpits simulate the performance of the military aircraft cockpit?to the MFS facilities at the ATIC.  Two fully functional JSF MFS systems are currently operational at the ATIC, however, a third DeltaSym? Base Frame System is required to complete a third JSF MFS capability.  The third console hardware, including center console/instrument panel, and side consoles are currently undergoing modification to match the F-35/JSF AA-1 test aircraft cockpit configuration.  The ATIC has recently completed modifications in room 119 of building 1020 to accommodate a third MFS system.  A third Visual System procured under the AWMS program is scheduled for delivery and setup in room 119.  This Visual System (projectors, mirrors, screens, mechanical structure, etc.) is scheduled to be integrated in 2007 with the third F-35/JSF cockpit?comprised of the AA-1 consoles and a DeltaSym? Base Frame System (including a third DeltaSym? Virtual Input/Output System)?as part of a complete reconfigurable MFS system.  

1.2	Scope

The salient characteristics of a Reconfigurable Cockpit Base Frame System (BFS) that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Group?s (EWG) Manned Flight Simulators (MFS) are: 
a)	BFS must allow for the accurate relative placement, within ? inch, of all controls;
b)	BFS must provide rudder pedals that simulate the real aircraft pedal configurations, including yaw control, nose-wheel steering, and ground braking of the simulated aircraft; 
c)	the pedal placement within the BFS must be adjustable to accommodate the aircraft variations and normal pilot adjustments for rapid reconfiguration; 
d)	BFS must include a programmable control loading system that provides force feedback through the controls to the pilot [This control feedback must provide both fixed (user programmable) and dynamic (scenario dependent) control loading thus allowing configuration of breakout force, dead band, force gradient, detents (multiple gradients), hysteresis (force and position), friction, damping, displacement limits, and stick shaker (associated with stall and buffet) capabilities]; 
e)	BFS structure must support the weight and size of actual panel mounted components;
f)	BFS must allow for space for component cooling and routing of power and signal cables;
g)	BFS must accommodate multiple system power components, including power conditioning (to prevent damage by voltage and frequency transients), power distribution and isolation equipment for individual system components as necessary to prevent one component?s operation from impacting another component, and multiple AC and DC power supplies?with all these components located in the cockpit base frame EIA bays to support the power needs of the cockpit consoles.  
h)	BFS must accommodate at least three (3) separate data acquisition chassis, to be installed in the cockpit base frame EIA bays, and be able to be connected directly with cockpit devices mounted in the side and front consoles;  
i)	BFS position must be adjustable relative to the out-the-window scene display, such that the nominal pilot?s eyepoint can be aligned to the eyepoint of the out-the-window scene;
j)	BFS must be separable from the out-the-window scene generation system (visual system), to allow configuring any specific cockpit with any specific visual system;
k)	Docking, alignment and locking mechanisms must be provided to ensure the correct alignment of the cockpit structure with the visual system;  
l)	BFS design enables the pilot to safely egress the cockpit unassisted;  
m)	BFS must provide a safety power-down capability to remove all electrical power, and this emergency power shutdown for the cockpit is to be located in and near the cockpit via at least two remote control devices (one for the pilot and one for the operator); and
n)	The cockpit base frame maneuverability is to be such that the cockpit is readily moveable, requiring no more than four (4) persons;  
o)  BFS must meet current F-35/Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program flight simulator
      requirements in support of the current A.4 Program Introduction Document;
p)   BFS must incorporate the Virtual Input/Output System to provide rapid  
      reconfiguration of the flight simulator cockpit, both with and without the primary  
      host simulation system;
q)	Virtual I/O System must provide digital and analog input/output capabilities and 
       electronically connect to all the appropriate cockpit instruments and controls;
r)	Virtual I/O System Software must be easily reprogrammed to interface with any aircraft cockpit configuration and any simulation software to support MFS requirements;

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Entech Instruments Inc, 2207 Agate Ct, Simi Valley, CA  93065-1839 as the only responsible source that can provide components for and authorized installation for upgrading the existing gas chromatography sample collection, preparation, and transfer system at the Naval Environment Health Center Consolidated Industrial Health Laboratory San Diego, CA.. The upgrade shall be compatible with existing Agilent gas chromatographs and sample transfer equipment from Entech. The offeror must provide a complete system (i.e. be able to provide all of the requirement, not portions of the requirement.)

This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 are incorporated.     NAICS 334516 (Size Standard - 500 Employees for purposes of reporting contact action).

The Evacuated Canister Sample Transfer System is a fully automated state-of-the-art system that collects, measures, concentrates, and transfers samples to a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) instrument. This automated sampling system utilizes specially coated evacuated canisters to collect air samples in the workplace. The autosampler then automatically transfers a measured volume of air sample from the canister, concentrates and cryogenically introduces the sample into a GCMS instrument that analyzes a large variety of organic solvents at parts per billion levels. The Canister Sampling system autosampler can handle twelve 1.4 liter canister samples. All of the instruments and its accessories are fully integrated, controlled and operated by computer hardware with Windows software communications interface. Utilizing an advanced GC/MS as the instrument analyzer, this canister sample transfer system will analyze diverse unknown sample requests with high sample throughput obtaining reliable, sensitive, low detection levels. 
INSTRUMENT USE: This Canister Sample Transfer System will be used to analyze trace levels of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds and solvents found in air samples. The majority of samples will be samples collected in industrial workplaces used to evaluate and protect worker exposure to toxic and hazardous chemicals. Examples of clinical use would include sampling worker exposure to diesel exhaust, poor indoor air quality, mold analysis, formaldehyde, other carbonyls, and other semi-volatile compounds found in workplaces. Information from samples analyzed will provide medical personnel with rapid worker toxicity information in addition to exposure prevention. This instrument will provide sensitive, rapid, and specific analysis of safety, industrial hygiene, and occupational health clinic sample requests performed by the laboratory. 
INSTRUMENT COMPONENTS: The Evacuated Canister Sample Transfer System components include four main modules, with other peripheral parts. The 3-stage preconcentration module, the oven canister cleaning system, the large volume GC injection system, and the robotic canister autosampler with sample tray and transferring module. Other components that complete the system are a selection of twenty 0.6 liter capacity Silonite coated mini-cans and twenty 1.4 liter capacity Silonite coated mini-cans for sample collection. Various regulators, valves, and connectors are included with the system. The system with its accessories is fully integrated, controlled and operated by Windows proprietary software that runs the system. See below for additional information on the components required.

In order to reduce tobacco use and the subsequent morbidity and mortality caused by its use, scientists need to identify core measures in domains traditionally identified by epidemiologists as agent, host, vector, and environment.  The agent (the agent or organism that causes disease) is the tobacco product.  The host is the smoker or chewer/dipper or potential smoker, chewer, or dipper.  The vector (the organism that distributes the agent) is the tobacco product manufacturer, marketing, and retail system.  All three of these domains influence each other and are influenced by familial, social, economic, historical, political, legislative, and media factors.  This work is proposed to compile and evaluate tobacco control measures which complements the work completed as part of a supplemental grant to Building the Evidence Base for Tobacco Control Policies (1 P50 CA111236-01). 

The purpose of this procurement is to compile and evaluate tobacco control measure for the NCI.  The contractor shall:  1) Add approximately 42 additional tobacco control measures to the ToBIG database, identify source(s) of measures (where they were developed and tested, and identify where one can go to get more information about measures; 2) Perform updates for readability to approximately one third of questionnaire comparison spreadsheets and; 3) Write a report that describes the database, that will facilitate development of a ToBIG workspace/portal/interactive web-based tool.  

Period of Performance shall be from September 15, 2007 through September 14, 2008

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The licenses are essential elements of the proprietary Consular software application supporting and making possible the  Bureau’s worldwide 10 print fingerprint capture initiative, which must be completed by the end of calendar year 2007. The Homeland Security Council decided on June 7, 2005 that the USG standard for biometric screening of foreign nationals coming to the United States should transition from two fingerprints to ten fingerprints.  This will enable the two major USG fingerprint systems, the DHS IDENT system and the FBI IAFIS system, to establish interoperability.  The transition to ten prints also will enable the Bureau of Consular Affairs to clear visa applicants' fingerprints against the FBI IAFIS system, which in turn will allow consular officers to more effectively screen out applicants who are ineligible due to criminal history records.  Consular officers eventually will be relieved of the task of reviewing long lists of non-exact NCIII name results to determine if an applicant may have a criminal history record.  DHS/CBP also is moving to ten-print collection at the ports of entry, expecting to deploy by 2008. The 10 print capture initiative will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must “issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers”.   To capture applicant fingerprints, third party software must be integrated in the Consular software application. This allows for immediate fingerprint quality measurements, finger segmentation and packaging in a submission format compatible with FBI systems.  The NISTPack Server application is the third party software used by CA.<BR><BR>CA/CST’s Systems Engineering team identified two products that offered what were judged to be acceptable levels of support for this process. These products were developed by Cogent, Inc. and Aware, Inc. The DoS used the COGENT software application to support the single fingerprint (index finger) capture required for the two print bio-visa program. However, in tests of the Cogent and Aware products conducted prior to the initiation of 10 print capture, Aware’s NISTPack software was judged better able to support the program. The Aware product’s fingerprint scoring was more accurate and outputs more frequently conformed to the FBI’s and other Federal agencies’ acceptance requirements.  It was also noted the fingerprint capture process was approximately 10 seconds faster per applicant when NISTPack was used than it was when the Cogent product was used.  A ten 10 second processing time savings per applicant is of particular significance at large volume posts processing 2000 applicants per day as it is equivalent to a full day’s processing time.  In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Aware NISTPack Server and site licenses without delay so that the Department’s worldwide implementation and use of the 10 print fingerprint capture system modules may be completed by the end of calendar 2007.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Aware NISTPack Server software  has undergone tests and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board (CCB).<BR><BR>

Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  

1.  EXPERIENCE . (1) The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) office projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation, and meets all the following characteristics: (a) New construction was for an office building including site, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, interiors and fire protection systems;  (b) The project met one (1) of the following criteria: (i) The building size was not less than 250,000 gross square feet, or (ii) The construction cost at award of the construction contract was not less that $50 million for the complete building.

5. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business, however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  The GSA goals for subcontracting are as follows: small businesses at least 41% of total subcontracting planned; small disadvantaged businesses at least 12% of small business subcontracting planned and small women-owned businesses at least 5% of small business subcontracting planned.  

6.

This amendment changes the original response from 12 Sep 07 to 4 Sep 07 to coincide with the submission of the Statement of Capabilities.  Additionally, this amendment removes the NAICS code 541710.

The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) invites interested participants to participate in an Industry Day for the Spiral Development and Sustainment Engineering contract of the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS).  The Industry Day will be held at the Secret/NF level on 12 Sep 07, 10:00 ? 11:00 A.M., at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A8 auditorium, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA.  Each contractor company division will be authorized no more than 3 attendees.  

The contract is expected to have a period of performance of 6 years and begin with a contract transition and spiral development efforts beginning on 1 Sep 08.  It is expected that system sustainment will begin on 1 Dec 08.  System improvements will be accomplished as 18-24 month spiral developments throughout the life of the system.  It is expected that spiral development efforts and sustaining engineering efforts will be approximately equal.

JETSS is in use at JFCC-Space?s Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) as a mission planning and execution monitoring tool of space control assets.  JETSS consists of previously developed software (JAVA software language with WebLogic basis), relational database (Oracle), server (Sun Solaris operating system)-client (Windows) architecture, and commercial-off-the-shelf software applications integrated into a seamless program.  

In order to perform this effort, prime contractors should have extensive knowledge of service oriented architecture/net-centric enterprise services, federated query systems, relational databases, and Information Assurance requirements.  Firms must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret ? SCI/SAP/SAR accredited SCIF(s).  Additionally, firms must have SAP/SAR approved facilities to perform system depot maintenance.  

     If you have interest in being a prime contractor you must submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) not longer than 10 pages describing their qualifications to be the prime contractor as well as explaining their capability to meet the above mentioned knowledge and security clearance requirements.  In addition, the SOC should contain the following information:  technical description of the offeror?s experience and knowledge of Department of Defense military system development and maintenance, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Control systems and operations (specifically JSpOC operations), AFSPC Command and Control (C2) operations/architectures, and JSpOC C2 tool development; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation.  Additionally, include customers and POCs who can be contacted to validate previous work/qualifications identified in the SOC.  The SOC should be submitted to SYAG/CJD, Attn:  Maj Diane Brashear, and SYSW/PK, Attn:  Mr. Jack May, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA  90245-2808, or e-mail to diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil and jack.may@losangeles.af.mil, and received by 9:00 A.M. on 4 Sep 07.  It is the Government?s intent that due to the classified nature of this acquisition that no contractor will be given access to any Request for Proposal (RFP) documents if they cannot demonstrate in their SOC submission that the are capable of performing this effort as a prime contractor.

Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Appropriate small business standards are North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services, with a size of $25 million.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  

To attend Industry Day, please send your RSVP (company name, attendee name and contact number) via email to Maj Brashear, 310-416-1630/diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil, no later than 12:00 P.M., 6 Sep 07.  In addition, your visit requests should be submitted via JPAS no later than 12:00 P.M., 7 Sep 07.  Send the certification to JPAS SMO Code ?SYS Wing?.  If attendees are unable to send visit requests via JPAS fax them to 310-416-1725, Subj: JETSS Industry Day, Attn: Steve Taylor.

Validated potential primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors will be expected to submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) prior to receiving the RFP.  Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort.  A full fledged DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS will be required.  If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and is currently accredited by another agency, then that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort upon coordination with SYSW Security.  Contact Mr. Crafton (310) 416-1591, gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil, regarding information/paperwork that will be required.  SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While an accredited SCIF and TS/SCI SSBI cleared personnel are not requirements to participate in the 12 Sep 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified JETSS RFP without having approved personnel and a secure SCIF in which to store information.  

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS A MODIFICATION FOR THE PREVIOUS POSTING --- 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center (FIC) intends to procure services to analyze data to explore spatial and temporal relationships between respiratory infections across the U.S. and determine relative burden of respiratory pathogens, in particular influenza and RSV from Corinne M. Ringholz, Rochester, NY. Ms. Ringholz is continuing her dissertation research and it will be framed around the present project that is being conducted at FIC. 

The Institute intends to purchase these services by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

Ms. Ringholz will be responsible for data collection, data analysis and generation of draft manuscript related to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). This project uses state-based hospital discharge (SID) databases from AHRQ to study the temporal-spatial relationship between incidence of hospital admission for viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in the U.S.  The hospitalization data will be compared with surveillance data fro specific pathogens from the CDC and State Health Departments.  Mathematical modeling and statistical packages will be used to investigate the relationships to the level of zip code, by several age groups and by calendar weeks.  Time series methods will be used to look for interactions and synchronicity between pairs of respiratory pathogens.   

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may request a copy of the Request for Quotation. Offerors may request a copy of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that the RFQ, NIH-FIC-07-375 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>A -- Management of the Primate Aging Database
<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

Semi-annual progress reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract.  The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month.  Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months.  A semi-annual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.  Semi-annual progress reports shall include any changes in Contractor personnel, the number of staff-hours committed to the contract project for the reporting period, the source and number of data points entered into the database for each species, a summary of revisions to the codebook completed during the reporting period, a list of investigators who received login passwords to the database, a list of publications resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.

A final report shall be submitted to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) on or before completion of this contract.  The final report shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including the number of data points entered for each species, investigators who received the database, publication resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.  Two (2) copies (CDs) of the most up-to-date version of the database shall be submitted to the Project Officer with the final report.

Interested small businesses are invited to submit a capability statement addressing the ability to satisfy the requirement.  The capability statement should reference sources sought synopsis number NIHAG2007001 and should be no longer than 15 pages in length (personnel qualifications are not included in page count) and shall include the following:  (1) name and address of the company; size standard and small business program status of the company as listed under www.ccr.gov; (2) point of contact with name, title, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address; (3) DUNS number; (4) contractor's capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability, knowledge, and experience specific to the requirements set forth in the draft statement of work; (5) lists of three clients to whom similar types of services have been previously provided within the last three years to include contract number, dollar value, and name and telephone number of point of contact; and (6) qualifications and experience of any key personnel likely to perform directly under any resultant contract.

This notice is not a solicitation and thus formal proposals or quotes are neither required nor requested.  

The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b).  FAR Part 13 applies to this acquisition ? however, FAR Part 13.5 does not apply as the estimated dollar value of this acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

The government intends to solicit this requirement from DWC?URMC because it is the only source that meets each of the following 13 qualifications, skills, and experience:

1.	Project management staff and product creation staff who are all bilingual in English and ASL
2.	Project management staff and product creation staff that include bilingual medical professionals knowledgeable about the subject matter contained in the source documents
3.	Extensive experience in the process of creation, translation, and adaptation of health education materials for Deaf audiences, and at least three examples of that work available for review
4.	Extensive knowledge of Deaf culture
5.	Evidence of involvement and participation in the life of the Deaf community
6.	Deaf healthcare experience
7.	Knowledge and ability to recruit and hire Deaf actors
8.	Production personnel with experience in working with Deaf actors
9.	Voice talent that is bilingual in ASL and English
10.	Expertise in production of multimedia products that can be posted on the Internet
11.	Expertise in production of multimedia products designed for people who are deaf
12.	Ability to convene an expert panel of people bilingual in English and ASL who have sufficient medical knowledge to compare the source material to the products, evaluate the products for learning point inclusion, and assess the products for goodness of fit for a general Deaf audience
13.	The requirement continues previous work and as such the government requires product consistency (e.g. presentation, content, style etc.).  

Offerors interested in this requirement shall submit a written response to the contracting officer that demonstrates their qualifications, skills, and experience in each of the 13 areas identified above.  Responses must be received not later than 4:30pm ET, by the modified response due date (September 04, 2007).  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis.  A determination by the government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competitive basis, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Respondents assume all financial costs for responding to this notice and the government assumes no such financial obligation.

<DESC>INTERESTED VENDORS SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM TO TEST RADIOFREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TAGS AND SYSTEMS OF CERTAIN SHIPMENTS.                        

EPA is seeking interested RFID vendors to participate in a program to test a unique use of RFID for shipping certain chemicals/materials from generator to receiver.  The shipping scenario would include checkpoints along the way, including across North American borders.  

The project offers multiple challenges, including:  Tag data should be capable of capture in an information-management system.  Read range should be 5-10 feet, with 100% read capability through metal, liquid, solids, and viscous materials; tags should be resistant to environmental factors, including heat, humidity, impact, vibration, acids, dirt, and radiation; individual item tagging in a pallet packing configuration, with approaching 100% unobstructed read rate; the use of multiple storage facilities and trucking firms; tracking at choke-points along the travel route.  System security is vital.  

Selected vendors would have the freedom to design the tagging configuration and the type of tags used, and we are looking for innovative solutions for this difficult shipping scenario.  

This program is being carried out under EPA's Environmental and Sustainable Technology Evaluation (ESTE)/Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program, and is a partial cost-sharing program.  The project is targeted to high-risk Agency needs, and will have high visibility.  Results of the testing will be verified by the USEPA and will be published.  EPA will initiate and directly manage verifications of up to 10 potential vendors in the first round of testing.  

Questions may be submitted to Julia Capri at Julia.Capri@erg.com by September 14, 2007.  Questions and accompanying answers will be provided to all who have responded.  JULIA CAPRI IS THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS SOLICIATION. DO NOT contact Cheryl O'Donnell.  For any questions concerning this soliciation please contact Julia Capri (email preferred/at Julia.Capri@erg.com) or  (513) 791-9405.

<DESC>This synopsis revises the pre-solicitation notice issued on 14 Aug 2007 for Intersystems Cache Products and Services, RFP # VA-200-07-RP-0053.  Coincident with this synopsis is the issuance of revised solicitation VA-200-07-RP-0053 01, which was posted 27 Aug 2007.  The due date for offers has been extended until 12:00 PM CST, 31 Aug 2007.  The Contractor is required to provide the software, media, software license, and software maintenance/upgrade and technical support services for Intersystems Cache.  The license type is Department of Veterans Affairs 30-year term Enterprise license (purchased via Contract V200P-1735).  Software maintenance includes periodic updates, enhancements and corrections to the software, and reasonable technical support, all of which are customarily provided by the Contractor to its customers.  Distribution of maintenance copies shall be accomplished by using an appropriate magnetic, electronic or printed media.  The VA owns approximately 138000 licenses of Cache, of which 45000 were converted to a platform independent Enterprise license in FY 2007 under contract V200P-1735.  For the remaining 90000 that require conversion, the VA is contemplating BRAND NAME OR EQUAL product description--this description would also apply to any expansion of the VA license inventory.  Specifically, the VA requires brand name or equal to the Intersystems Cache product.  Salient characteristics are the product must operate on the VMS operating system, fully support the M (MUMPS) programming language, and provide both object projection as well as hierarchical access to data.  It must also support multiple co-existent database instances on a single cluster as well as provide database access via ECP (or equal) to other system instances either on the same or dissimilar operating platforms.  Specific line item requirements are Intersystems Cache license conversion of remaining 90000 licenses as above, annual maintenance and technical support for all Cache license inventory, expansion or true-up modification of license inventory, and associated training services.  This is a total Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside in accordance with Public Law 109-461.  The revised solicitation number is VA-200-07-RP-0053 01, and it's issued as a commercial RFP in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 15.  Contract type is fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity with base and 4 option years (FAR Clause 52.217-9 is included).  A clause that would allow up to an additional 6 month extension beyond the 4 option years is also included (FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Contractors providing offers for Intersystem products and services must have a reseller agreement with Intersystems.  The applicable NAICS codes are 423430 (Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers), 541519 (other computer related services), and 611420 (Computer Training).  The Contracting Officer conducted market research and is not aware of any products in the commercial market place that meet or exceed the salient characteristics of Intersystems Cache.  Though the solicitation due date is 31 Aug 2007; the Contracting Officer would be open to answer any questions or concerns regarding the brand name or equal product description up until 7 Sep 2007.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/DFRC to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet and to solicit information from interested parties regarding support of hypersonic flight experiments for NASA’s Phoenix Missile Hypersonics Testbed (PMHT).  Researchers without specific experiments, but with general interest in hypersonics flight test, are encouraged to respond. This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow interested parties the opportunity to state interest in the usage of and comment on the development of such a testbed. Background All access to earth or planetary orbit, and all entry into earth’s atmosphere or any heavenly body with an atmosphere from orbit (or super orbital velocities) require flight through the hypersonic and supersonic regimes. The hypersonic flight regime often proves to be the design driver for most of the vehicle’s systems, subsystems, and components. If the United States wishes to continue to advance its capabilities for space access, entry, and high-speed flight within any atmosphere, improved understanding of the hypersonic flight regime and development of improved technologies to withstand and/or take advantage of this environment are required. Also recent advances have contributed to a resurgent interest in supersonic cruise flight. Sonic Boom reduction technology may make overland supersonic cruise a reality. However, it is only through NASA investment in new technologies and improved design methods that the benefits of increased cruise speed will become a reality for the general public. These benefits include improved quality of life through reduced travel time for business and pleasure, rapid delivery of high value cargo including time critical medical items and rapid response of disaster first responders. Supersonic cruise technology is also of interest to the U.S. Department of Defense Agencies. DOD studies have indicated that the capability of rapidly striking targets at long range could be a key element of the U.S. future defense strategy. Supersonic cruise vehicles are considered to be potentially important elements of this strategy. The significant barrier common to both military and civilian supersonic cruise is efficiency.	Similarly high levels of efficiency must be achieved under strict limits on environmental factors such as airport noise, sonic boom, and high altitude emissions. Researchers at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center (DRFC) at Edwards, CA, partnering with the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA, are investigating the use of surplus demilitarized Navy AIM-54 Phoenix air-launched missiles as hypersonic research testbeds.   The Phoenix missiles used for hypersonic research will have their explosive warheads removed, and their tracking and guidance systems replaced with a smaller, lightweight, Global Positioning System (GPS) aided guidance and control system. The missiles will be heavily instrumented to acquire and downlink data from experiments in such areas as thermal protection materials, scramjet propulsion, guidance and control, boundary layer transition and aerodynamics at hypersonic and supersonic speeds. The PMHT will be launched from a NASA F-15 aircraft flying at speeds up to Mach 2.0.  The anticipated test conditions range from Mach 3.0 with a dynamic pressure of 2000 psf for a 20 second duration to Mach 5.0 and a dynamic pressure of at least 500 psf for an 8 second duration.  Planned available payload volume is up to 6 cubic feet within a 15” diameter envelope.  The estimated allowable payload weight is 250 lbs.  A minimum of 200 Watts power is available to the payload for the experiment duration.	Future capability may include a deployable nose cone, allowing exposure of payloads to freestream flows.  Additionally, a Mach 6.0 test condition is possible with a reduction in weight from the tactical missile. At present, NASA DFRC is performing design, analysis, and testing leading up to a Critical Design Review at the end of 2007 and an operational capability by FY09.    NASA DFRC is interested in designing the PMHT to meet requirements for a variety of hypersonic experiments.  Engineering trade-offs between system cost and performance is required to maintain a viable program.	Therefore, technical feedback from academia and industry is necessary to achieve the maximum benefit to hypersonics research. Submission Information Specifically, respondents to this RFI are asked to submit the following information: 1.	Experiment description, test objective, and research goal. 2.	Desired test condition including test Mach number, dynamic pressure, and test duration. 3.	Payload weight, volume, data, and power requirements. 4.	Suggestions for adapting PMHT system capability to increase viability. 5.	Capability statements, overviews of past experiments in hypersonics research, and any literature, brochures, and references that further elaborate on the intended experiment goals and objectives.   The submission information has a page limitation of no more than ten (10) pages.  A page is defined as one side of a sheet, 8 ½” x 11”, with at least one-inch margins on all sides, using not smaller than 12-point type. Title pages, tables of contents, indices, and blank divider pages are excluded from the page count. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is Industry's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This is a request for information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the NASA DFRC will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA DFRC nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Any documents related to this RFI will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/DFRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	  Technical questions should be submitted to: DFRC-Hyper-Sonic@mail.nasa.gov. All responses shall be submitted to DFRC-Hyper-Sonic@mail.nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. (PDT) on October 31, 2007.

The INL Afghanistan Justice Advisor will provide advice and assistance to ensure the successful implementation of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Afghanistan. The justice advisor will be a member of the Embassy Special Committee on Rule of Law and will represent INL?s justice programs to senior U.S., international and Afghan officials.  

INL is responsible for implementing U.S. foreign assistance programs designed to complement Afghan and international efforts to reestablish Afghanistan?s justice sector.  Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to increase public awareness and access to justice. 

To achieve these goals, the Justice Advisor must be able to effectively oversee three major contracted programs and possibly more in the future including (1) the Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP) with about 30 U.S. advisors, (2) the Corrections System Support Program (CSSP) with about 33 U.S. advisors, and (3) the LL.M. program, a grant with the University of Washington School of Law to train about 20 Afghan law professors.

The Justice Advisor will also be responsible for assisting and overseeing smaller grant programs and developing new initiatives in coordination with the Embassy and INL Washington.  The Justice Advisor will ensure that these programs are being effectively implemented, meet the needs and goals of the Afghan Government, are coordinated with the international community and NATO forces, and are briefed to senior U.S. Embassy and visiting officials.

The Justice Advisor will also ensure that INL Washington receives timely information and reporting to ensure that senior Department, Interagency and Budget briefings are fully informed of developments on the ground.  The Justice Advisor will work with in-country and Washington-based contract officer-designates in addition to working with the program office in Washington, DC.  However, the Justice Advisor?s direct chain of command is through the U.S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS).

<LOCATION>Bureau of Reclamation
<ZIP>80225
<OFFADD>Bureau of Reclamation - Upper Columbia Area Office 1917 Marsh Road Yakima  WA 98901
<SUBJECT>R--Sole Source Intent
<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Ephrata Field Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory and assistance services with Ms. Donna Postma. Ms. Postma will assist Reclamation with her knowledge and expertise and as a witness during litigation by submitting court and other documents and affidavits in support of Reclamation's programs including water rights claims and proof of appropriations, in the matter of CV. No. 06-204-RHW brought by Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District, et al., (BSID). Ms. Postma will work with experts from the Washington State Department of Ecology to develop a management program for the use of ground water in the 508-14 management area. Proposed tasks include: Research and prepare documents for the Federal Government's case in the BSID lawsuit, provide testimony and declarations for use by the Federal Government in the BSID lawsuit. Working with the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE), and develop a joint management program for the 508-14 waste, seepage and return flow management area. This work will be performed by the contractor using unique knowledge gained over 3 previous lawsuits filed by the BSID. The contractor also has worked with the programs directly associated with the management of the Quincy Groundwater Management program, including the groundwater licenses and yearly billing of charges. This work will consist of functioning as a witness for Reclamation during the litigation of the BSID lawsuit.  The contractor will work with legal counsel for the Government to develop, prepare and deliver testimony in all forms when required by the Government. The contractor will also assist legal counsel in development and preparation of testimony for other witnesses within the Government's case.  The proposed contractor will be working with personnel from DOE in the development of a joint management program for utilization of the waste, seepage and return flows moving through the 508-14 area. Water in the 508-14 area has been imported by Reclamation during irrigation of the Columbia Basin Project since 1952. Reclamation made claim to the water and the DOE agreed that the water was Reclamation water and should be subject to licensing by Reclamation. The contractor has worked directly with a similar program called the Quincy Groundwater Program for many years as the groundwater specialist and Manager of the Environmental and Contracts workgroup at the EFO.  The timeframe for performing this task will be dictated by the requirements of the court. It is anticipated that the lawsuit will be litigated by the end of fiscal year 2009 but may extend beyond at the behest of the court.  Ms. Postma worked for Reclamation as a Manager of the Environment, Contracts and Water Rights Division at the Columbia Basin Project/Ephrata Field Office for the past 18 years.  Prior to her work for Reclamation, Ms. Postma worked as a Reclamation Reform Act Specialist for the Quincy Columbia Basin Irrigation District.  During her career with Reclamation, Ms. Postma acquired unique knowledge and skills in water rights, repayment contracting and Reclamation law.  Reclamation requires the services of a contractor who has in-depth knowledge of Reclamation's water rights, legislative authorizations, historical precedents and regulations, repayment and water service contracts, court decisions, unique State statutes, Federal contracts and Acts of Congress affecting the water rights in the Columbia Basin Project and throughout north-central Washington, Idaho and Montana.  Reclamation also requires specific knowledge of the inter-relationship between State and Federal water law as it pertains to ground and surface water rights, the contractual relationships and roles of Reclamation and its contracting water entities and individuals.  Because of Reclamation's trust responsibility to Native Americans, contractual obligations to other water users throughout the Project and Field Office area and the complexity of the water rights and contracting processes, it is not possible to find other contractors capable of providing for our immediate needs.  Further, during Ms. Postma's long service to the Columbia Basin Project, she has gained a unique knowledge of Project history, documents and reports and has become extremely familiar with relationship between State and federal water law, Reclamation's relationship with its contracting irrigation districts, and the existence and location of highly relevant materials which often play a vital role in protecting United States' interests.  Therefore, it is to the Government's interest to acquire the services of Ms. Postma. Ms Postma's unique knowledge of Federal regulations, Washington State law and the requirements of a ground water licensing program make her the only available person to work on Task 3 of this contract. Her years of unique experience associated with the prior BSID lawsuits and her knowledge of what have been done previously again make her the only available person to supply testimony on the operations of the Quincy Groundwater program for the past 18 years. While others have knowledge of aspects of the lawsuit, Ms Postma has knowledge of aspects that no one else has worked with.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Please send any responses to Connie Morgan, Purchasing Agent, Bureau of Reclamation 1917 Marsh Road Yakima WA 98901

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) requires the renewal of the NET Standard Remote Service Maintenance Package. The NET Standard Remote Service Maintenance Package provides access to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC), 24 hours a day / 7 days a week phone support, software licensing, software upgrades, next business day hardware replacement and remote repair for 24 each NET SHOUT 900 Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) gateway session controllers. NET Federal is the only authorized distributor of these services and CACI is the only authorized remote repair facility provider for the NET services required to support and maintain these systems. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Network Equipment Technologies (NET) Federal, 2166 Ridgetop Circle, Suite 100, Dulles, Virginia 20166. Any interested parties may e-mail carlos.mayorga@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6156, SSgt Carlos Mayorga, no later than Friday September 5, 2007; 9:00 a.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any proposals received by Friday September 5, 2007 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

The NET Federal SHOUT 900 VOIP gateway session controllers are integrated into the JCSE VOIP backbone. The SHOUT 900 bridges the circuit based, analog voice calls into the Internet Protocol (IP) network. Its patented Best Signaling Protocol (BSP) allows for significant savings in bandwidth over other analog to IP conversions systems. This unit is integrated into the JCSE Small Command and Control IP packages as well as the Global Information Grid access points utilized at the Defense Information Systems Agency Standard Tactical Entry Point (DISA STEP) sites. Without this controller, civilian authorities and government agencies will not be able to communicate effectively during or in the aftermath of a natural disaster or terrorist act. Shout VOIP is the IP hardware and software currently used by JCSE. It has already been tested for reliability and security. To purchase another system would mean forfeiting a system currently valued over $900K and absorbing the costs and efforts involved in procuring and implementing another system (i.e., approvals, new system cost, time to employ new system, training of personnel, etc.). It is not reasonable nor would it be cost effective to purchase another system when it too would require the renewal of its services. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition.

NOTE:  FAR Clause 52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds is in effect for this requirement. 

52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer (End of Clause).

Below are the questions that shall be addressed in your response to this RFI: 

1.	What are the best overall testing methods to certify that the financial management software meets Federal FSIO requirements?

2.	How can we best evaluate if a vendor is capable of installing/integrating/validating FSIO certified Financial Management Software and is qualified to be a shared service provider (SSP)?

3.	What are the best methods for evaluating technical and management capabilities outlined in a proposed common solution?

4.	In what stage of the acquisition process should testing be used for evaluating proposed solutions?

5.	What testing and evaluation processes should be performed for agency acceptance testing that would build on the evaluation of a SSP?s capabilities?

6.	What criteria should be used to evaluate a SSP?s proposed solution to the FSIO baseline requirements?

7.	What is the best method to verify that vendors are employing the common standard solutions once they have been finalized and added to FSIO requirements?

8.	Is there a better model for testing and evaluation than our current proposed model detailed in tables 1 and 2 below? 

9.	How can FSIO designate SSPs before the financial business process standards have been defined and how would you conduct the evaluation process? How could designated SSPs be evaluated once all the business process standards are defined?

4.0	Background

In 2001, President Bush created the President?s Management Agenda to address the need for citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based federal government initiatives. The success of the President?s Agenda depends on agencies working as a team across traditional boundaries to better serve the American people and focusing on citizens rather than individual agency needs.   Building upon the efforts of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program to expand E-Government, the Office of Management and Budget launched the Lines of Business (LOB) initiatives with a goal of finding projects that fall into lines of business that were not originally identified as a part of the 24 e-government initiatives: financial management, grants management, and human resources management.  Each of the lines of business identified core business requirements and processes.  

The Lines of Business initiatives afford agencies an unprecedented opportunity in a period of fiscal restraint to influence the direction of specific core business functions for the Government by leveraging technology to adopt industry and government ?Best Practices? and to standardize and eliminate redundant stovepipe and inadequately maintained systems throughout Government.  

The Office of Management and Budget and the established LOB Task Forces are focused on a business-driven, common solution and target architecture developed through an architectural framework.  The definitions of these key characteristics of the LOB approach include:

?X	Common Solution ? End to end shared service capabilities needed to achieve the LOB Statement of Objectives through a Target Architecture that includes business process, technology solutions, and data standardization.
?X	Target Architecture ? End state toward which all efforts are directed; it will be the architecture for some future date and will be the target toward which integration efforts will be directed.
?X	Business Driven (vs. Technology Driven) ? Solutions address distinct business improvements that directly affect LOB performance goals.   
?X	Developed Through Architectural Processes ? Solutions are developed through a set of common and repeatable processes and tools.

The vision of the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) is to establish the framework for government financial management solutions that are efficient and improve business performance while ensuring integrity in accountability, financial controls, and mission effectiveness. The FMLoB has several goals:

?X	Achieve or enhance process improvements and cost savings in the acquisition, development, implementation, and operation of financial management systems through shared services, joint procurements, consolidation, and other means;
?X	Provide for standardization of business processes and data elements;
?X	Promote seamless data exchange between and among Federal agencies; and 
?X	Strengthen internal controls through real-time interoperability of core financial and subsidiary systems.
5.0	FMLoB Shared Service Provider (SSP) Strategy
Common Solution

A shared services model using competition among private sector and federal shared service providers (SSPs) is the desired outcome. A small number of high performing Federal agencies and commercial vendors would ultimately provide the entire Federal Government with Financial Management (FM) services. The SSPs will provide IT hosting, application management, and system implementation services to Federal agencies. Each SSP will provide these services to multiple agencies using a common solution. The common solutions must align with the vision, goals, and objectives of the FMLoB and be flexible enough to support agency specific requirements. The SSP must comply with all federal financial management laws and regulations. Other criteria sought from the SSPs are:

?	Use of core financial management software that was tested and certified by the Financial System Integration Office (FSIO).
?	Provide common data exchange interfaces for common government interfaces (e.g. payroll or e-travel).
?	Use of ?best practice? approaches and methodologies for standardized implementation tasks (e.g. change management, project management, training, data conversion, and interface development).
?	Compliance with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) requirements. 

The key to the Shared Service Provider approach is the competitive process.  The movement to these providers will reduce redundant approaches currently used in the management of financial systems across the Federal government.  The migration to SSPs will also reduce the risks and resources needed to implement modern core financial management systems by leveraging implementations that have proven to be successful.  Agency migrations will occur in a phased approach and follow the system development life cycle for FM.  Agencies that are planning to purchase a new financial management system or planning a significant upgrade to an existing system will be required to evaluate the common solutions provided by SSPs.  

Reliance on Standards

The long-term objective for FMLoB is to standardize core financial business processes as well as financial data.  Agencies will adopt these standard business processes as they migrate to new financial management systems. SSPs are expected to offer solutions that implement these standards.  The FMLoB is taking a collaborative, cross-government approach to developing standard business processes.  

The definition of standard data elements, data definitions, nomenclature, etc., and the creation of standard interoperability among core FM systems and subsidiary systems will be the output of the FMLoB data standardization effort.  This standardization will facilitate the exchange of data with other lines of business and common application E-Government (E-Gov) efforts such as E-Travel, E-Payroll, and the Integrated Acquisitions Environment (IAE) will promote seamless data exchange and improve internal controls. In addition, the standardization effort will improve federal financial management by:

1)	Developing additional requirements to support the standard processes and data requirements building on and enhancing the standardization efforts of the central agencies OMB and Treasury, and other commonly used systems at GSA etc. 
2)	Allowing financial management personnel across the government to learn and speak the same ?language?, enhancing common core competencies, and providing ?economies of skill?.

The development and implementation of these standards will, by themselves, improve the integrity of financial management at both the individual agency and government-wide levels and will help agencies to comply with financial management laws and regulations such as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA).  Standardization also provides additional benefits.  It will facilitate the development of additional systemic internal controls (business rules) through the identification of required relationships among processes and data.  Adopting these new process and data standards to manage financial information, will also involve changes to the existing financial management operations.  

Other Benefits

A significant weakness of current FM systems is the unavailability of financial information on a real-time basis to allow management to make pertinent decisions in a timely manner.  Currently available solutions are highly configurable and depending on the configuration chosen during the implementation, the system may no longer meet FSIO requirements. SSPs will be expected to offer solutions that address these issues.

The solution proposed will meet the FMLoB vision and goals by:

1)	Resulting in significant reductions in duplicative investment and redundant operating costs
2)	Reuse of best practices, proven approaches and methodologies for executing business processes within a given business function, especially where the agency has a current gap or need for improvement
3)	Faster and more consistent deployment of financial management capabilities 
4)	Improved standardization of practices and processes, leading to improved accountability and auditability


Current Testing and Evaluation Methods

FSIO currently tests commercial off-the shelf core financial management software packages to ensure they comply with FSIO core financial system requirements.  Software testing is performed following FSIO testing policy, and software that has passed all mandatory test steps is certified. Additional software test information can be found at http://www.fsio.gov/.  OMB Circular A-127 requires federal agencies to purchase only FSIO certified core financial management system software when upgrading or migrating to new financial management software.

Agencies typically require vendors to demonstrate that the solution being offered for their financial system acquisition can meet the agency specified requirements prior to selection.  This is typically done through a capability demonstration.  Once the selected software is configured, the agency will perform acceptance testing as part of the implementation process.  

The need to designate commercial shared service providers, and provide agencies with an acquisition vehicle to purchase services from those designated providers introduces an additional evaluation phase.  The SSP evaluation process includes the requirement that vendors complete a due diligence check list to indicate their capabilities and readiness to offer service.  

The types of evaluations in the current model are depicted in the following section:


Table 1. Evaluation Phases

Pre- Selection - FSIO Responsibility

?	Product Qualification Test - Comprehensive tests of common requirements compliance and document configuration
?	Provider Capability Demonstration - Federal financial event scenarios using baseline configuration



Selection - Agency Responsibility

?	Agency Technical Evaluation - Fit/gap analysis of SSP offerings and Agency non-core applications Risk/cost analysis

Post-Selection ? Agency Responsibility/Governance

?	Agency Acceptance - Operational test in actual system environment (Agency Responsibility)
?	Independent Verification & Validation - Confirms functionality delivered meets task order terms and acquisition goals (Governance)
 

Table 2. Purpose and Scope for Each Phase of Evaluation 

Product Qualification Test
?	Comprehensive testing of FSIO Core Requirements 
Service Provider Evaluation
?	Assess common requirements and policy compliance
o	FISMA security assurance 
o	Accessibility section 508 policy

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Assistance on Spanish Language Resources on Reading for Families
<SOLNBR>ED-07-R-0096
<RESPDATE>091907
<CONTACT>Keith Smiley, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-233-2043, Email procurement@nifl.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Literacy was established to ensure that literacy would have a place on the federal policy agenda and to invigorate a national effort to improve adult literacy.  Its primary activities to strengthen literacy across the lifespan are authorized by the U.S. Congress under two laws, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) in the Workforce Investment Act (PL 105-220, Title II, Subtitle A, Chapter 4, Section 242) and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  The AEFLA directs the Institute to provide national leadership regarding literacy, coordinate literacy services and policy, and serve as a national resource for adult education and literacy programs. The NCLB law directs the Institute to disseminate information on scientifically based reading research pertaining to children, youth, and adults as well as information about development and implementation of classroom reading programs based on the research.

The Institute is seeking technical assistance to develop additional Spanish-language publications for families of K-3 children who are learning to speak and/or read English.  The Institute seeks to introduce information about how K-3 children learn to read in a way that connects to Hispanic families' beliefs about the role of the family, community, and school in children's education.  The Institute expects that the publications will be developed organically rather than translate existing Institute publications.   As with the Institute's other NCLB-funded publications, scientifically based research must form the foundation of these publications.  (Note: The purpose of the companion English language overviews, outlines, and drafts is to allow non-Spanish speakers in the expert working group and on the Institute's staff to participate in the development of the publication.  They are not for publication.)

The Institute anticipates that this will be a fixed priced contract for a performance period of 15 months.

Please be advised that if your proposal is selected for funding, you will be required to complete an organization and/or individual registration in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) in compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-7 Central Contract Registration.  The database can be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.  Instructions on completing the registration can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.asp.  If you are already registered in the CCR, you are advised to review your information to ensure that your registration is complete and verified.

This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ("CSS").  All interested parties must email Keith Smiley, Contract Specialist, at procurement@nifl.gov to obtain a copy of the full CSS.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 
The Solicitation number is F1S0AZ7205B003. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 2007-08-02.  NAICS is 333415 and the size standard is 750 employees
This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside The Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA is seeking vendors capable of a Chiller that cools the Weibel radar system. 
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR WEIBEL RADAR COOLING SYSTEM:

Scope
The 412th RANS Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB), CA is currently installing a small liquid cooled Weibel radar system on a refurbished L3 Communications Brashear KINETO Tracking Mount (KTM).  The KTM is a fast response tracker capable of reaching unloaded angular speeds of 60?/sec and accelerations of 100?/sec2.  The estimated top angular speed/acceleration for the KTM loaded with the radar is 40?/sec and 60?/sec2.  The KTM is built with electrical slip rings to allow continuous rotation in the azimuth axis.  The elevation axis moves from -10? to +100?. There are no provisions for liquid cooling in the slip ring, so the chiller will have to be mounted on the azimuth axis.  The older chiller could not withstand being rotated and did not have the capacity to cool the radar on hot days.

Requirements:

General:
One chiller is required,

The contractor shall design, engineer, build and deliver a chiller that cools the Weibel radar system (P/N: MFDR-2100/37) while in operation on the KTM,

The chiller shall be a self contained vapor compressor based technology with an air cooled condenser.  The refrigerant shall cool a closed loop liquid coolant.  The chiller shall provide a circulating pump to circulate the liquid coolant to the radar unit,

The chiller shall have 1800 watts of cooling capacity or greater at an ambient condition of 120? F.  The chiller shall function up to 145? F ambient air temperatures but at a reduced cooling capacity,

The chiller shall accommodate lower cooling requirements and automatically adjust accordingly so that the radar system will be operating in its normal temperature range.  Depending on the radar target and ambient conditions the 1800 watts may be reduced by three quarters,

The chiller?s input temperature to the radar?s cold plates shall not go below the dew point of the ambient conditions,

The cooling liquid shall be water with antifreeze (glycol) mix,

The chiller shall deliver a flow rate greater then 1 gallon per minute.  The output pressure shall not exceed 60 PSI.  The radar has ?? hose fitting.  There can be a static pressure to accommodate the pump, but the static pressure shall not exceed 7 PSI,

The chiller shall fit into a space that is 12.5? H x 19? W x 28? L.  The hose and electrical connections shall accommodate the KTM and should be designed to fit into the confined space.  Both the 12.5? by 17.7? sides are generally open to accommodate air circulation and connections.  The maximum weight of the unit can be 125 pounds or less, but keeping the weight down is not a high priority,

The chiller shall function while undergoing angular accelerations of up to 60?/sec2 in the azimuth plane of rotation.  The maximum angular acceleration in the azimuth axis should not last more then a half a second for each occurrence.  The angular velocity will top out at 40?/sec and should not last more than 5 seconds for each occurrence,

The chiller shall be designed to withstand occasional vibrations and shocks from typical transportation on unimproved road conditions (dirt and gravel roads),

The chiller shall be built for outdoor use.  The KTM/radar and chiller will typically be covered with a weather resistant fiberglass shell, but could be uncovered at times for up to a week.  Rodents are a problem at Edwards AFB and the chiller shall be built to withstand rodent infestation,

1.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; USCG HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt?laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The USCG typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year.  Aircraft and its components are inspected in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer?s (OEM) periodic requirements in conjunction with the USCG?s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  HU-25 landing gear are serial tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair/overhaul, item location, and status. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) establishes the minimum requirements necessary to repair/overhaul HU-25 landing gear (main MLG and nose NLG).  Repair/Overhaul shall be accomplished IAW the manufacturer?s specifications except where specifically noted herein.  Messier?Hispano-Bugatti SA, Montrouge Cedex, France is the OEM.  The contractor shall have access to or ability to obtain current OEM component maintenance manuals (CMM), service bulletins (SB), modifications, and drawings as the USCG does not own, nor can it provide this data.
The information herein is not intended to be all inclusive nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer?s drawings, manuals, specifications and service bulletins except where specifically noted herein.

2.	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The USCG?s objective is to obtain services of an OEM or a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 landing gear.  Repaired/overhauled landing gear must meet OEM?s specifications IAW the OEM?s Component Maintenance Manuals, and Service Bulletins listed under applicable documents (as defined in paragraph 3.0).  All landing gear returned to service shall have FAA Form 8130 attached.  The contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul HU-25 landing gear.
2.2	The USCG anticipates at least two levels of service.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the prospective contractor technical and price proposal.  Prospective contractor may propose additional levels of service.
2.2.1	First, a repair or ?return to service? is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement as necessary, and testing to meet the OEM?s functional return to service requirements (component time continues).  A repair does not zero the Time Since Overhaul (TSO).
2.2.2	Secondly, Overhaul for ?High Time?.  This concept qualifies the type of component maintenance which imposes fixed limits for component removal, overhaul or scrap depending on the time in service or the number of landings.  Overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes complete overhaul of the landing gear assembly, incorporation of new service bulletins, and the replacement of additional parts as necessary. An overhaul zeroes the TSO.  Overhaul is required for landing gear that has reached a life cycle of 15 years or 10,000 landing or those that exhibit excessive wear.
2.2.2.1.1	The following Nose Landing Gear Components are life limited to 20,000 landings per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual 1U-25A-2, Chapter 05-40-00.  Landings for Life Limited parts are tracked to the NLG assembly.

7.0	EXCLUSIONS
Landing Gear received which indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization or severe damage   
due to mishandling or crash damage may dictate an exclusion from the prices specified in the schedule.  The landing gear shall be inspected, repair costs determined, and authorization to proceed obtained from the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of repair.  If the prospective contractor considers the landing gear a candidate for exclusion, he shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  (Verbal notification to the Contracting Officer shall be confirmed in writing).  The prospective contractor shall submit a proposal to cover the cost of the exclusion repair (the costs over and above the firm-fixed repair price) within thirty (30) calendar days after such notification.  The proposal shall include:  nomenclature, part numbers, cost and quantity of replacement parts, total labor hours, and a delivery schedule.  Prospective Contractor shall provide backup documentation to support the cost of the parts (other than the replacement parts identified within the schedule) such as invoices or catalogs.  The prospective contractor?s delivery obligation for the landing gear identified shall be suspended as of the date of notice to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer will (within 30 calendar days after receipt of the prospective contractor?s written proposal) make a written determination (subject to the ?Disputes? Clause) as to whether or not this is an ?exclusion?, a written modification shall be issued that will authorize the prospective contractor to proceed with the repair at the agreed upon cost and delivery schedule.  No authorization to proceed is valid until the Contracting Officer issues a modification to the delivery order with instructions to the prospective contractor and additional funding provided.
 8.0	 SERVICE BULLETINS
Service bulletins are subject to change during the contract period of performance.All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of components requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.
Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Offeror incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851)), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires a Technology Refresh of two (2) EMC Symmetrix 8730s and the migration of all ATF Open System hosts and data from the existing Storage Area Network (SAN) to the new SAN infrastructure.  The service shall provide the design and implementation planning, data migration, upgrades to the storage replication software, and execution of the plan. ATF is requesting the delivery of the defined products as a Lease with the Option to Purchase (LTOP) agreement for a term of 36 months.  The lease agreement shall provide full installation and maintenance coverage for the term of the lease with ATF owning the equipment at the termination of the lease.  ATF is seeking to replace two EMC Symmetrix?s 8730 with a technical refresh to the EMC DMX-2000 storage platforms.  The project will include the deployment of two SANs with complete storage management features: automatic load balancing, automatic Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) configuration, volume management, volume cloning, snapshots, snapshot management, and remote replication.  The SAN solution deployed should be configured with enterprise redundancy: dual controllers, power supplies, fans, and network connections, hot-swappable disk drives, and components.  The select SAN should ensure easy and cost-effective growth and offer upgrades that do not require downtime. The deployed SANs should be configured for high-performance and multi-path host access.  The SAN solution shall be integrated with ATF?s existing protection and backup operations to provide an efficient backup procedure using snapshots/hot backups.  The vendor will migrate all current SAN connect servers to the new SAN environment with minimal to no downtime to the ATF customers. The SAN solution provider will perform the migration of all current EMC Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) and Oracle Stand-by database operations.  The vendor will utilize best practices in design and configuration of the new SANs but not limited to automated storage provisioning and management, storage consolidation, utilization of designs for space efficiencies and maintenance of reliable backups, and site-to-site disaster recovery methodologies.

<DESC>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS for RFQ 1406-04-07-RQ-68613 This first group of questions and answers are from the initial solicitation and they are still relevant to this solicitation.    Q1. Is there an incumbent currently providing the requested services or any portion thereof?  Answer:  No  Q2.  The first paragraph of the Request For Quote letter indicates that proposal must be submitted via email; in the closing sections of the Request For Quote letter offerors are provided with the proposal submittal address.  Will other than email submitted proposals be accepted?  Answer:  Yes, you may submit proposals on CD plus one copy by the stated due date and time.  An email response alone is fine.   Q3.  Has the government produced an independent cost estimate and/or estimated level of effort, and if so, what are the results of this effort?   Answer:   Yes, the government has an estimated level of effort of 14,000 to 18,000 man hours for this 36 months effort.     Questions on the RFQ letter Proposal Volume 1A- Technical Comment: The Govt has requested that offerors provide an organizational chart that includes the proposed resource head count required to perform these services. It further states that offerors are required to identify roles/responsibilities for each role. Q1.  What is the definition of the term "each role."  Are roles bounded by discreet functions that may be accomplished by one or many individuals in the organization, or is each role discreetly bounded by a single head count included in the submitted organizational chart?   Answer:  A person's title in the organizational chart may be different from the labor category proposed.  Please provide a labor category description for each individual proposed.   Q2.  The Govt has requested that offerors provide management methods and processes for "all types of support activities."   Can support activities be better defined so that bidders will have a clearer understanding of the information requirement?  Answer:  Provide only support activities that are relevant to this effort, so to demonstrate an understanding of this requirement in your proposal.   Q3.  Will a contractor's standard format for submission of Management and Status Reports be acceptable or is there an approved customer format that must be utilized by contractors? Answer:  A format will be agreed upon at the Orientation briefing.   Questions on the RFQ letter Proposal Volume 2- Price Quote Comment:  The RFQ states that the resultant contract will be a Firm Fixed Price arrangement with actual travel costs reimbursed per the JTR. The RFP further requests that offerors identify labor categories, describe skills/experience per category, proposed hourly rates per category (fully burdened including profit), and a payment schedule based on completion of work products. The SOW defines only one deliverable at the conclusion of the contract period of performance.    Q1.  If offerors are to provide their defined payment schedule with FFP values and performance due dates, can offerors reasonably expect that this submittal with the proposal will become CLINs in the resultant contract?   Answer:  Offerors may propose a pricing and CLIN structure to demonstrate their understanding of the requirement.     NEW Questions and Answers:    Q1.  Is this a new requirement?  Answer:  Yes  Q2.  Is this a Small Business Set Aside? Answer:  This is a Service Disabled Veteran Small Business Set-aside. Q3.  Will the successful offeror on this opportunity be excluded from bidding on future opportunities to support the development of Live/Virtual Training Systems? Answer:  Yes, However, the government will not begin to address performance parameters and metrics until the start of the CDD (post CBA and ICD).  At that point any vendor who is working on this task who thinks they may have a material solution will have an conflict of interest issue and should stop work or given the option to continue the work with a no bid clause. Q4.  Is the goal of the task to roll up three programs/capabilities [SITE, LVC-TE, DVTE] into one ICD?    Answer:  No, it would not be possible to roll SITE, LVC-TE, and DVTE CDD into one document that would support the acquisition process.  Q5.  Are three CBAs [FAA, FNA, FSA] or a single CBA required to address the capability gap? Answer:  No, In the JCIDS process any capability that addresses different needs and functional areas would be addressed separately.  This is not a single CBA to address the capability gap. Q6. What is the current POM status for SITE, DVTE, and LVC-TE? Answer:  The POM question is irrelevant.  The Government uses JCIDS to support POM efforts.   Q7.  Would the Government consider changing the contract type for this solicitation to a Time and Material contract?    Answer:   No  Q8.  What is the expected date of award in light of the fact that the responses are due on 4 September, 2007?  Answer:  The contract must be awarded no later than September 18, 2007.  Q9. Due to the detailed requirements in this SOW and the required responses, would the Government grant a two week extension for proposal submission? Answer:  This is not possible due to the end of the fiscal year.    Q10.  Would the Government authorize progress payments for effort expended each month toward a deliverable vs. at completion?   Answer:  Since this will be a Firm Fixed Price contract, the contractor must develop a payment schedule based on the work products and the final deliverable.   Q11.  Is this a firm fixed price?    Answer:  Yes, this is in the Statement of Work    Q12.  Would you confirm that this Solicitation replaces RQ-67950?   Answer:  Yes, this solicitation replaces RQ-67950.   Q13.  Are resumes required or allowed in support of a company's response?   Answer:  Yes, resumes are requested in the RFQ letter.

<DESC>The purpose of this amenement is to attach the revised statement of work:

STATEMENT OF WORK:
I.  BACKGROUND
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consists of a multidisciplinary group of professionals including engineers, scientists, nurses, clinicians, and other health and administrative professionals who are collectively dedicated to promoting and protecting public health.  Our unique and diverse expertise enhances the effectiveness and impact of CDRH programs. CDRH recently completed a thorough review of its post market processes.  The Post Market Transformation Leadership Team (PTLT) identified numerous issues to be addressed and developed a list of high priority recommendations for early action to be taken by the Center in order to address these issues and achieve post market transformation.  The recommendations were in the following areas:

1.) Create a Culture of Collaboration

2.) Develop World Class Data Systems

3.) Enhance Risk/Benefit Communication Efforts, and

4.) Collaborate on Enforcement Strategies and Outcomes

Under the recommendation for creating a culture of collaboration, CDRH is currently establishing a matrix organization structure of product oriented networks to complement the largely functional organization of the Center. 

As part of the implementation of the matrix organization structure, efforts will result in a need to facilitate greater information sharing and richer collaboration across the Center which will overlay *horizontal*, product-focused Networks on existing *vertical* functional Offices.  

The matrix calls for establishing product-based Networks that will include all of the products the Center regulates, plus several over-arching groups covering cross-cutting science and regulatory issues.  Each Network will have a Network Leader and will be managed from the Center Director's office by an Associate Center Director. 

II.  OBJECTIVE 
This project is intended to focus on OCER managers and how the Office will fit into the networks of the new matrix organization.  This will also facilitate discussion to determine the knowledge, skills and abilities required of the networks, the number of network liaisons OCER will have, as well as to determine which functions should be a part of the new matrix.  

In order to keep pace with the deadlines and timeframes for availability of all key staff that are needed to participate in this initiative the training must take place as soon as possible.  Due to the number of mangers attending this go away (approximately 35) scheduling issues made it such that November 12-14, 2007 is the only time that all could attend.  It is also necessary that the venue provide accommodations and is within 50 to 100 miles within the DC Metro area.  

III.  SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall perform the following:

Phase 1:  Project Kick-Off
Upon contract award, the Contractor shall schedule a meeting to collaborate with Director, OCER, to develop a two-day retreat for OCER managers at the OCER/CDRH office located in the Rockville, Maryland area.
A.	

The OCER Director will provide an overview discussion on the mission of the Post Market Transformation initiative and the goal(s) of the project.

The Consultant shall submit a draft design to the Director, OCER, for input and approval which includes: broad objectives, deliverables and methodologies.  

Upon approval of the draft the Consultant will develop participant materials for the retreat and submit an original for duplication by CDRH/OCER.

The Consultant will attend pre-meeting with Director, OCER and immediate staff in preparation for the retreat.
       
Phase 2 Retreat:  

A. Based on the approval of the retreat strategy the Contractor shall design a unique two-day retreat program and location for the target audience. 

B.The consultant will facilitate the two-day retreat.

08/22/07 Birch Bayh and New Bern Pre-Bid Conference
Meeting Minutes
Important Notes:
?	Another optional site tour for Birch Bayh is scheduled for Thursday August 30th, 1:00pm local (Eastern Daylight) Time.  Meet at the entrance on the corner and Ohio and Pennsylvania at Entrance.
?	For both Birch Bayh and New Bern Bid Sheets, bidders shall add a Base Price in the bid sheet to cover one-time cost (e.g., travel, overhead, etc.) while keeping all optional pricing as additional add-on prices to the Base Bid.
?	For Birch Bayh, contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  

General:
?	Is there a NTP date in mind? September or October.
?	Can we bid on one of all projects?  Yes.  
?	Is there full and open competition? Yes.  There are few contract clauses due to this being a commercial acquisition.  
?	What is the order of importance of evaluation factors? The order of importance is the order they are listed in.  Weighting parameters will not be provided.
?	What liability concerns are there regarding third parties?  Once a Deliverable is accepted by the Government, it is considered Government property.  If Government property is provided to a third party, that is the responsibility of the government.
?	Vectorworks is listed in some areas but not another.  Can we use this application? To be approved as part of the Post-Processing/Modeling Plan.
?	Will a list of participants on the phone call be made available to bidders?  No.
?	Are there specific horizontal and vertical datum to be utilized? Some suggested datum are suggested in the scope of work.  Contractors shall recommend alternatives to GSA in the modeling plan.
?	What is the difference between the existing and proposed condition modeling requirements?  We want to capture the exact conditions for the existing conditions, including any deformations or out-of-plumb conditions.  These may be modeled using mesh, surface models, or BIM.  For the proposed conditions that can be assumed to be plumbed and straight, a BIM shall be created. 
?	Can a firm submit just existing conditions plan or does the GSA want the proposed design with it?  GSA is open to both, but would prefer prices for all options listed.
?	Are constructions costs available?  No, we don?t provide budgets.
?	Additional Options will not be added at this time.  Option additions/modifications may be negotiated with the winning contractor. 
?	For both Birch Bayh and New Bern Bid Sheets, bidders shall add a Base Price in the bid sheet to cover one-time cost (e.g., travel, overhead, etc.) while keeping all optional pricing as additional add-on prices to the Base Bid.
?	Contractors may submit bid proposals up until Sept. 4th at midnight.  Email the proposal to Steven Cox at steven.cox@gsa.gov
?	What elements must be modeled? The contractor must model the elements within the artifact resolution/threshold/tolerance listed in the SOW.  We will allow cut and paste scanning for some approved general interior elements.
?	Must surveyors be provided by the contractor, or will the GSA provide them?  The contractor must provide their own.
Birch Bayh:
General:
?	The dropped ceiling modeling requirement for Option 2D includes the dropped ceilings in the corridor areas, not in the office spaces.
?	In Option H, AOI 2F focuses on the basement mechanical room itself, not the adjacent electrical and storage rooms.
?	GSA may desire acquire a higher-resolution scan of a continuous section of the lobby (3 Bays), rather than all of the first floor lobby to get better resolution.  However, this will be determined and coordinated with the contractor at a later point.  For 9/4 bidding purpose, this area falls under AOI 2B-interior space, are is only subject to the tolerance and accuracy noted in the original SOW.
Questions:
?	Are floor plans available? Not at this time due to security concerns.  Floor plans may be made available to the short listed contractors.  There is a sample floor plan in the SOW. 
?	Are there time restrictions or is there 24-hour access?  There are no time restrictions.  24-hour access is available.  Coordination with the designated point of contact through GSA is required. 
?	Will there be areas to be scanned where there is restricted access for building occupants?  Some.  Office areas will have people in it, and their activities may interfere with scanning activities.  Important to coordinate with GSA, who is here to assist and facilitate such coordination with the tenants and the Marshals.
?	Will the building maintenance staff be required to remove tiles, and are there Union issues with removing ceiling tiles? There are some delicate tiles, and the contractor can hire building maintenance staff to help with removal of the tiles if over two hours/day of work is required at a rate of $25-$27/hr.  Assistance less than two hours may be given at no charge.  These services are outside of scope of this SOW.
?	Do exterior walls need to be scanned?  Yes.
?	How much of the rooftop equipments is to be scanned? None.
?	Is the above 4th floor ceiling space safe to walk on?  Yes, but it is recommended that the contractor use 4?x5? sheets of plywood to distribute weight.
?	Is the 5th floor included in the scope?  The 5th floor is part of AOI 2B-interior spaces.  The project team is looking for the raw interior space due to proposed swing space needs for temporary judges chambers.
?	Will there be a problem setting up temporary targets in areas inside or outside of the building? No problem, as long as coordinated through the designated point of contact.
?	Is there scanning required inside the 3rd floor bulk head?  contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	Is there a demolition list?  We will provide a list with the awarded party, and this issue will be addressed in the scan and modeling plan.
?	In the existing floor plan is there in between floor/interstitial space as-builts?  No .
?	What are the requirements for ?preliminary findings? for section 3.6?  GSA will issue contractors with 2D drawings, GSA wants to be informed of significant conflicts between the BIM created for the proposed design and the existing 2D drawings. 
New Bern:
General:
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  
?	New Bern is 38000 ft2, while Birch Bayh is approximately 500,000 ft2.
Questions:
?	It states that there are 12 rooms per floor and 20 rooms per floor in the scope.  Which is it?  The building is closer to having 2 rooms per floor. 
?	For Option 2B, what deliverables are you looking for? Floor plans and ceiling plans? We are looking for floor plans at the required tolerance.  No reflected ceiling plans are required under this current request.
?	Is there any special security clearance required for non-US nationals?  Security clearance requirements vary widely from site to site.  There will need to be a background check or an escort.  For New Bern, a quick US Marshalls check will be required (approximately one week).  There is no need for a homeland security check since the contractor will not have free access.  Scanning/Imaging will need to take place during normal business hours.

<DESC>PH1B Modernization  
Scope of Work (SOW) for
BIM and BIM-Based Facilities Management Services


08/23/07 PH1B and Bolling Pre-Bid Conference
Meeting Minutes
General (some general questions were from 8/22 telecon but are valid for these 2 projects as well):
?	Is there a NTP date in mind? 	September-October.
?	Can we bid on one of all projects?  Yes.  Is there full and open competition? Yes.  There are few contract clauses due to this being a commercial acquisition.  
?	What is the order of importance of evaluation factors? The order of importance is the order they are listed in.  Weighting parameters will not be provided.

?	What is the difference between the existing and proposed condition modeling requirements?  We want to capture the exact conditions for the existing conditions, including any deformations.  These may be modeled using mesh, surface models, or BIM.  For the proposed conditions modeling, a BIM must be created. 
?	Can a firm submit just existing conditions plan or does the GSA want the proposed design with it?  GSA is open to both, but would prefer prices for all options listed.

?	Contractors may submit bid proposals up until Sept. 4th at midnight.  Email the proposal to Steven Cox at steven.cox@gsa.gov
?	Does GSA require that the contractor propose on every option in the solicitation?  We don?t require it, though we do require the base option be priced.  Though not required, pricing on all or most of the Options listed is preferred.
?	All services listed include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series. What is the ?support? desired from the contractor? Is there a Best Practices deliverable(s)? Should the contractor provide periodic ?lessons learned? reports or draft a best practices document?  Should the contractor plan to attend one or more best practices workshops or meetings?  Will experience with defining and documenting best practices be an evaluation criterion?  These solicitations are project-specific.  The contractor will be working with the GSA national office and informing us of the lessons learned during the process.  There is no requirement to assist us in drafting related BIM Guides, which will be undertaken by GSA?s program-related contracts and consultants.
?	Could you indicate the number or frequency of face-to-face contacts desired with the contractor? We identified the minimum requirements in the SOW.  We will be supplying the design information to the contractor.  The contractor will report directly to the GSA.  Most communication can take place virtually.  GSA encourages and invites the contractor to be an active part of the coordination with the project team, though this is above the minimum requirements.
?	In what format(s) will the GSA provide drawings: paper, PDF, DWG, other?  For PH1B there will be CAD drawings and paper drawings.  All new work will be CAD supplied.  For Bolling, CAD or Oracle database formats can be provided.  DWGs and paper plans are available.
?	Is there any expectation that the contractor will need to perform field measurements or field verification of conditions in order to create the BIM? No.  The minimum expectation is that the contractor takes the 2D data and convert it to 3D.
?	What is the contractor?s role in resolving any clashes between various disciplines? None, they shall only inform GSA of potential conflicts, then GSA and its design team will be responsible for coming up with solutions.
?	Both projects have an Option for 4D Tenant Phasing: does this require modeling of existing conditions to be demolished as well as existing conditions to remain? PH1B- Yes.  Bolling- Yes. The focus is on the occupant agency.  High precision in building elements is not required.  There is very little construction sequencing (possibly on a very high level) that is part of this scope, just tenant phasing.
?	Both projects have an option for modeling object types for mechanical, electrical, etc. components. What is the level of graphic detail desired for these components? Can you provide an example? The graphic detail required is minimal.  The emphasis of this project is on the information the elements are populated with, not the graphic nature of the elements.  The purpose of this information is for building operations.
?	What will be the basis for the geometric model? Photographs? Catalogs? 2D technical drawings on paper? 2D CAD files? 3D CAD files? Other?  We will be sharing all the information we have with the contractor, and it can come from any one of these sources.
?	Do you want parametric objects? If so, how many parameters on average? (That is, length, width and height or parametric generation of model subcomponents?)  For the Options that refer to the population of the BIMs with performance requirements, there is a limit of 10 object attributes.  For as-built data, the limit is 15 object attributes.  This is stated in the current SOW.  We only listed examples on exactly which attributes were to be modeled, since this level of specificity will be determined in the BIM modeling plan once the winning bid is awarded.
?	Both projects have an Option for modeling and evaluating as-built equipment attributes: is there any other as-built data required?  No.
?	Would participation on these contracts conflict with participation in other CM or GC contracts for the same project?  The contractor would need to notify the GSA of other roles/responsibilities/contracts that they are affiliated with the same project.  This issue will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
?	What type of contract is this?  Firm-fixed price contract.
?	Can an academic research center apply for this contract? Yes,
?	Do the objects that need to be modeled have to be IFC 2x compliant?  To the greatest extent possible, yes.  All Option A elements must be. We encourage other equipment objects to be IFC compliant as well.
?	What OMNICLASS tables will you be using?  Likely to be Table 21 and Table 23 (to be confirmed during modeling plan phase).  There are ongoing efforts here to identify equipment with the correct OMNICLASS classification, and the contractor will be able to leverage that information.  The contractor will not have to determine all of that information from scratch.

PH1B:
Questions:

?	Are the Start/ Finish dates on p. 3 based on government fiscal year ? Quarter 1 2008 starts October 1 2007?  All quarters listed are based on the calendar year.  
?	Do Final Concepts and Design Development phases run concurrently as indicated? No.  Final Concepts will be completed before DD.  In February Final Concepts will start.  The end date will be around June, 2008. DD will last until March or April 2009. The contract length is based on the BIM contractor?s estimates of the time required to perform the work (see p.9), and are not expected to last through the duration of the actual design/construction time span.
?	When will the Concept Design Phase drawings be available? July, 2008.  We will most likely have a quasi-complete set of drawings before then, with which the contractor will be able to take them as the basis of the BIM scope.
?	Will the COBIE work take place during DD or during/after construction?  The work will primarily take place during the Construction Phase.  Some information may be available towards the end of the Construction Documents Phase.
?	Will an on-site verification of the as-builts be required?  Not required.
?	Will facility, wall, space, etc. attributes from Option A need to be put into COBIE? COBIE will be used primarily as an interface to exchange data on building equipment.  Location of the equipment may be addressed.  Details of the attributes to be modeling and how best use COBIE in that effort will be addressed in the BIM modeling Plan.
?	What CMMS system are you using?   Maximo for the Natioinal Capital Region/R11.  There is no standard GSA CMMS system across all GSA regions.
?	What level of coordination is required between the A/E and the BIM contractor?  The minimum requirement of coordination should be non-interruptive.  The minimum requirements reside in the SOW.  The contractor will report to the GSA team their findings, and the GSA and the A/E will use that information for conflict resolution.  
?	Are there other models to be incorporated into this model?  No.
?	What type of contracts does PH1B currently have?  An A/E and CM contract.
?	What are the highest priority systems to be modeled? Security is the highest priority.  HVAC and electrical are also high priority.  There is a desire to capture all the major elements of all the primary systems.  A comprehensive modeling of one particular system will not be required.  The maximum number of object types to be modeled are listed in the SOW.
?	What object types are to be modeled?  Some examples are listed in the SOW.  Finalized lists will be determined with the project team after the award has been determined.
?	How can we get information regarding the Base Services?  Please see GSA BIM Guide Series 02-Spatial Validation at www.gsa.gov/bim for the level of modeling detailed required.
?	Is it possible to visit the site prior to proposal submittal?  There may be a possibility for the short-listed group of contractors.

Bolling:

Questions:

?	Base Services require a ?3D Model and/or BIM of the surrounding landscape, buildings, and streetscape? ? how many blocks in each direction? One block in each direction from the subject building.
?	Option C ? Energy Modeling requires energy simulations of the ?impacts of a number of discrete building material alternatives, building envelope configurations, and HVAC equipment or operational design options (based on the design proposal and inputs by the design team)? ? how many sets of alternatives to you expect to simulate? The modeling that is required is to model the proposed design and compare it to the existing design.  No ?design options? will be evaluated.  The simulation is meant to serve as a validation of the A/E?s energy modeling.
?	What types of contract are currently in place?  A/E, CA, and CM, and GC.
?	Is it expected that the contractor do LEED certification? No.
?	Is there a particular energy simulation application you want the contractor to use?  This is to be recommended by the contractor in the modeling plan, subject to GSA COTR?s approval.  Possible applications include ones that use a DOE-2 engine (VisualDOE, eQUEST), EnergyPlus, or an application capable of leveraging the spatial data of BIM such as Riuska or IES.

These solicitations are project-specific.  The contractor will be working with the GSA national office and informing us of the lessons learned during the process.  There is no requirement to assist us in drafting related BIM Guides, which will be undertaken by GSA?s program-related contracts and consultants.
?	Could you indicate the number or frequency of face-to-face contacts desired with the contractor? We identified the minimum requirements in the SOW.  We will be supplying the design information to the contractor.  The contractor will report directly to the GSA.  Most communication can take place virtually.  GSA encourages and invites the contractor to be an active part of the coordination with the project team, though this is above the minimum requirements.
?	In what format(s) will the GSA provide drawings: paper, PDF, DWG, other?  For PH1B there will be CAD drawings and paper drawings.  All new work will be CAD supplied.  For Bolling, CAD or Oracle database formats can be provided.  DWGs and paper plans are available.
?	Is there any expectation that the contractor will need to perform field measurements or field verification of conditions in order to create the BIM? No.  The minimum expectation is that the contractor takes the 2D data and convert it to 3D.
?	What is the contractor?s role in resolving any clashes between various disciplines? None, they shall only inform GSA of potential conflicts, then GSA and its design team will be responsible for coming up with solutions.
?	Both projects have an Option for 4D Tenant Phasing: does this require modeling of existing conditions to be demolished as well as existing conditions to remain? PH1B- Yes.  Bolling- Yes. The focus is on the occupant agency.  High precision in building elements is not required.  There is very little construction sequencing (possibly on a very high level) that is part of this scope, just tenant phasing.
?	Both projects have an option for modeling object types for mechanical, electrical, etc. components. What is the level of graphic detail desired for these components? Can you provide an example? The graphic detail required is minimal.  The emphasis of this project is on the information the elements are populated with, not the graphic nature of the elements.  The purpose of this information is for building operations.
?	What will be the basis for the geometric model? Photographs? Catalogs? 2D technical drawings on paper? 2D CAD files? 3D CAD files? Other?  We will be sharing all the information we have with the contractor, and it can come from any one of these sources.
?	Do you want parametric objects? If so, how many parameters on average? (That is, length, width and height or parametric generation of model subcomponents?)  For the Options that refer to the population of the BIMs with performance requirements, there is a limit of 10 object attributes.  For as-built data, the limit is 15 object attributes.  This is stated in the current SOW.  We only listed examples on exactly which attributes were to be modeled, since this level of specificity will be determined in the BIM modeling plan once the winning bid is awarded.
?	Both projects have an Option for modeling and evaluating as-built equipment attributes: is there any other as-built data required?  No.
?	Would participation on these contracts conflict with participation in other CM or GC contracts for the same project?  The contractor would need to notify the GSA of other roles/responsibilities/contracts that they are affiliated with the same project.  This issue will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
?	What type of contract is this?  Firm-fixed price contract.
?	Can an academic research center apply for this contract? Yes,
?	Do the objects that need to be modeled have to be IFC 2x compliant?  To the greatest extent possible, yes.  All Option A elements must be. We encourage other equipment objects to be IFC compliant as well.
?	What OMNICLASS tables will you be using?  Likely to be Table 21 and Table 23 (to be confirmed during modeling plan phase).  There are ongoing efforts here to identify equipment with the correct OMNICLASS classification, and the contractor will be able to leverage that information.  The contractor will not have to determine all of that information from scratch.

PH1B:
Questions:

?	Are the Start/ Finish dates on p. 3 based on government fiscal year ? Quarter 1 2008 starts October 1 2007?  All quarters listed are based on the calendar year.  
?	Do Final Concepts and Design Development phases run concurrently as indicated? No.  Final Concepts will be completed before DD.  In February Final Concepts will start.  The end date will be around June, 2008. DD will last until March or April 2009. The contract length is based on the BIM contractor?s estimates of the time required to perform the work (see p.9), and are not expected to last through the duration of the actual design/construction time span.
?	When will the Concept Design Phase drawings be available? July, 2008.  We will most likely have a quasi-complete set of drawings before then, with which the contractor will be able to take them as the basis of the BIM scope.
?	Will the COBIE work take place during DD or during/after construction?  The work will primarily take place during the Construction Phase.  Some information may be available towards the end of the Construction Documents Phase.
?	Will an on-site verification of the as-builts be required?  Not required.
?	Will facility, wall, space, etc. attributes from Option A need to be put into COBIE? COBIE will be used primarily as an interface to exchange data on building equipment.  Location of the equipment may be addressed.  Details of the attributes to be modeling and how best use COBIE in that effort will be addressed in the BIM modeling Plan.
?	What CMMS system are you using?   Maximo for the Natioinal Capital Region/R11.  There is no standard GSA CMMS system across all GSA regions.
?	What level of coordination is required between the A/E and the BIM contractor?  The minimum requirement of coordination should be non-interruptive.  The minimum requirements reside in the SOW.  The contractor will report to the GSA team their findings, and the GSA and the A/E will use that information for conflict resolution.  
?	Are there other models to be incorporated into this model?  No.
?	What type of contracts does PH1B currently have?  An A/E and CM contract.
?	What are the highest priority systems to be modeled? Security is the highest priority.  HVAC and electrical are also high priority.  There is a desire to capture all the major elements of all the primary systems.  A comprehensive modeling of one particular system will not be required.  The maximum number of object types to be modeled are listed in the SOW.
?	What object types are to be modeled?  Some examples are listed in the SOW.  Finalized lists will be determined with the project team after the award has been determined.
?	How can we get information regarding the Base Services?  Please see GSA BIM Guide Series 02-Spatial Validation at www.gsa.gov/bim for the level of modeling detailed required.
?	Is it possible to visit the site prior to proposal submittal?  There may be a possibility for the short-listed group of contractors.

Bolling:

Questions:

?	Base Services require a ?3D Model and/or BIM of the surrounding landscape, buildings, and streetscape? ? how many blocks in each direction? One block in each direction from the subject building.
?	Option C ? Energy Modeling requires energy simulations of the ?impacts of a number of discrete building material alternatives, building envelope configurations, and HVAC equipment or operational design options (based on the design proposal and inputs by the design team)? ? how many sets of alternatives to you expect to simulate? The modeling that is required is to model the proposed design and compare it to the existing design.  No ?design options? will be evaluated.  The simulation is meant to serve as a validation of the A/E?s energy modeling.
?	What types of contract are currently in place?  A/E, CA, and CM, and GC.
?	Is it expected that the contractor do LEED certification? No.
?	Is there a particular energy simulation application you want the contractor to use?  This is to be recommended by the contractor in the modeling plan, subject to GSA COTR?s approval.  Possible applications include ones that use a DOE-2 engine (VisualDOE, eQUEST), EnergyPlus, or an application capable of leveraging the spatial data of BIM such as Riuska or IES.

Meeting Minutes
Important Notes:
?	Another optional site tour for Birch Bayh is scheduled for Thursday August 30th, 1:00pm local (Eastern Daylight) Time.  Meet at the entrance on the corner and Ohio and Pennsylvania at Entrance.
?	For both Birch Bayh and New Bern Bid Sheets, bidders shall add a Base Price in the bid sheet to cover one-time cost (e.g., travel, overhead, etc.) while keeping all optional pricing as additional add-on prices to the Base Bid.
?	For Birch Bayh, contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  

General:
?	Is there a NTP date in mind? September or October.
?	Can we bid on one of all projects?  Yes.  
?	Is there full and open competition? Yes.  There are few contract clauses due to this being a commercial acquisition.  
?	What is the order of importance of evaluation factors? The order of importance is the order they are listed in.  Weighting parameters will not be provided.
?	What liability concerns are there regarding third parties?  Once a Deliverable is accepted by the Government, it is considered Government property.  If Government property is provided to a third party, that is the responsibility of the government.
?	Vectorworks is listed in some areas but not another.  Can we use this application? To be approved as part of the Post-Processing/Modeling Plan.
?	Will a list of participants on the phone call be made available to bidders?  No.
?	Are there specific horizontal and vertical datum to be utilized? Some suggested datum are suggested in the scope of work.  Contractors shall recommend alternatives to GSA in the modeling plan.
?	What is the difference between the existing and proposed condition modeling requirements?  We want to capture the exact conditions for the existing conditions, including any deformations or out-of-plumb conditions.  These may be modeled using mesh, surface models, or BIM.  For the proposed conditions that can be assumed to be plumbed and straight, a BIM shall be created. 
?	Can a firm submit just existing conditions plan or does the GSA want the proposed design with it?  GSA is open to both, but would prefer prices for all options listed.
?	Are constructions costs available?  No, we don?t provide budgets.
?	Additional Options will not be added at this time.  Option additions/modifications may be negotiated with the winning contractor. 
?	For both Birch Bayh and New Bern Bid Sheets, bidders shall add a Base Price in the bid sheet to cover one-time cost (e.g., travel, overhead, etc.) while keeping all optional pricing as additional add-on prices to the Base Bid.
?	Contractors may submit bid proposals up until Sept. 4th at midnight.  Email the proposal to Steven Cox at steven.cox@gsa.gov
?	What elements must be modeled? The contractor must model the elements within the artifact resolution/threshold/tolerance listed in the SOW.  We will allow cut and paste scanning for some approved general interior elements.
?	Must surveyors be provided by the contractor, or will the GSA provide them?  The contractor must provide their own.
Birch Bayh:
General:
?	The dropped ceiling modeling requirement for Option 2D includes the dropped ceilings in the corridor areas, not in the office spaces.
?	In Option H, AOI 2F focuses on the basement mechanical room itself, not the adjacent electrical and storage rooms.
?	GSA may desire acquire a higher-resolution scan of a continuous section of the lobby (3 Bays), rather than all of the first floor lobby to get better resolution.  However, this will be determined and coordinated with the contractor at a later point.  For 9/4 bidding purpose, this area falls under AOI 2B-interior space, are is only subject to the tolerance and accuracy noted in the original SOW.
Questions:
?	Are floor plans available? Not at this time due to security concerns.  Floor plans may be made available to the short listed contractors.  There is a sample floor plan in the SOW. 
?	Are there time restrictions or is there 24-hour access?  There are no time restrictions.  24-hour access is available.  Coordination with the designated point of contact through GSA is required. 
?	Will there be areas to be scanned where there is restricted access for building occupants?  Some.  Office areas will have people in it, and their activities may interfere with scanning activities.  Important to coordinate with GSA, who is here to assist and facilitate such coordination with the tenants and the Marshals.
?	Will the building maintenance staff be required to remove tiles, and are there Union issues with removing ceiling tiles? There are some delicate tiles, and the contractor can hire building maintenance staff to help with removal of the tiles if over two hours/day of work is required at a rate of $25-$27/hr.  Assistance less than two hours may be given at no charge.  These services are outside of scope of this SOW.
?	Do exterior walls need to be scanned?  Yes.
?	How much of the rooftop equipments is to be scanned? None.
?	Is the above 4th floor ceiling space safe to walk on?  Yes, but it is recommended that the contractor use 4?x5? sheets of plywood to distribute weight.
?	Is the 5th floor included in the scope?  The 5th floor is part of AOI 2B-interior spaces.  The project team is looking for the raw interior space due to proposed swing space needs for temporary judges chambers.
?	Will there be a problem setting up temporary targets in areas inside or outside of the building? No problem, as long as coordinated through the designated point of contact.
?	Is there scanning required inside the 3rd floor bulk head?  contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	Is there a demolition list?  We will provide a list with the awarded party, and this issue will be addressed in the scan and modeling plan.
?	In the existing floor plan is there in between floor/interstitial space as-builts?  No .
?	What are the requirements for ?preliminary findings? for section 3.6?  GSA will issue contractors with 2D drawings, GSA wants to be informed of significant conflicts between the BIM created for the proposed design and the existing 2D drawings. 
New Bern:
General:
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  
?	New Bern is 38000 ft2, while Birch Bayh is approximately 500,000 ft2.
Questions:
?	It states that there are 12 rooms per floor and 20 rooms per floor in the scope.  Which is it?  The building is closer to having 2 rooms per floor. 
?	For Option 2B, what deliverables are you looking for? Floor plans and ceiling plans? We are looking for floor plans at the required tolerance.  No reflected ceiling plans are required under this current request.
?	Is there any special security clearance required for non-US nationals?  Security clearance requirements vary widely from site to site.  There will need to be a background check or an escort.  For New Bern, a quick US Marshalls check will be required (approximately one week).  There is no need for a homeland security check since the contractor will not have free access.  Scanning/Imaging will need to take place during normal business hours.

Commander?s Conference Room information
The Commander?s Conference Room (CCR) is approximately 20? 6? W x 25? D with an 8? 4? drop ceiling. There are three 36? x 72? tables arranged together to form a large 72? x 108? conference table, which is located in the center of the room approximately 103? from the front wall. There is a 92? W electrically-operated projector screen located in the center of the front wall. To the left of the screen is an armoire which measures approximately 43? W x 22? D x 76? H that contains a workstation computer and a Polycom Viewstation VTC. The existing Polycom VTC system contains an integrated camera, which rests on top of the computer. The cables for the projector, microphone and speakers are routed through the wall and above the ceiling to the projector, which is a Sharp model XG-E-3500h. A speaker and microphone for the VTC are attached to the projector. 

The overall concept is to replace the aging projector and VTC system with current technology.  A diagram of the layout can be obtained from the Contract Specialist POC identified below (note that diagram does not show dimensions described above).

VTC codec must be sufficient for the room size; should be rack-mountable with separate camera; and be capable of displaying local camera view and remote site on-screen simultaneously.  Video teleconferencing equipment should support IP and ISDN trunk type connectivity, and will initially be connected to ISDN. VTC equipment should be ready to accept up to three ISDN lines without requiring additional equipment, though the room will have only one ISDN line at the time the work is performed. Camera should be able to move and focus on various areas around the conference room, and will be wall-mounted (or on a contractor-provided shelf) on one side of the projector screen (location to be determined at installation time). The equipment must have the necessary outputs and inputs to be fully operational with the other audio/visual equipment (computer and projector) and include remote controls for both the VTC unit and the computer (wireless keyboard and mouse) so the presenter can remotely control Powerpoint slides on the computer. A spare computer VGA input with A/V cables and Ethernet cable for connecting a presenter?s laptop PC (at the lectern) to the projector and speaker system is also necessary.
7.	Provide and install audio system equipment to include necessary audio amplifier, VTC microphones, and ceiling-mounted speakers.  Ceiling speakers should be multi-media quality speakers.

W x 30? D. and contains a standard 19? rack with 10 space EIA compliant 10RU rack rails. Since this is insufficient space to hold all of the equipment and allow for adequate equipment ventilation, the contractor should provide a wall-mounted rack to hold the remaining equipment. The rack should be mounted in the storage room behind the projector screen.  
10.	Route all necessary cabling, power, wiring, etc from the lectern along the floor to the left-hand wall. Cabling should be protected against damage from foot traffic by a cable protector / floor guard to eliminate a tripping hazard. Cabling from the lectern should enter the wall through nose plates near the electrical outlet so that the amount of exposed/visible cabling is minimized, and have approximately six feet of spare cable (coiled underneath the lectern) so that the lectern may be moved as needed. Ethernet cables for the PC and laptop PC, and a telephone cord will also need to be routed from the wall to the lectern. 
11.	Provide and install required installation equipment, interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, wall-mounted rack, surge protector, floor cable protector/guard, wall plates / nose plates, other mounting brackets and miscellaneous hardware. The control panel interface should be a 7? ? 8.5? (diagonal) color LCD touch control panel located at the lectern and should integrate the system as much as possible. Some method of operating the camera and muting the microphones from the table(s) during a VTC should be provided. 
12.	Install, test and align the system. Labor will include all on-site installation, assembly, fabrication, modification, wiring, coordination and supervision, configuration, programming, testing, checkout and training.

These clauses may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Additional required clauses other than those above may be included as Addenda on the award document.  
The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-7127-3136.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EDT on September 5, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.  Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement.  ALL SOURCES MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION DATABASE, http://www.ccr.gov/, or an award cannot be processed.
