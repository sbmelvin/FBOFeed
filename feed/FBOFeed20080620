<DESC><p>It is anticipated that the Integrated Vehicle and Energy Technology Subsystem Development and Demonstration (INVENT-SDD) will be performed by the contractor working as an associate contractor with one or two INVENT platform teams. It is also anticipated that each subsystem contractor would be working under the INVENT platform Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) setting. This effort will design, develop and ground test subsystems that can be integrated as a suite of energy, power, and thermal advanced technologies based on the INVENT consensus architecture. This effort will consist of developing critical subsystems demonstrations that ameliorate the risks identified by the INVENT consensus architecture studies while leveraging key new component technologies.</p>
<p>The three critical INVENT subsystem demonstrations identified are defined as</p>
<p>1. Adaptive Power &amp; Thermal Management System (APTMS),</p>
<p>2. Robust Electrical Power System (REPS), and</p>
<p>3. High Performance Electric Actuation System (HPEAS).</p>
<p>Integrated designs shall be developed using high fidelity modeling and simulation techniques at an air system level to validate the approach achieves the expected benefits identified by the INVENT platform IPPD led consensus architecture study. Installed benefits as well as performance oriented capabilities enhancements will be evaluated throughout the course of the program to show a solid transition path to the INVENT IPPD platform team's chosen platform. As a minimum, at least one platform shall be chosen by the INVENT platform IPPD team and flowed to the contractor as associate contractor data as the basis for their effort from the INVENT near term portfolio (subsonic LRS, UAV, or Tactical). Risk based planning will encompass ground testing through engine integration and flight test.</p>

<DESC>Reference No 08-38

a) The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a sole source contract to The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) for Space Control analysis, from 1 October 2008 to 31 October 2010 (2 years), with a possibility of eight additional 1-year options.  Approximate value is estimated at $3M per year.

b) The intent is to award a contract to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational institution, JHU/APL.  JHU/APL’s core competencies include (but are not limited to) designing, development, and prototyping of space systems; analysis and evaluation of space systems and space-related date; and research and development of systems that provide characterization of the space environment, situational awareness, accurate discrimination, and targeting of threat objects.

c) As a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with the technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts development supporting the Space Control mission area.   Further, the fundamental application of this UARC expertise will be to establish concepts for maintaining US mission capability in the face of varied threats by leveraging all space, air, terrestrial, and cyber elements that can be integrated into a solution. Aspects of this effort will include projecting and red-teaming possible threats, developing mitigation across all domains and across all applicable systems with the specific goal of identifying weaknesses in current mission sustainment that result from stovepiping.

d) This contract will support the analysis of systems, capabilities, and concepts within the Space Control mission areas of Defensive Counterspace (DCS), Space Situation Awareness (SSA), and space Command and Control (C2).  This contract will ensure maximum leverage of developed capabilities, consistency in assessment approach, long-term continuity, and short-term responsiveness to requirements for critical analysis that refines and expands upon work performed to date by APL.  In addition to program support via papers and studies, ongoing support includes the development of an “end-to-end” ISSA system modeling and simulation capability. This contract will permit the Government to efficiently ensure the mission areas are fully integrated and there is sufficient continuity with one contractor for the Government to realize maximum benefits.

e) The Government needs to maintain analysis consistent with the current approach without interruption and substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.  The current analysis approach includes developing and maintaining a Concept Development Testing Environment (CDTE) that provides for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)-free access for industry contractors to demonstrate and test potential new DCS and SSA products.  APL’s structure provides for a relatively OCI-free environment, critical to handling proprietary data.

f) Space Protection Program (SPP) – JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts on the emerging space protection mission area.  Provide Subject Matter Experts for requirements and capabilities studies, intelligence and physical analysis of vulnerabilities (attack modalities) of spacecraft systems, sensors, and ground systems, as well as cyberspace and information assurance domains. Provide threat characterization, assessment of vulnerabilities due to technology advancements, and development of countermeasures may include signature characterization, signature and detectability models, developing operational guidance, and prototyping systems, technologies, or TTPs.

g) Simulation and Modeling – JHU/APL shall provide simulation and modeling of selected concept designs across all disciplines of space systems. This includes space phenomenology, cyberspace, threat analysis/effects, space segment performance, operations, ground segment interfaces, terrestrial systems and their implications, cross-mission CONOPS, and enterprise-wide mission capability sustainment to include US government assets, civil/commercial assets, and foreign assets.

h) All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror’s experience and knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and architecture; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; proof of security clearances for government evaluation; and their OCI strategy to maintain an OCI-free environment.  In addition, they shall include their plan to insure separation of contractor’s proprietary data.  Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of analysis software and tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all mission areas (DCS/SSA/C2).  They must also have knowledge of the intelligence community processes, systems, capabilities, operations.    To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have strong experience with ongoing efforts and developments in space control and must be ready to initiate or continue analysis and products immediately upon contract award.  

i) All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: David Kessler, 483 North Aviation Blvd. El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or e-mailed to david.kessler.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 4:00 P.M, PST, on 21 July 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of SOCs received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC’s.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting SOC’s.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this proposed acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of SOCs for this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the primary or secondary POCs (See 5. or 6. above for contact information).

The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Contracts (CON) located in Washington, DC intends to negotiate a firm fixed price (FFP) award term seven (7) year non-competitive commercial item contract for satellite services in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) 57 Degree East Satellite and the Americas 319.5 Degree East Satellite with NewSkies Satellites, B.V. located at RooseveltPlantsoen 4, 2517 KR, The Hague, The Netherlands, P.O. Box 82197, 2508 The Hague, The Netherlands.  This commercial item contract will be awarded with a performance date of January 1, 2009, to avoid any beak in services, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), other than full and open competition, only one (1) responsible source and no other sources or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  The Agency has a satellite distribution infrastructure that has utilized the above satellites from their transition from Intelsat to NewSkies.  This infrastructure with NewSkies satellites is critical to the Agency being able to meet its broadcasting mission.  The Agency uses approximately 2.5 Global Beam 36 MHz transponders on the NewSkies IOR satellite, and has over 100 stations that are operational with various Agency services that are available to retransmission facilities that are located in multiple countries to other Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellites in the region to specific target audiences.  The Agency's IOR services are available on various IOR transponders that are transmitted and received by the same major satellite gateway distribution antennas, and must be maintained on the same satellite.  The IOR Global Beams must cover Germany through the Philippines (and in-between) to the Indian Ocean Region water, limiting potential orbital locations from 50 to 75 Degrees East, must be C-Band and Circular Polarization.  In addition, the Agency has its Latin American service on the 319.5 Degree satellite.  The Agency has also established an affiliate market with approximately 200 stations on the NewSkies satellite throughout Central and South America and an additional Direct-To-Home (DTH) audience base on this satellite.  In addition, the transponders in use on this NewSkies satellite offers a European Spot Beam to send video programming to a retransmission gateway facility in Spain for uplinking to a satellite. This European spot beam is required for backup capability to the Agency’s primary Transatlantic Intelsat satellite.   A move or transfer of all or part of the NewSkies services to another satellite in either region will result in the loss of audience, which can not be tolerated, as well as distribution systems that are technically deficient.  Presently, NewSkies is the only known firm able to satisfy Agency’s requirement for satellite services in the IOR and the Americas.   Those firms who are interested in the above must submit adequate detailed documentation on their capability to respond to this requirement in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting date of this notice.  All documentation submitted shall be sufficient in depth and detail to allow for an evaluation without the need for added information.  The Government will not accept oral or incomplete submissions.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement will be based upon the response to this Public Notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   All inquiries concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to the point of contact, Myria E. Carpenter, who can be reached via E-mail at mecarpen@bbg.gov.  This public notice is not an RFP, RFQ or IFB.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of a Business Intelligence and Reporting Platform consisting of software, licensing, and support/maintenance for development and production Business Intelligence (BI) environments.  These environments will allow developers to produce and publish web-based reports and management dashboards from a variety of data sources including Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS). The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Actuate, San Mateo, CA.  This is done in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  A firm-fixed-price purchase order will be awarded to fulfill this requirement.
The requiring office conducted market analysis from March 2008 to May 2008.  The results of this analysis support our determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  It was determined that only Actuate is able to meet all eight technical requirements to support the FAA's current development and production environments.
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.  Point of contact: Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUALIFIED VENDORS LIST (QVL)
The QVL will be in effect for five (5) years. After approximately one (1) year, a second SIR is planned for public announcement via the internet to allow new vendors an opportunity to apply for consideration to be added to the QVL. At that time, existing vendors will be asked to confirm their continued interest to remain on the list, or opt out of the list, by responding in writing. A non-response will be viewed as lack of interest resulting in possible removal from the QVL. Also, vendors may submit a written request to withdraw from the list at any time. A second update of the QVL is planned to occur approximately three (3) years after it has been created, however, the FAA reserves the right to unilaterally add vendors or update the list at any time. If it is ever determined that the QVL approach is not in the best interest of the FAA, all members on the list will be provided with advanced written notice that the QVL is being terminated.

Existing rocks at the site will be used to construct a new riprap spillway.  The size of the center island will be decreased, necessitating excavation, and the installation of aggregate base, and asphalt concrete.  Disposal areas for fill and excess asphalt and concrete are designated.  A chip seal has been included as additive items.  Optional items include different treatments for the backside of the decorative wall.  The Overlook may be closed to traffic while construction is in progress
The project is located along State Route 12 within the Dixie National Forest approx. 10 miles north of Boulder, Utah in Garfield County, on the Boulder Mountain.  
A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be helpful to determine the proximity of the project from a larger prospective.  A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be acquired from the Fishlake or Dixie National Forest. 
This project will be a HUBZONE SET-A-SIDE.
The site visit is scheduled for July 22 at 10:30 a.m.  Meet at the Homestead Overlook Wayside.   
This project will be uploaded into FedBizopps approximately July 7, 2008.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one 36-inch high modulus custom composite tube.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Launch Systems Group.	Thisrecommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies orservices determinded to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition isimpractical for the following reasons:1. The tube is a replacement unit for one damaged while in use.  ATK fabricated theoriginal part using a custom mandrel that already existed in house for the shuttleprobram.  To ensure that the tube correctly interfaces with others on the experiment itmust be fabricated with the same mandrel, which only ATK has, and with the same weave,which ATK has delivered.  2. The fabrication of a new mandrel, and trials of test weaves are costly andtime-consuming affair.	As the HERO experiment is time critical, and on a modest budget,it is in the Government's best interest to negotiate directly with ATK.Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 26th 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Lightweight Materials for the CEV Parachute AssemblySystem (CPAS) shall be developed, manufactured, and laboratory and flight tested for usein the skirt to shoulder region of the main canopies.  This effort is focused on CPASmeeting the required launch weight constraints and the required volume and mobility inthe parachute compartment. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Airborne Systems.  The lightweight Nylonbroadcloth effort is irrevocably linked to their knowledge, as the CPAS subcontractor, ofthe CPAS configuration, design alternatives and changes, and test conditions.  Materialsmust be flight-tested in the configuration in which they will ultimately perform, inorder to verify that the relevant and complicated dynamic loads experienced upondeployment are tolerable.  This requires access to Airborne Systems designs, which areproprietary, therefore will not be shared with another parachute company.The lightweight Nylon broadcloth shall be a weight of 0.70-0.90 oz/yd2, and willtherefore result in a weight savings of 25-50 lbs. to the system.  Greater weight orlower weight savings is unacceptable.  The technology shall offer significant reductionin parachute material volume in the constrained parachute compartment volume, aiding CPASin avoidance of the increased risk introduced by high pack density.  Pack density must below enough to allow for complete and rapid deployment of chutes, without damage.The approach shall be a phased approach.  The first phase, Phase I, will be thelaboratory phase, commencing with a fabric build, with a second to follow.  Laboratorytesting, to include vendor seam and joint testing, shall then be performed on theresultant fabric from each build to assess fabric potential for use in CPAS parachutes. Knowledge of the CPAS and access to CPAS subcontractor Airborne Systems propriety designshall be necessary for these evaluations.  While a joint efficiency of 80% or higher ismost desirable, seam and joint efficiency must be at least as high as 65%, which is thevalue of that of the reference CPAS parachute.	The joint efficiency must be similar tothat of baseline CPAS joints in the same region of the parachute.  A report shall bedelivered to document this work by September 30, 2008, as well as samples of material ata minimum of 4 yd2. It is at NASAs discretion to opt out of the second fabric build ifthe first is satisfies optimal criteria.If seam and joint efficiency do not meet the values of the reference CPAS parachute, adetailed analysis demonstrating that the new fabric with any reduced joint efficiencyshall still provide significant mass and pack density reduction to the CPAS parachutes,may be accepted.  In this case, the analysis would be performed by the vendor at noadditional cost to NASA.  Acceptability of any such analysis in lieu of attaining theefficiencies described above shall be evaluated by NASA.  The second phase, Phase II, shall be the flight test phase.  Materials must beflight-tested in the configuration in which they shall ultimately perform, in order toverify that the relevant and complicated dynamic loads experienced upon deployment aretolerable.  A single main parachute shall be built according to proprietary CPAS designspecifications.  It is NASAs discretion to opt out of flight testing if the parachutemanufacture is not successful.	Flight testing shall be timed to take advantage ofexisting planned tests.  A successful flight test shall demonstrate mass and pack densityreduction, with parachute remaining packable and deployable, with complete and rapiddeployment of chutes without damage.  Flight performance needs be similar to referenceCPAS parachute in inflation loads, parachute stability, and parachute drag area.  CEVtimelines are such that development and testing within the relevant system must beclosely linked, and this work shall be completed by the CEV preliminary design review,November 21, 2008.  A detailed report shall be delivered to NASA by the vendor,documenting Phase II of this effort, as well as the manufactured parachute.NASAs Johnson Space Center shall oversee this work and validate the materials testing. Each phase shall be broken into tasks, as delineated below:Phase I:	Fabric build I						Vendor testing of build I fabric						Fabric build II 				Vendor testing of build II fabric						Seam and joint testing						Final Report			Phase II:	Build single main parachute					Flight test in cooperation with CPAS	Final ReportEach of these milestones shall be accompanied by delivery of any data generated and abrief report summarizing the task and any applicable findings, with an in-depth finalreport submitted at the end of each phase.  Each of these milestones shall have a dollarvalue assigned that shall be billable at completion of the task, and payable uponconfirmation of completion and acceptability by the Contracting Officers TechnicalRepresentative.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for NOAA, Office of Response &amp; Restoration located in Seattle, WA for a direct push machine. Geoprobe model 6620DT</p>
<p>The new Geoprobe 6620DT, or equivalent brand model, will be used for continuous core soil sampling, soil bearing capacity tests, soil augering, drilling through concrete and glacial cobbles, groundwater sampling, USEPA-accepted groundwater monitoring well installation and decommissioning, and both soil hydrocarbon, electroconductivity and hydraulic profiling. It is small and maneuverable enough to be used inside larger buildings, and to be mounted on a marine vessel for near shore and shallow water direct-push sediment and groundwater sampling. It is large enough to have penetrated consolidated glacial tills to depths in excess of 150' and sandy soils to depths in excess of 200'.</p>
<p>The Geoprobe 6620DT has the capability to be outfitted with a drop hammer which will provide a soil bearing capacity test capability. NOAA intends to add this capability as funds become available for specific projects in the future. The intent is to provide NOAA the future capability to progressively verify that estuarine and shoreline soils will support the weight of the unit, when employed in these and similar environments.</p>
<p>The Geoprobe 6620DT has the capability to be outfitted with a soil auger unit. NOAA intends to add this soil augering capability and purchase auger components as funds become available for specific projects in the future. The intent is to provide NOAA the future capability to install larger diameter groundwater monitoring wells. Coupled with the direct-push capability, the soil auger will allow NOAA to install deeper groundwater monitoring wells and take soil samples at greater depth. The auger will also allow NOAA to install soil anchors with greater uplift restraint for deeper direct-push capability.</p>
<p>The Geoprobe 6620DT can be equipped with an overhead mast with winch. NOAA will procure this option with the basic machine unit. It is needed for personnel safety, to prevent operator fatigue and to improve production speed. Safe speed of operation is particularly important when working in areas subject to tidal variations. With existing tooling and the Geoprobe 6620DT, and also when advance tooling is procured for future projects, deeper soil penetration will occur. With greater penetration depths, there is more tooling weight to be retrieved; hence, more strain and operator fatigue associated with the unit operation.</p>
<p>The unit purchased must have a field demountable mast foot to allow for adaptation to site soil and slope conditions; be compatible with a standard uplift restraint anchoring system; have the same or better mean time between failure (MTBF) statistics as the Geoprobe 6620DT unit, components, accessories and tooling; have the same or lower center of gravity as a Geoprobe 6620DT unit with optional mast and winch - in both the folded traveling and extended operating positions; have the same or better warranty as Geoprobe Systems provides; and all tooling, accessories, components, subsystems must be able to be factory diagnosed, serviced, repaired and upgraded by the providing vendor.</p>
<p>The unit purchased will have the capability to be upgraded with standard demountable equipment that will be procured as future project specific items, including the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Small trailer towing; <br />&bull; Core tube, hydraulically actuated, sample liner extractor; <br />&bull; Decontamination water tank with electrically actuated pump and pressurized spray system; <br />&bull; Fold-down work table configured for core sample collection; <br />&bull; Operator-level maintenance tool kit(s);<br />&bull; Monitoring well, groundwater sample point and bore hole grouting system;<br />&bull; Tool and component carrier (e.g., auger sections, direct push strings, handtools); <br />&bull; Direct-push electro-conductivity logging; <br />&bull; Groundwater monitoring well, pneumatic slug test system; <br />&bull; Membrane interface direct-push probe system; <br />&bull; Hydraulic profiling direct-push tool system; <br />&bull; Automatic drop hammer system for soil bearing capacity testing (e.g., standard penetration test conforming to ASTM Standard D1586-99); <br />&bull; 3.25" diameter direct push rod system for soil sampling and monitoring well installation; <br />&bull; Upgraded uplift anchor restraint system; and <br />&bull; 4.25" diameter auger system.</p>

<DESC><p>This procurement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in La Jolla, CA requires a charter vessel to conduct longline survey for thresher sharks. The project is to define the core nursery areas of young-of-the-year common thresher shark pups, and obtain a fishery independent estimate of recruitment abundance that can be tracked along with fishery-dependent models of stock abundance. Sampling will also help document the recovery of the common thresher shark stock from its depleted condition in the late 1980s, since various area and season closures have been imposed. This is the sixth year of the study.</p>
<p>
<p>All fishing days will be observed by a field biologist/fishery liaison. All federal and state regulations will be covered under a research permit obtained through a cooperative Memorandum of Understanding between the NMFS and the California Department of Fish and Game.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the boundaries of common thresher shark core nursery areas in southern California and 2) collect fishery-independent estimates of annual pup production and recruitment in these core nursery areas, and 3) determine physical and biological characteristics of the core critical habitat.</p>
<p>Inshore pelagic longline sampling will be conducted from a contracted commercial vessel, with all work overseen and observed by a NMFS field biologist or contract fishery liaison. Longline sets are to be made repeatedly over late summer - early fall months in specified areas to determine the presence or absence of thresher shark neonates for each sampling strata in the core nursery area.</p>
<p>Bidders can bid on the number of days they wish to participate, if not the full 18 days. The number of research days could be increased depending on the rate bid.</p>
<p>LONGLINE SAMPLING FY 2008 (FY 08 funds): 18 days to be performed between August 1 - November l, 2008</p>
<p>GENERAL - Sets are to be made in six sampling areas (see figure and details below) for 18 fishing days total, with an average of 2-3 stations covered per fishing day. These set days can be "made at any time when conditions seem right for catching young of the year pups (favorable temperature, water color and presence of bait schools in the area, or sighting offish finning). If a large catch is made "on one of the sets, that station should not be sampled again until at least one day has passed, or if re-setting in the same area, the set should not be within 1 mile of the high catch set. Sampling should allow for 2 days traveling and weather. For each sampling area fishing should occur at 0-25 fm.</p>
<p>GEAR SPECIFICATIONS: Mainline: monofilament (e.g., ~400 lb test or similar), leaders: monofilament (e.g. 300 lb test or similar). Line should be buoyed to suspend hooks off bottom. Length of mainline or mainlines should accommodate enough hooks to be able to set approximately 100 hooks at each station. This can be a single mainline or two shorter mainlines set in the same general area. Hook size and type: 13/0 circle hooks. Bait should be sardine.</p>
<p>VESSEL SPECIFICATIONS: Vessel should be of sufficient size and draft, and equipped to efficiently conduct the described work. It should also be capable of accommodating at least two fishery scientists/observers. The vessel must have some type of toilet facility. And it must have electronics capable of detecting bottom depth and presence of bait schools. Skippers should have sufficient experience in conducting this type of fishing. Experience in fishing for thresher sharks in the study area is desirable.</p>
<p>SUGGESTED SAMPLING SCHEME: An attempt should be made to deploy at least of 300 hooks per day, or 100 hooks per station, covering 2 to 3 stations per day. Sets should be made between sunrise and sunset (no overnight sets). Hooks can be in one single mainline or two shorter mainlines set in the same general area. Sets can be made at any time (seasonal period from late summer through fall) and preferred location within a sampling area, when conditions appear right for catching young-of-the-year pups (favorable temperature, water color and presence of bait schools in the area, or sighting or reports of fish finning, jumping). Fishing depth of the line in the water column can vary (at the discretion of the vessel captain), but in general the line must be suspended in midwater or near the surface, not on the bottom. If a large catch of threshers is made on a set, that station should not be sampled again until at least one day has passed; or if re-setting in the same area, the next set should be beyond I mile of the high-catch set. This is to preserve the independence of the individual sample and to prevent excess mortality of fish, once a high catch has already been documented. Potential sampling areas are listed below. See attached map for numbering of sample areas.</p>
<p>1) Point Conception to Santa Barbara (areas 5 and 13; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 3-4 spatial areas.</p>
<p>2) Santa Barbara to Point Magu (area 2; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 2-3 spatial areas.</p>
<p>3) Point Magu to Redondo Beach (areas 11 and 4; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 3-4 spatial areas.</p>
<p>4) San Pedro to Dana Point (areas I and 3; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 3-4 spatial areas.</p>
<p>5) Dana Point to Encinitas (areas 9 and 7; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 3-4 spatial areas.</p>
<p>6) Encinitas to the Mexico border (areas 8 and 6; 2 fishing days, 6 sets)<br />Sampling at inshore depth strata, 0-25 fm, covering 3-4 spatial areas.</p>
<p>SAMPLES AND DATA COLLECTION (to be overseen by the fishery biologist/observer): All thresher sharks are to be measured (fork length most important) and sexed, and checked for tags, and genetic samples collected, if possible. Neonate -sized fish run usually &lt; 102 em FL (spring), while 0-1 yr old fish can run from roughly 90 to 120 em FL. Information on water temperature, salinity, water turbidity, color (green, blue, brown), bottom type (sand, mud, rock), bait school transects are to be recorded by field biologist/chief scientist. Thresher sharks in good condition can be tagged and injected with oxytetracycline or satellite tags.</p>
<p>Take stomach samples and vertebrae from any dead specimens and freeze stomach sample according to instructions on Thresher Shark Stomach Protocol Sheet, and also bag and freeze vertebrae. From all dead threshers less than 119-120 cm FL long, take a section 0 f vertebrae from the base of the tail from the same location on the tail base each time. If adult-sized (&gt;166 cm FL) and dead, check for maturity stage, and dissect for presence of eggs/ fetuses and egg capsules as described on Shark Life History Data Form.</p>
<p>VESSEL LOG - Vessel captain name, Observer sampler name, Date set, vessel, bait, length of mainline, number of mainlines set (if more than one), No. hooks set, No. hooks/float, depth hook placement (min and max), sea surface temp, turbidity reading, begin set time and position, end set time and position, date haul, begin haul time and position, end haul time and position. Presence of bait schools: Before or after each set, a box-shaped transect is to be made around the periphery of the area where the set line or lines will or have been deployed. While running this transect at slow speed, a record is to be made of the start and stop time, number of bait schools seen on the echosounder, an identification of the bait species (or best guess), and a rough approximation of the poundage or tonnage of each school. A note should also be taken if one or more threshers are visible near or at the surface or jumping.</p>
<p>DISPOSAL OF OTHER CATCH: With the assistance of the fishery biologist/observer, other live animals are to be recorded on the catch log, measurements collected if relevant, and immediately returned to the sea. Fishers can retain dead catch for sale, but must submit receipts of the ex-vessel price of the catch to be deducted from the cost of the charter (deducted from contractor invoice).

<DESC>This action replaces N61331-07-R-0062, previously synopsized on or about 4 Sep 07, which has been cancelled. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a five-year follow-on Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to ITT Corporation (formerly EDO Corporation), 430 W. 5th Street, Panama City, Florida 32401.  This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105, Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS), the Precise Navigation System (PNS), and the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS 53).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this, IDIQ ITT will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105, OASIS and PNS systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.   a)  ITT is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source for the three systems listed above.  As such, only ITT has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  ITT (EDO)  has been the sole developer of the OASIS system including the award of the Systems Design and Development (SD&D) Contract (Contract No. N00024-02-C-6316 in fiscal year 2002)  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the OASIS system since award of this contract.  ITT is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  By PMS-495 direction, ITT is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105, OASIS, and Precise Navigation systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at ITT under Contractor control.   b)  Given the complexity of the MK-105, OASIS, PNS, and AMNS systems and the level of system knowledge required overhauling and repairing this complex equipment and systems, ITT is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  c)  This is a follow-on to contract N61331-06-D-0019 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.  NAICS Code:  334511, FSC Code J020, SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Research Foundation of the State University of New York to engineer and re-configure the current Diver Thermal Protection System (DTPS) to operate remotely from the diver. This redesign requires a modification to the DTPS so that it is remote from the diver, light weight, and portable.  It will be connected to the divers tube vest via an umbilical so that the DTPS can provide coolant to adequately reduce divers heat stress.  Contractor support is required to test the modified DTPS with the re-configured umbilical.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The State University of New York is the only agency that can conduct the required modifications to the system and perform the feasibility analysis.  Over the last 7 years the State University of New York has developed a portable system with minimal moving parts that is known to be capable of cooling a diver. The State University of New York has shown that their system can maintain normal body temperature in water warmer than the proposed temperature called for in this tasking and they have pilot data showing that their system has a high probability of success.  No other agency is known to have a system or the experience necessary to be tested in the SDV scenario.  The State University of New York can accomplish this tasking in a reasonable time frame due to their extensive experience in this field.  Therefore it is critical that this task is awarded to the State University of New York as soon as possible. FSC Code: AN14, NAICS Code: 541711, Size Standard:  500 employees.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is seeking innovative solutions for enhanced capabilities for tactical level communications and networking for United States Marine Corps (USMC) and Navy networks. Offerors will be asked to develop technologies and products that address tactical level communications and networking challenges that require less operator intervention and provide greater and more seamless capabilities than exist in the current networks. Proposed solutions will enable greater horizontal connectivity between tactical edge platforms and users in order to improve the timely transmission of Command and Control (C2) information across the battlespace as well as supporting a shortened kill chain for tactical engagement missions. These tactical networks exhibit an essential dynamic nature and must support quick response entry and exit. The nodes on the network will have varying capabilities – with some both severely limited in bandwidth and constrained by operational and/or terrain features. Solutions offered should address one or more of the following broad thrust areas:

1. Dynamic Self-Organizing Networks
2. Assured Information Exchange

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:robin.turner@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>The Government has identified a requirement to increase the ceiling on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Omnibus Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101 to meet backorders and support increased demands as a result of Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) operations and other Army modernization efforts. This notice attempts to identify additional sources to meet current and future SINCGARS sustainment requirements. Contract number W15P7T-05-D-J101 was awarded on a competitive basis to ITT Industries, Aerospace/Communications Division (ITT), 1919 W. Cook Road, Ft Wayne, IN 46801 on November 30, 2004 for the manufacture and support of the ITT designed SINCGARS assemblies, including the Integrated Communications Security(ICOM)RT-1523, RT-1523B, RT-1476, RT-1477, RT-1478, System Improvement Program (SIP) RT-1523C, and Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) RT-1523E and RT-1478D, and ASIP-Enhanced RT-1523F. This contract is a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract, with a five-year base period and two option years to produce SINCGARS, spare parts and sustainment support for the ITT family of SINCGARS products. Also included in this contract are the following ancillary devices that were independently researched and developed by ITT: ASIP-E 19 PIN Connector, GPS Fan-Out Box, Vehicle Remote Control Unit (VRCU) & Cables, Single ASIP Radio Mount (SARM) & Cables, Radio Based Combat Identification (RBCI) Responder Box, Control Display Unit (CDU) and Ethernet Fan-Out Box. ITT has Data Rights on items that were independently researched and developed. Any interested source must negotiate directly with ITT on Technical Data Rights issue on the above mentioned ancillaries. The Government is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations at a rate of up to 6000 equivalent Line Replacement Units (LRUs) (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. The contract includes configuration management responsibility (including obsolescence management) to address major obsolescence issues. To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the SINCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to ITT to support this ongoing redesign effort resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government. Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) which supports the manufacture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawings are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations. The Government is also interested in identifying sources with the capability to produce the radio and associated LRUs, spare parts and CCAs over the next 3-6 years. Interested sources must demonstrate that they have the plant capacity to meet monthly demands of up to 6000 equivalent SINCGARS LRUs (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. In addition, interested sources must possess the necessary security clearance to process Communications Security COMSEC equipment.  Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy Army fielding and sustainment requirements. FAT will be required for all sources other than ITT, that are interested in the proposed action. Contract Number W15P7T-05-J101 also includes requirements for services, to include the repair of all hardware and ancillary items listed under the contract and hardware procured under the contract. Engineering support services are required to be performed throughout the length of the contract for efforts related to supportability analysis, development, manufacturing, testing and fielding of SINCGARS items delivered under this contract. Selected engineering tasks include, but are not limited to: 1) The evaluation of the maintenance concept to ensure the most cost-effective sparing options are maintained on elected models or assemblies affected by obsolete components 2) The update of field maintenance procedures as required, to include organizational level as well as the AN/GRM-122 software and technical documentation support, are required to be performed. Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) support of all system installations, training and field support of all SINCGARS equipment is also required to be performed under this contract. SINCGARS training support services and material are required to be provided. The CFSR support will include the responsibility to conduct in-country site surveys, installation kit development and spare parts packages and engineering support to resolve field identified technical issues with the SINCGARS radio system. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to meet the Governments requirements.  Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the required delivery schedule, shall respond in writing.  The response shall include a short introductory description (unclassified) outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production capabilities.  Responses from interested sources shall address their capability to act as a single provider for the SINCGARS, spares, and services.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Fisheries Research Center in Seattle, WA (WFRC) carries out research and provides technical assistance to support the best possible stewardship of the Nation's natural resources, emphasizing fish populations and aquatic ecosystems of the West.  The WFRC has a 50 year history of excellence in fisheries disciplines and is leader in the field of molecular and microbiology within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The WFRC addresses the unique issues of large western river systems such as the Columbia, and the challenges faced by desert aquatic systems and their threatened or endangered fish species.
The WFRC's Seattle headquarters laboratory is located at Sand Point on the shores of Lake Washington.  The wet laboratory draws large quantities (approximately 500,000 gallon a day) of fresh water from the lake for aquatic experiments.  The WFRC is approximately 60,000 square foot facility of which approximately 10,000 square feet are dedicated to the wet laboratory. At any given time the wet laboratory hosts 20 to 30 long and short term live fish experiments all of which rely on high quality process water.
Treating the effluent water is a key component to the process of providing high quality lake water to all live fish experiments in the wet laboratory.  The existing chlorine gas treatment system is aging and, although well serviced, keeping cylinders of chlorine gas on site requires Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reporting and can pose an environmental hazard.  Handling chlorine gas cylinders can be dangerous to personnel due to the potential of a chlorine gas release.  A recent USGS Environmental Audit recommended the replacement of this system with a safer hypochlorite generation system.
The hypochlorite generation system must hold approximately one pallet of salt, which is the equivalent to a four-month supply.  The solution tank shall be 300 gallons and hold approximately a five-day supply of chlorine to treat process water at 400 gallons per minute.
This project includes all activities to remove existing chlorination system, install, test, and train staff on the new hypochlorite generation system except for concrete work, placement of seismic restraints, drilling penetrations through roof or walls, subgrade work and drilling of metal pipe for sample/injection point connections.  This exception work will be performed by USGS maintenance staff.  Electrical wiring and interconnects will be performed by the USGS site electrical contractor. The USGS is aware of only one contractor in the local area qualified to complete this project with negligible laboratory downtime: TMG Services, Inc. of Tacoma, WA, and, therefore, intends to fulfill this requirement on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), other responsible sources that believe they can meet the requirement described above may submit a capability statement or quotation no later than the closing date of this announcement which will be considered by the USGS.  
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.
For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<CONTACT>Michael Fong, Fax 202-401-5943, Email Michael.Fong@ed.gov
<DESC>The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) directs the Secretary of Education to conduct an “independent evaluation and assessment of career and technical education programs under this Act” (also known as the National Assessment of Career and Technical Education or NACTE) on a wide range of CTE topics.  One objective is to examine teachers of CTE.  Because of this objective, technical support services are needed to analyze Praxis II assessment data.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  This source developed, collected, analyzed, and reported on the related data on teachers and has extensive knowledge and experience regarding the data system.  This new analysis will allow the U.S. Department of Education to provide teacher data on a Congressionally-mandated report entitled the National Assessment of Career and Technical Education.

The intended source is Educational Testing Service (ETS), Rosedale Road, Princeton, NJ 08541.  The proposed work is a follow up to a set of secondary data analysis that ETS conducted independently on the Praxis II data set based on previously published ETS reports and analyses.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Office of Satellite Data Processing &amp; Distribution intends to award a requirement on a sole source basis with University of Alaska Systems provide near real-time Phased Array Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) from Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) for Operational and Forecast Applications to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Ice Center (NIC).</p>
<p><br />The NIC's mission is to provide worldwide operational sea ice analyses and forecasts for the armed forces of the Department of Defense and allied nations, the Departments of Commerce and Transportation, and other U.S. government and international agencies, and the civil sector.</p>
<p><br />In order to fulfill this mission, satellite data must be collected, processed, and transmitted to the NIC in near-real time (NRT). NRT is defined by the NIC as reception, processing, and image ready for shipment to the door of the ground station within 4 hours of over pass. Data will be provided on Compact Disc (CD), Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc (DVD), or via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as requested on a per product basis. Products will be provided in Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) format as generated by the SAR satellite data providers Level 1 processor, and to the Level 1 preferred product requested by the NIC.<br /><br />Background</p>
<p>PALSAR imagery is a high-resolution data source capable of penetrating clouds, which enables the NIC to analyze ice, water, and snow in the Polar Regions. In order to maintain NIC's national interests in these regions, use of SAR data to monitor conditions in these regions is essential. Current technology allows NIC to create ice classification, concentration, and motion products from SAR data, which greatly aid in the production of a wide variety of ice information and decision making products.</p>
<p><br />The SOW covers scheduling, operations, and maintenance support provided by the ALOS data contractor for NOAA in support of near real-time processing of SAR data to meet NOAA and NIC operational and forecast data requirements. These data requirements include, but are not limited to: (1) the Arctic Snap-shot, (2) coverage of selected Alaskan rivers and lakes, Alaska coastal regions, and the Bering Sea, (3) support to field operations, (4) support of response and mitigation activities during environmental and man-made hazards, disasters and emergencies, and (5) processing of some data from the ALOS tape recorder. The quantity of data to be furnished in near real-time will be established by mutual agreement between NOAA and contractor, and may vary with season, changing NOAA and other agency requirements, health of satellites and ground system, and a determined JAXA allocation. NRT processing Standard Mode ALOS PALSAR products data will be up to 6 minutes per day. ScanSAR near real-time processing each week will include at a minimum the portion of the Arctic Snap-shot of interest to the NIC and NOAA, which can be received and processed in near real-time and at least one other view of the ice edge between Arctic Snap-shots in the Bering, Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.<br />Contractor Shall provide support for the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Ingest, processing, and submission to JAXA of data acquisition requests and orders from NOAA for standard ALOS SAR products.</p>
<p>2. Direct reception; processing; transcription, and staging of data.</p>
<p>3. Provide support for the acquisition and processing of PALSAR data designed for near real-time operations and possibly other satellites carrying SAR instruments for U.S. Government near real-time use.</p>
<p>4. Provide support for the near real-time data transmission.</p>
<p>5. Provide maintenance support and repairs of designated subsystems as required, contingent upon adequacy of budgeted funds to support equipment repairs.</p>
<p>6. Provide notification and coordination support to NOAA/NESDIS and NIC for repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>7. Provide engineering and technical support to fulfill the data/imagery requirements of PALSAR near real-time users.</p>
<p>8. Study, suggest and implement changes to operational and maintenance procedures that might be required or represent overall system improvements for the provision of near real-time data/imagery.</p>
<p>9. Provide the order and help desk services for near real-time image acquisition scheduling, order tracking, and scheduling of data processing.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe that they can meet the Government's requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response; all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstration the ability to meet the above requirements. In your response, you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written response must be received no later than fifteen days after publication of this synopsis. The solicitation for this requirement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 16 procedures. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated. Responses may be emailed to Jay.Parsick@noaa.gov .

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of New Mexico, Earth Data Analysis Center for production of 10-meter Digital Elevation Data to complete coverage over the State of New Mexico.
This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The U.S. Geological Survey, (USGS), Central Region Geospatial Information Office,        Central Region NSDI Partnership Office, requests award of a non-competitive procurement to the University of New Mexico, Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC), for the collection of 10 Meter Elevation Digital Terrain for 681 quadrangles in New Mexico.  This will complete statewide coverage with a consistent Elevation Digital Surface Model.
The University of New Mexico, EDAC, is collaborating with The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide the State of New Mexico with an updated Elevation Surface Terrain.  This process is providing an autocorrelated surface terrain model for the whole state.  This project is to complete the state coverage with a remainder of 681 quadrangles.
This updated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) will replace an older DEM that was completed for New Mexico 15 years ago.  The new 10 meter DEM will be completed with modernized technology and processing software.  
This project will be contracted with the Army Corps of Engineers as a contract extention under the umbrella of a previous contract.   This project would be expensed under the negotiation of the original contract saving the government considerable cost and eliminate any time delay.  
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services described above and provide considerable cost sharing are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541360 which is $4.5 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (NCZVED)/Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases (DFBMD) intends to procure botulinum neurotoxin standards for immoassay development on a sole source basis from Metabiologics Inc., Madison, Wisconsin 53719. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 325411, Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing, and the Small Business Standard Size is 750 employees.
<p>The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The National Botulism Laboratory Preparedness Team (NBLPT) requires purified dichain and complex toxins to perform quality control and performance evaluations of the Botulinum Toxin ELISA. NBLPT has performed previous quality control and performance evaluations with toxins procured from Metabiologics Inc and it would be impossible to properly compare performance evaluation results from lot to lot if toxins from another source were used. In addition, NBLPT will be developing a novel in vitro antitoxin potency assay in which antitoxin binding to toxin coated plates is measured. Metabiologics is the only vendor identified that produces such plates.</p>

<SUBJECT>Ship to Shore Connector(SSC)Program Industry Day Announcement
<SOLNBR>N0002408SNA02
<ARCHDATE>07312008
<CONTACT>
<DESC>Program OverviewThe Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) is an Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV), and is a future craft for transporting vehicles, cargo, and personnel from ship-to-shore and/or seabase-to-shore.  It is the planned replacement for the current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) as these craft reach the end of their service life.  The SSC Program has a validated Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  In December 2007, the Navy Resources, Requirements Review Board (R3B) selected the 73 Short Ton ACV concept as the SSC platform.  In addition, the Program recently completed a successful Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).  A Request for Proposal (RFP) for Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) is planned for release in FY10, with contract award expected in FY11.  
The SSC will provide high speed, over the horizon, heavy lift capability to transport personnel, equipment, and material for the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) as established for year 2015 and beyond.  The SSC will have the ability to operate in the well deck of U.S. Navy amphibious ships, operate in planned amphibious and Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) ships, operate over beaches, ice, mud, and marsh areas, operate in inland regions, ascend a beach gradient of five degrees from standstill, and transport a cargo load of approximately 73-75 short tons.  
Although specifications for the SSC are not finalized, it is assumed the SSC will have capability and performance equivalent to, or exceeding that of, the craft completing the LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  For reference, the LCAC SLEP has a design payload of 140,000 pounds, a deck area of 1809 square feet, and a speed of 40+ knots at a design weight of 344,685 pounds in calm seas.  LCAC SLEP is operational through Sea State 3.  The following performance improvements for the SSC will be analyzed during development: ability to operate in higher sea state conditions; increased payload, range, and speed; reduced crew; reduced maintenance and operational costs; and increased reliability and maintainability. 
Industry Day EventIndustry involvement is invited as the SSC Program enters the Technology Development Phase and begins Preliminary Design.  The purpose of the conference is to provide an overview of the SSC program and design process to facilitate better understanding of the Navys requirements and encourage Industry comment.  This event is intended for shipyards, boat builders, craft designers, system integrators, material manufacturers and fabricators, reliability/risk/cost consultants, and equipment vendors with interest in participating in the SSC Program.

<DESC><p>A. The purpose of modification/amendment #1 is to provide clarification to paragraph 1.3.2. statement of work (SOW).
<p>B. The following is hereby provided for strictly for clarification purposes:</p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />I have a question pertaining to section 1.3.2. Please describe the interface requirements to the Lucent 5ESS and two Avaya S8700 telephone switches. In other words, are the Avaya S8700's integrated via PRI to the Lucent 5ESS? If so, is the existing voicemail system integrated to the Lucent 5ESS providing centralized voicemail for the Lucent 5ESS Users and the Avaya S8700 Users? If so, are the Users behind the Avaya S8700's currently receiving message waiting indication from the voicemail integrated to the Lucent 5ESS?</p>
<p>ANSWER:<br />The LUCENT switch is connected to the AVAYA S8700 switch via T1 connections and the two AVAYA switches are connected via PRI. The solution that we are looking for will only be connected to the main S8700 switch. I believe the manufacturer of the callegra solution said it would connect to the switch via analog lines but my switch will support T1, DS1, PRI or Analog so this connection will not pose a problem to us. The solution will not connect to multiple switches. Our second AVAYA S8700 switch interfaces with Voicemail via the main switch.</p>
<p>C. The time and date for the receipt of offers will not change. All offers are required to be submitted by <br />25 Jun 2008, 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>D. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Visible Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging System. ***

Background:

NIST’s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology requires a microscope-mountable visible-frequency and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system able to perform simultaneous collection of spectral information from each pixel of an image.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Visible Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

1.	The system shall be designed to acquire a hyperspectral image of a sample placed under an optical microscope. The hyperspectral image shall be defined as a set (“data cube”) of two-dimensional spatial images of a fixed area of the sample, each image corresponding to a different spectral window of the collected light. A spectral window is characterized is by a discrete center wavelength and a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) width also referred to as spectral resolution. 

2.	A given hyperspectral image shall be collected in a single, computer-controlled, spectral-analysis sweep (“ run”).  During a single run, it shall be possible to acquire at least 16 bits of spectral data per pixel. In addition, it shall be possible to sample no less than 80 discrete spectral windows with different user-definable center wavelengths. 

3.	Imaging and spectral acquisition shall be polarization insensitive. 

4.	The basic spectral imaging function shall be achieved using a computer-controlled scanning-mirror, fast-fourier-transform (FFT) interferometer (“optical head”) followed by a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera, both furnished with the system. The optical head shall be designed to connect directly to an output port of a user-supplied optical microscope, using a vendor supplied 1.0 X C-mount.  

a.	A common-path interferometer (with transmitted and reflected beams traveling along the same path in space), such as a Sagnac interferometer, is preferred due to its inherent stability compared to other types of interferometers. 
b.	Spectral analysis schemes involving liquid-crystal tunable filters are unacceptable because of intrinsic transmission losses and polarization sensitivity. 
c.	Any scheme involving filter wheels is also unacceptable due to lack of flexibility.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates, the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in the field, and in Washington. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in the field and in Washington, often with little time for preparations.

This Scope of Work is for worldwide – based, for those individuals who will be available to work with OTI for short or extended periods of time from their home locations, in the field, or in Washington, D.C., performing a range of duties outlined in the “Duties and Responsibilities” sections below. Work assignments will range in length depending on the needs of OTI, and availability of the individuals selected for the position(s).  

The Senior Field Advisors are a critical element of OTI’s success in providing fast and flexible responses to key transition needs. The incumbents must possess the program, project management and budgetary skills to help ensure successful start-ups, management, and close-outs of OTI country programs. The complex demands of the position require that the incumbents be readily available for both field and Washington assignments.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

************************************************************************************5/12/08
TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this&nbsp;Amendment 00001 to the RFP 2008-N-10233 is to extend the due date for receipt of proposals, convey answers to questions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation, add the security clearance guide, and replace the DD Form 254.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement has classified aspects, and a DD Form 254 - Contract Security Classification Specification, will be attached to the anticipated solicitation and any resultant contract. The Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) in the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Prevention and Emergency Response (COTPER) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), contemplates a contract for laboratory support services for the Select Agent Programs to furnish educated, qualified, and trained personnel to provide technical and program support in select agent and import permit activities including support of laboratory inspection activities, records, management and control, data entry, regulatory support, and file management. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SPECIFIED DD FORM 254 CONTRACT SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION. Qualified personnel must be able to enter highly classified government locations in order to perform the contract work. Therefore, many of the personnel who work on this requirement will need U.S. government security clearances at the SECRET level. Public Law 107-188, The ?Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,? requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in cooperation with the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), establish and enforce procedures for possession, use, and transfer of select agents. Select agents are biological agents and toxins that are regulated under 42 CFR Part 73 that pose a severe threat to public health and safety. The select agent regulations, 42 CFR Part 73, established requirements for facilities that possess, use, and transfer select agents. Currently, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) has been delegated by the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with the select agent regulations. These regulations are implemented so that the select agents are available for legitimate research purposes, but inaccessible to potential terrorists. To ensure compliance, CDC must inspect and evaluate entities using the requirements outlined in the select agent regulations and known biosafety standards such as the CDC/NIH (National Institutes of Health) publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories" (BMBL), 29 CFR 1910.1450, ?Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,? and the ?NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.? The Public Health Service Foreign Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR, Section 71.54) govern the importation of etiological agents, hosts, and vectors of human disease into the United States. A person may not import into the United States, nor distribute after importation, any etiologic agent or any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease unless accompanied by a permit issued by the Director of CDC. The CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program (EAIPP) located within the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is responsible for the issuing CDC import permits. Information is submitted to EAIPP, as required by the provisions of 42 CFR 71.54, for issuance of permits by CDC to importers or distributors after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease. To carry out this provision, EAIPP has developed two forms for application for a permit. One form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Etiologic Agents, hosts, or Vectors of Human Disease? is used to request permits for the importation and subsequent distribution after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease. The second form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats? is used to request importation and subsequent distribution after importation of live bats. Issuance of the CDC import permit is essential in protecting the public?s health by monitoring the importation of etiologic agents. Etiologic agents are those microorganisms that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, protozoans, and parasites. These disease-causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Infectious substances and biological materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials. Organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or snails, that may transmit infectious diseases to animals, including humans, are called vectors.</p>

<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses:1.	QUESTION:  The information which you have failed to supply about the potential trips gives and ENORMOUS advantage to the incumbent, and creates a HUGE disadvantage for any company that does not have a trip history. While the incumbent knows how many trips they are able to put together (multi-load), as well as how many trips on average are inside the 15-mile radius, the outside company has no way of knowing how many or how often these types of trips occur. This level of disadvantage appears to be very biased toward the incumbent, although I am sure that this is not intended. I hope that you will reconsider your answer to #9 and allow some type of trip history. Otherwise, we will not be able to respond fairly and will assume, and allege, a government bias toward the incumbent.ANSWER:  We do not have this information.  We have provided a 12-month estimate of what the Government anticipates its needs are.  If more information becomes available, it will be posted on Fedbizopps.2.	QUESTION:  Is this solicitation set aside 100% Small Business or will you accept a bid from a system that is not considered a Small Business Concern.ANSWER:  This solicitation is setaside for 100% Small Business; no bids will be accepted any vendor who is not a Small Business.

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost. <BR><BR>Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.   This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The objective of this project is to demonstrate the EFFECTIVENESS OF ISLAND/ BERMS IN PROVIDING EROSION PROTECTION to the upstream slope of the earth embankment at Lock & Dam 4, while at the same time improving aquatic and terrestrial habitat conditions along the embankment. The Contractor will obtain fine material from the bottom of Clear Lake just downstream of the earth embankment at Lock & Dam 4, transport the fine material to the two sand berms on the upstream slope of the earth embankment, dewater and dry the fine material sufficiently for use as topsoil, then distribute the topsoil on the two sand berms to form a cap six inches thick. The contractor will then plant an annual cover crop of oats. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM (Public Law 100-66).  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990. The estimated magnitude of this requirement in terms of physical characteristics and estimated price is between $250,000 and 500,000.  It is anticipated that the plans and specifications will be posted on www.fbo.gov on or around 15 June, 2008.  Any changes to this date will be posted on this website.
