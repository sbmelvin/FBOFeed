<DESC>This acquisition is proceeding as UNRESTRICTED FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Request for Proposal (RFP).<BR><BR>Estimated Cost Range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<BR><BR>This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z149, SIC CODE: 1542, NAICS Code: 236220.  The size standard for this code is $33,500,000.  All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Connie Newell, at (916) 557-5229, FAX: No.: (916) 557-5278, e-mail connie.l.newell@usace.army.mil<BR><BR>This project involves three facilities.<BR><BR>The first facility project is to design build an addition and alteration (ADAL) to an existing (building 295) low-bay hanger facility (consists of two conjoined hangers, with common central admin support core).  Effort involves selective demolition (approx 2,925 SM), repair and new construction (approx 2,717 SM) in transforming building function to a Consolidated Intermediate Repair Facility (CIRF).  Project includes repair/replacement of existing hanger ceiling insulation, new overhead crane system  (primarily footings, control/support connections to 4-ton minimum capacity crane to be installed by manufacturer approved subcontractor), expanding engine storage area under existing 2nd floor mezzanine area (selective demolition of existing walls, etc.), floor resurfacing under mezzanine, HVAC replacement/upgrade (from outside existing unit to include ducts/support to specific spaces), modification of existing fire suppression system and mech/elect upgrades, as necessary in support a CIRF.  Demolition of outside adjacent awning/lean-to storage areas and replacement construction with new awning/lean-to.  The existing facility may have a reinforced concrete foundation/footings, engineered steel structure frame, with insulated panels and an insulated metal roofing.  Since the project is an ADAL to an existing facility, compliance with sustainable design (LEEDs) considerations, is not a critical requirement.  The facility is in a secured PACER protected fence area, which reduces need for AT/FP.  However, design deliverables for construction, relocation/protection of utilities, connections/runs, HVAC, plumbing, interior utilities, interior/exterior finishes, and all necessary features (interior and exterior) as considered necessary to yield a safe, complete and useable facility are required.  <BR><BR>The second and third facilities project is for renovation of building 584 to include interior finishes, demolition and renovation of interior walls, restoration of HVAC, repair roof, modification of lighting and provide necessary site improvements. Also, includes the construction of a protective canopy attached to building 584, and the conversion of Bldg 578 into a LANTIRN pod storage facility. This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements.<BR><BR>A SITE VISIT/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE IS TBA.<BR><BR>All PROPOSALS will be due on/about 13 NOV 2008/3:00 pm PST. The specific date and time will be identified in the solicitation.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.<BR><BR>ORDERING SOLICITATION:  Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format.  The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued.  Viewing/downloading documents from FedBizOpps will require prior registration in Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov).

The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 5) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.

Prospective contractors are hereby notified that the basis for award will be based on best value; with technical evaluation factors (i.e., strength of prospective contractors CV, approach to performing work) being more important than the prospective contractor's proposed hourly price.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
Islet Cell Distribution Coordination Center
Market Research

This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The NIDDK seeks an organization or an institution to serve as the coordinating center for the distribution of human cadaveric islets for laboratory research. This procurement will support a single coordinating center that subcontracts to qualified islet isolation facilities to prepare and distribute human islets for investigational research. The coordinating center will maintain a roster of investigators approved to receive islets and will assume responsibility to notify investigators and distribute islets when they are available. Contract funds will provide partial cost recovery to islet isolation facilities for islets distributed and investigators that receive them will have cost sharing charges for the islets received. 

Currently, the National Institutes of Health and NIDDK support a multi-facetted research program to further the development of islet transplantation as a viable therapy including clinical trials, preclinical studies in animal models, fundamental research, and provision of resources to supplement these efforts. This support includes investigator initiated research projects and consortia funded through cooperative agreements and contracts. Of relevance to this notice, the Islet Cell Resource (ICR) program is currently comprised of an interactive consortium of academic clinical islet isolation facilities and a coordinating center (for more information, visit http://icr.coh.org ). These islet isolation facilities have responsibilities for the procurement of human pancreata, purification and quality control of islet cell preparations, and distribution of viable islets for approved research or clinical protocols. They also perform research and development to improve isolation techniques, cellular viability and function, and shipping conditions. To receive research islets from the ICR, investigators must apply to the Administrative and Bioinformatics Coordinating Center (ABCC). Eligibility requires that investigators either have ongoing, peer reviewed grant funding or have obtained protocol approval by an ICR scientific subcommittee. The ABCC maintains a web-based data collection system that archives detailed information about all phases of islet procurement and a sophisticated algorithm that electronically selects prioritized investigator users to receive islets. In the past five years the ICR has distributed more than 100 million islet equivalents for research studies, and growing needs from the research community are projected. The information gained from fundamental islet research should greatly enhance the current understanding of human islet function and enable transplantation and other therapies for treating diabetes. 

The objective of this forthcoming procurement is to establish a successor coordinating center to the ICR in order to continue providing human islet availability following the conclusion of the ICR project period on July 31, 2009. The NIDDK plans to support a contract for islet distribution for laboratory research to accomplish the following objectives in an efficient and cost effective manner:

1.	Receive requests for islet applications, qualify investigator recipients, and process these data to maintain a complete and continuously updated electronic roster of approved investigator users and their projected needs. For purposes of this solicitation, the 2008 roster lists 147 investigators who estimate their annual research needs to exceed 30 million IEQ per year.

2.	Solicit and qualify potential islet production centers with respect to cGMP certification, assure quality performance standards of prepared islets, provide training for standardized distribution protocols, subcontract to appropriate facilities to provide islets for laboratory research, and adjust these subcontracts as warranted.

Solicitation and Qualification of Islet Production Centers: Islets will be sourced from islet production facilities in two ways. The first method of sourcing will utilize NIH-sponsored clinical islet transplantation trials in North America that include the University of Miami, University of Minnesota, University of Edmonton, University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northwestern University. These institutions comprise the NIH-funded Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CITR) and are in the midst of initiating a series of clinical islet transplantation protocols. Due to the complexities of the islet production process, it is anticipated that only 50% of the isolations attempted will have suitable yield and quality required for clinical use. Islets purified with the intent of clinical use but not used for clinical transplantation, if sufficiently viable, will be salvaged and shipped for research.

The second source will be from one or more subcontract site. Because the timing and quantity of clinical islet transplantation activity is unpredictable, NIDDK anticipates that islet production will also be solicited from one or more specific site to assure an availability continuum. The process by which subcontracted facilities are selected will be open, subject to independent peer review, and will follow a general announcement. The Contractor, in conjunction with the approval of the NIDDK Project Officer and an External Evaluation Committee, shall design and distribute the announcement and organize the review of candidate facilities.

3.	Develop and maintain an electronic communication system that will monitor and match islet availability from production sites with user requirements and will notify production sites of need for islets and users of availability.    

4.	Develop and maintain financial records of reimbursements to the islet production facilities and receivables, and house the consolidated database of approved islet production facilities and investigators.

5.	Maintain accurate records of islet shipments from production sites to islet recipients including quantities and batch release characteristics of islets shipped as assessed by production sites and recipients. Establish subcontracts with commercial carriers for overnight shipping of islets between multiple sites, domestic or international, in accordance with Standard Industry Practice, FDA Requirements, approved Standard Operating Procedures, city, state, and/or Federal regulations, and any special instructions given. Analyze trends in demand for islets and project future requirements for islets. 

6.	Collect information on performance site islet quality and investigator user satisfaction and analyze these respective data so that processes and quality can be improved.

7.	Compile evidence of scientific progress attributable to human islet distribution as shown by publications and other tangible results.

8.	Maintain an External Evaluation Committee (EEC) of advisors to guide development and improvement of the resource and support the technical and administrative functions including subcontracts as determined by the Project Officer and External Evaluation Committee. It is anticipated that the EEC will have membership of four to six non-Federal members and will conduct direct meetings at least annually.

Potential offerors must demonstrate familiarity, capability, and experience working with the medical research community as it relates to islet cell research. This includes: communicating with islet production facilities and research investigators; working with NIDDK to develop, implement, and monitor batch release and quality performance standards used by islet production facilities; providing specifications and training to production facilities in matters of handling, packaging, marking, and shipping islets in accordance with ICR, Federal, and other guidelines and requirements; and developing and maintaining documentation to assess the suitability and success of the islets that are used in the various research investigations. 

Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:

(a)	Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities, however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.     

(b)	The capability statement should include references, key personnel, and any teaming arrangements needed to fulfill the requirements. It must identify the responders small business type and size.

The firewalls are compatible with all directly connecting equipment and are essential to continued operations. As this is a brand name justification, no one contractors unique qualifications have been cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by rand name herein have been determined to be the only products that satisfy the Departments requirements.<BR><BR>
