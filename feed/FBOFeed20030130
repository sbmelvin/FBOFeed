Review and provide independent information and expertise to the NASA Administrator regarding the Orbital Space Plane Vehicle's X37 flight demonstration vehicle. 3.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/HQ intends to purchase these services from Dr. Daniel Mulville under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA-03-02-FH) con= stitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional informatio= n is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitatio= n regarding this notice be issued, requests for the same will be disregarde= d.=20 INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquis= ition Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the=  contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and D= evelopment Activity (ARDA), is issuing a BAA to solicit research proposals = addressing innovative solutions to mitigate the insider threat to Intellige= nce Community systems and networks.  Multiple awards are anticipated. Typic= al periods of performance for a base contract will be 12 to 24 months, with=  the possibility of option years including final reports and/or demonstrati= ons. Individual awards for a base contract are expected to be in the range = of $500K to $750K with possible option year awards bringing the total to in=  excess of one million ($1M) dollars.  Awards totaling up to five million d= ollars ($5M) over two years are expected from this BAA.  ARDA intends to re= lease other BAA's in the future that will address related topics. Informati= on in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) tha= t provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas,=  multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and=  selection criteria.  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.n= bc.gov/insider.cfm.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic = mail, or official mail.  Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interio= r, Fort Huachuca by email to Gloria_M_Golden@nbc.gov or call 520-538-0411. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  The Advanced Research and Development Activity seeks i= nnovative solutions to mitigate the insider threat to Intelligence Communit= y systems and networks.   Defending against an insider who attempts to abus= e his computer privileges is one of the most critical problems facing the I= NFOSEC (Information Security) segment of the Intelligence Community (IC), b= ecause the damage that can be inflicted is potentially catastrophic.=20 ARDA defines insider threat as the potential damage to the interests of an = organization done by a person regarded as loyally working for or on behalf = of the organization.  The insider threat scope, in the context of this soli= citation, is limited to threats posed to assets within automated informatio= n systems (computer systems and their networks).  Within such a computing e= nvironment, an organization's interests can be embodied in both implicit an= d explicit security policies.  Therefore, insider threat can be more narrow= ly defined as the potential violation of system security policy by an autho= rized user.  Although policy violations can be the result of carelessness o= r accident, the core concern within this context is behavior driven by deli= berate and intended actions, e.g., malicious exploitation or destruction of=  data. The degree of sophistication of an insider can vary greatly, from novice to=  someone possessing significant skill and experience.  Similarly, the privi= leges that an insider can possess may range from those of a normal user to = powers of a system administrator applicable across most of a computing envi= ronment.  Note that this solicitation limits the definition of insider thre= at to human users.  It does not include malicious software that has made it= s way into an organization's network and systems, unless that software was = introduced by a member of the organization (the threatening "insider"). This BAA focuses on one aspect of the insider threat problem: document cont= rol.  We select this application domain to create focus and to highlight it= s particular importance and relevance to the Intelligence Community.  Such = focus will allow concentrated effort on a smaller part of a difficult probl= em and might allow specialized approaches that could be overlooked in a sea= rch for generic approaches to the insider threat problem. =20 =09 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:  Proposals are invited for innovative demonstrable docu= ment control solutions to mitigate the insider threat.  This solicitation s= eeks technologies that will advance the state of the art.  Commercial techn= ology may be leveraged wherever possible, but efforts that are largely engi= neering in nature or that represent incremental improvements to existing ca= pabilities will not be funded.  However, teaming arrangements formed betwee= n those with products or advanced prototypes and those in the research comm= unity are encouraged. =20 =09 Technologies sought under this solicitation must be highly resistant to sub= version or circumvention by a sophisticated insider.  Respondents must demo= nstrate confidence in the effectiveness of their solution to resist attack = through assurance arguments that address techniques, processes, methodologi= es, etc. they have employed. =20 Regardless of specific technology employed, successful document control sol= utions will demonstrate several basic desirable features: =B7=09Ease of Use:  User interfaces should be easy to use and be free of in= ternal complexities.  Complexity in the user interface fosters disuse and/o= r potential security breaching work-arounds. =B7=09Operational Transparency:  Solutions should minimize the visibility o= f document protection and tracking mechanisms, thereby complicating user fo= rmulation of breaching strategies. =B7=09Portability:  Document protection should be effective across a broad = spectrum of platforms and technologies within the insider environment, e.g.= , XML-based web services, client-server, wireless environments, etc. =B7=09Agility:  Solutions should be capable of dynamically accommodating a = potentially fast-changing security environment, including changes to threat=  conditions, mission imperatives and personnel status. =20 =B7=09Self-Protection: Although ARDA recognizes the inherent security inter= dependencies among various system components (applications, services, kerne= l-level processing, etc.), solutions should be as self-protecting as possib= le to minimize their dependency on external components. ARDA understands that applications such as document control rest on infrast= ructures that include middleware, operating systems, hardware devices and n= etwork services.  In turn, the assurance arguments for the viability of any=  approach for the application domain rest on the assurance argument for the=  properties of the underlying infrastructure.  While this solicitation is n= ot interested in general research on infrastructure security mechanisms, we=  do seek advancement in infrastructure mechanisms that support the preventi= on, detection, and recovery from attacks against the document control syste= m application and the underlying system supporting that document control sy= stem. =20 TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREAS:  This BAA solicits proposals in three topic a= reas:  (1) Trustworthy Document Control, (2) Infrastructure Support and (3)=  Modeling the Insider.  Proposals that address topic areas outside the thre= e, listed below, will be considered, but must address the basic concerns fo= r document control to mitigate insider threat as articulated in this BAA.  = Proposals unresponsive to these areas of interest will not be fully evaluat= ed.  A brief description of each research area is as follows: 1.  Trustworthy Document Control:  ARDA seeks research that culminates in t= he creation of a document control system with the following properties: =20 =B7=09Originator Control:  Document transactions can be controlled at all t= imes by its originator.  In this context "originator" is defined as an indi= vidual or group of individuals who owns a document and is authorized to est= ablish or modify document permissions.   Note that neither possession nor c= reation of a document implies ownership.  Document transactions can include=  read, write, modify, open, print, copy, distribute and destruct.  Other de= sired capabilities include, but are not limited to:  document self-destruct= ion, transaction limits (e.g., self-destruct after one read), man-in-the-lo= op (semi-automatic) capability for selected transactions. =B7=09Audit and Tracking:  Evidence of any document transaction, both succe= ssful and unsuccessful, must be recorded to the granularity of individual u= sers and document instances.  Capabilities will also support real time audi= t, post-compromise forensic analysis, and the status of a specific document=  of interest, e.g., number and location of document instances, current perm= ission set, number and type of transactions, etc. Component technologies that would be used to produce such a document contro= l system, such as cryptographic subsystems, are welcome as proposals, but i= ntegrated solutions are preferred.  Whether component or integrated system = is proposed, a convincing assurance argument must be made that the system w= ill achieve the protection properties sought.  Proposals will be judged not=  only on the basis of the claimed effectiveness of the technology and mecha= nisms created but also by the level of assurance that is claimed, through t= he assurance argument, to be achievable. 2.  Infrastructure Support:  ARDA seeks research into technology and mechan= isms that support the creation of protected applications such as the docume= nt control system described in the first part of the solicitation.  Mechani= sms that detect, prevent or recover from attacks on the application or the = infrastructure itself are sought.  We are particularly interested in reusab= le building block, assurable mechanisms that support the development of con= trolled applications that help thwart insider attacks.  Desired capabilitie= s include: =B7=09Tamper resistance of security controls and audit functions =B7=09Integrity of associated document processes, data, and metadata =B7=09Strong persistent authentication for all accesses (e.g., biometrics) =B7=09Ensuring least privilege in granting permissions =B7=09Policy translation techniques =B7=09Policy configurable design=20 =B7=09Dynamic updating of document permissions =B7=09Effective document removal (e.g., not physically recoverable once per= mission revoked) 3.  Modeling The Insider:  ARDA seeks models of insider behavior that captu= re both authorized and unauthorized activity. For example, such models shou= ld include techniques, processes, methodologies, etc. that have been employ= ed during previous attacks. Models should be able to rank potential risks, = given a value of each document that can be targeted by a given method. Thes= e models should combine such capabilities in a way that can assess likely t= arget documents and hypothesize opportunistic periods and/or scenarios for = compromise. Such a model should be extensible to allow addition of data and=  evaluation/modeling processes.  The models shall be constructed to be usef= ul to detect unauthorized activity and to predict the course of a multi-sta= ge attack so as to inform appropriate defensive actions. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  See the Proposer Information Pamphlet (= PIP) which provides preparation and submission instructions for proposals. =  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/insider.cfm PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM, Mountain Stan= dard Time, 15 Apr 2003 to the Department of the Interior, National Business=  Center, Acquisition Support Division, Southwest Branch, Post Office Box 12= 924, ATTN: BAA (G.

A - SUPER-HIGH EFFICIENCY DIODE SOURCES (SHEDS), SOL BAA 03-10, DUE 031703, POC C. MARTIN STICKLEY, PH.D., DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206

  
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of extremely high efficiency diode bars for pumping solid-state lasers.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in semiconductor diode laser bar efficiency.  Simple, evolutionary changes to current fabrication techniques will not in all likelihood result in the efficiency improvement being sought.

Additional information on this technology area is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-10, Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards are expected to be made during the middle part of calendar year 2003.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site--https://www.davincinetbook.com/sheds/--has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is C. Martin Stickley Ph.D., fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: mstickley@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 03-10, Super-High Efficiency Diode Sources (SHEDS), Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on extremely high efficiency diode sources, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and nine (9) hard copies and an electronic copy of the proposal (PDF (preferred)), or MS-Word readable on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-10, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended).  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-10) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, March 17, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-10 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in extremely high efficiency diode sources. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-10.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.


EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA  19101, ATTN:  DPSC-POL.  Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.  (b) The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below.  (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples).  In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory.  For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.  (c) The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC-POL #215-737-7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing.  If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL.  In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.  (d) If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal.  The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period.  The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

<DESC>NA This award will be sole source to ILC Manufactured Products Division for a quantity of 2,392, M40A1 (Field Mask) (L), NSN: 4240-01-370-3823, Part Number: 5-1-2740-30 and a quantity of 2,500, M42A2 (Vehicle Mask) Chemical-Biological (CB) masks (L), NSN: 424 0-01-413-4102, Part Number: 5-1-3328-30.  The M40A1/M42A2 CB Masks protect face, eyes, and lungs from field concentrations of chemical-biological agents, toxins, and radioactive fallout particles.  A mask consists of a silicone rubber facepiece with a filt er canister.  The facepeice is equipped with front and side voicemitters, drink tube, and eye lenses.  Clear and neutral gray outserts protect the eye lenses and reduce glare and lens fogging.  A hood, not permanently attached to the facepiece, provides pr otection of the head and neck.  A canvas carrier is provided with each mask for storing and carrying the mask and its accessories.  A waterproof bag is provided for temporary storage of the facepiece when required by climate and mission.  A faceform holds the facepiece in proper shape when stored longer than 30 days.  The mask is issued in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In addition to the preceding, the M42A2 facepiece is connected to a filter canister (with carrier) or directly to the vehicle coll ective protection equipment by a corrugated hose.  A microphone and cable mounted to the facepiece allows interface with the vehicle communication system.  The silicone rubber facepiece fits closely against the face to form a seal. Air enters the canister and passes through an air deflector into the eye area of the facepiece.  The canister (screwed on to either the left or right side of the facepiece) filters out the CB agents, toxins, and radioactive particles.  From the eye area, air enters a nosecup and is inhaled through the nosecup valves.  Exhaled air passes through the nosecup area and is expelled through an outlet valve.  Outserts are fitted with a rubber ring, which hold them securely to the facepiece eye lenses.  Optical inserts, available by medic al prescription, are required for personnel who must wear glasses.  The mask does not protect the wearer from ammonia or carbon monoxide.  It is not effective where the amount of oxygen in the air is too low to support life.  This notice is for subcontracting purposes only.

<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, 412-386-5879, bonnie.dowdell@netl.doe.gov;Bonnie Dowdell, Contract Specialist, 412-386-5879, bonnie.dowdell@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy announces that it intends to conduct a competitive Program Solicitation, DE-PS26-03NT41635, and award financial assistance (Cooperative Agreements) for the program entitled ?Energy Efficient Building Equipment and Envelope Technologies IV.?  Through this solicitation, the DOE/NETL seeks applications on behalf of the Office of Building Technology Programs in DOE?s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) for innovative technologies that have the potential for significant energy savings in residential and commercial buildings.  DOE is seeking to support projects that are advancing energy efficient equipment, envelope and whole building technologies.  Specifically, the objective of the solicitation is to accelerate high-payoff technologies that, because of their risk, are unlikely to be developed in a timely manner without a partnership between industry and the Federal government. DOE/NETL intends to select a group of projects programmatically balanced with respect to: 1) technology category (equipment end uses, envelopes and whole buildings); 2) building type (residential and/or commercial); and 3) time of commercialization (short-term or long-term market potential of the technology).  The solicitation will cover research and development on materials, components and systems applicable to both residential and commercial buildings.  The solicitation will not support demonstration projects to deploy the technology on a large scale but will support proof of concept projects. The research and development areas of interest are as follows: Whole Buildings ? Building Performance and Zero Energy; Lighting ? Light Sources and Ballasts, Lighting Controls, Luminaries and Distribution Systems, and Lighting Impacts; Space Conditioning Equipment ? Energy Conversion Efficiency, and Distribution, Storage, Control and System Integration; Building Envelope? Building Materials and Envelope Systems, and Windows; and Appliances. The solicitation covers research in four technology maturation stages: Technology Maturation Stage 2 involves applied research; Technology Maturation Stage 3 involves exploratory development (non-specific applications and bench-scale testing); Technology Maturation Stage 4 involves advanced development (specific applications and bench-scale testing); and Maturation Stage 5 involves engineering development (pilot-scale and/or field testing). For projects spanning more than one maturation stage, continuation decision points will be inserted at the completion of each stage.  Multiple awards (8 - 12) are expected regardless of the technology maturation stage(s) proposed. It is DOE?s desire to encourage the widest participation, including the involvement of small business concerns and small disadvantaged business concerns.  In order to gain the necessary expertise to review applications, non-Federal personnel may be used as evaluators or advisors in the evaluation of applications, but will not serve as members of the technical evaluation team.  This particular program is covered by Section 3001 and 3002 of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), 42 U.S.C. 13542 for financial assistance awards. EPAct 3002 requires a cost share commitment of at least 20 percent from non-Federal sources for research and development projects.  It is anticipated that $16,000,000 in federal funding will be available however, not all of the necessary funds are currently available for this solicitation; the Government?s obligation under any cooperative agreement awarded is contingent upon the availability of appropriated FY 2003 funds. The solicitation will be available on the "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) webpage located at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about February 28, 2003. Once released, the solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page.  At this Internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit an application. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.  Telephone requests, written requests, E-mail requests, or facsimile requests for a copy of the solicitation package will not be accepted and/or honored.  Applications must be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions and forms contained in the solicitation.  The actual solicitation document will allow for requests for explanation and/or interpretation.  However, all questions relating to the solicitation must be submitted electronically through IIPS. All responses to questions, as well as all amendments to the solicitation, will be released on the IIPS homepage.

Task 1 encompasses all initial management and review tasks, including overall project quality control, reporting, and preparing and updating the RIMG/OMB Forms Clearance package for submission.  Task 2 involves establishing a Technical Review Panel that will advise the contractor on issues related to postsecondary education and the conduct of IPEDS.  Task 3 involves updating the web-based data collection system software for each of the three data collections (fall/winter/spring) within each survey cycle.  Task 4 includes activities related to training IPEDS coordinators and respondents and dissemination of information for each survey cycle.  Task 5 includes the conduct of each of the three data collections within each survey cycle, involving communications with CEOs, keyholders, and coordinators, supporting keyholders and coordinators with a help desk, assisting institutions without adequate web resources, prompting nonrespondents, and conducting a data quality review and migration to the Peer Analysis System.  Task 6 includes preparing imputations, data file development, methodology reporting, creation of derived variables, updating IPEDS COOL, and a short descriptive ED Tab report for each of the three data collections within each survey cycle.  Task 7 includes presenting at national conferences to provide information and additional training workshops as needed. Each of tasks 2 through 7 relate to work required during each survey cycle.
 
IPEDS shall be funded as a 60-month contract, with an option for an additional 60 months.  Note that the Draft Statement of Work for this requirement was posted for public comment on FedBizOpps under Reference Number ERN030006.

Contractors are also requested to identify if they have other designated size standards besides HUBZone (i.e. Woman Owned, 8(a), Disabled Veteran, etc.).   Contractors are advised that in order to receive an award, they must be listed in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) database; failure to register will disqualify a contractor from award should the contractor be selected and not registered.  Contractors may register via the Internet CCR website at www.ccr.gov.  Site visit information will be provided in the bid package; prime contractors, subcontractors and/or suppliers may attend the site visit.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Air Force Reserves.  The response date cited above is an estimate, not an actual.  This notice does not obligate the government to award a contract nor does it obligate the government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, 32407-7001 intends to award a Purchase Order to Aydin Displays, c/o EMA, One Riga Lane, Birdsboro, PA. 19508-1303, on a sole source basis, for 3 each RFP/18T Flat Panel Display, part number 356-7007-503, and 3 each Rack Mount Kit, part number 354-7014-502. These displays/mounts are part of the LHA 5 IFFCS System. The IFFCS System is an existing, Fleet fielded, shock-qualified system. As part of the IFFCS System, these Displays/Mounts have been tested and meet all shock requirements. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition because no other Displays/Mounts can be used without successfully passing the required shock, vibration and temperature testing necessary to qualify the system for use aboard U.S. Navy Vessels. It is estimated that re-qualifying  the entire IFFCS System would cost the U.S. Navy hundreds of thousands of dollars and would take several months to complete, thus significantly delaying delivery to the fleet. Any source interested in qualifying other Displays/Mounts for future acquisitions should contact Mr. Michael Conn, CSS, Code R52 Panama City, FL. 32407 (850) 235-5750.  NAICS Code 334119 applies.  SBA Size standard is 1000 employees.

NFCB consists of approximately 39 acres located five miles west of Ferndale, California.

Its primary mission was to conduct oceanographic observation.  NFCB operationally closed September 30, 1993, however, the Navy continues its investigation and cleanup of contamination as a result of past practices in preparation for transfer of this property to the General Services Administration (GSA).  The Navy will contract for caretaker, maintenance, and repair services to minimize loss and destruction of Government property.  There are 75 buildings and structures at NFCB.  Approximately 5,100 linear feet of paved roadway must be driven to inspect the site, and 7,300 linear feet of fence must be maintained.

The option for this contract would include the exact same services as described above.  This is a firm-fixed-price contract.  This procurement is 100% Small Business (SB) Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561210, and the related small business size standard is $6.0 million.  The contract period of performance is for six months, with an option to the Government to extend performance an additional one (1) to six (6) months upon written notification by the Government.

In addition, any direct non-supply related service up to $9,999.99, required by the ordering activities for the maintenance, repair, or operation of their facilities is included.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Modification 1 to solicitation.  Question:  Is there any flexibility to layout 3 strings of 5 cells ea of standard size CIC; 6.911 cm x 3.97 cm in size.  Would need a minor adjustment of coupon width from 6.49 to 6.60 inches.  Answer:  The substrate width cannot be increaded from 6.49 inches because of launch envelope constraints.  Also, see the attached sketch showing the desired series and parallel directions for the solar cell strings.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N61339-01-R-0023, was issued in the CBD on 1 March 2001, by U. S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation,Training, and Instrumentation(PEO STRI). This notice covers Amendment A003 which incorporates a new research topic #7, COLLISION AVOIDANCE DEMONSTRATION and calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to this effort, entitled Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) Sensor Integrated Real Time Information System (OSIRIS) Program. POC: Ms. H. Michelle Kalphat, RDECOM STC Agent for DARPA.  SPONSOR:  Mr. Sam Wilson, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Facsimile: (407) 384-3862, E-mail: Michelle_Kalphat@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual point of contact: NAWC-TSD Contracts Office,  Attn: Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, Code 25353, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826. OBJECTIVE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO) OSIRIS project is essential in order to transition the small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) into the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and other DOD programs in support of deployed U.S. forces.  The Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) and Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) projects engage in advanced military research projects, which will have significant impact on the defense posture of the country.  The OAV/MAV ACTD projects goal is to provide superior U.S. military systems in the areas of distributed autonomous air vehicles the ability to provide surveillance and reconnaissance to small units. These systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in deterring conventional and terrorists? warfare on both foreign and domestic territories.  In pursuit of this mission, the program has to perform two main functions.  The first function is the transition of this revolutionary weapon systems and associated subsystems to the appropriate military units.   Secondly, the program will continue to identify and exploit new technologies, which will serve as the basis for revolutionary systems development, maintain the necessary margin of technological superiority, and provide the flexibility and option for responding to changing U.S. strategy.  To facilitate this effort, DARPA TTO is soliciting white papers (technical and cost) from qualified contractors for the assessment and development of a sensor suite system highlighting advanced technology for small autonomous air vehicles that will provide situation awareness, target location, collision avoidance and operations in complex terrain.  The OSIRIS Program is a 4 year DARPA initiative to develop a sensor suite system for the Organic Air Vehicle and will assess strengths and limitations of each sensor suite system based on actual field experiments under the following flight test conditions: under the canopy, MOUT, inside buildings, and inside caves and tunnels; and will develop and validate critical technology for understanding sensor suite system performance with coordinated use of small numbers of vehicles and degraded communications or sensors.  The overall purpose of this research and development efforts is to enhance DoD's capabilities for enabling collision avoidance in the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) 9 inch version of the GFE ducted fan vehicle and securing/transmitting information for battle damage assessment.   ACQUISTION INFORMATION: In order to accomplish this, DARPA TTO solicits qualified offerors (teams are encouraged) to submit white papers for the development, demonstration, and delivery of a complete functional prototype collision avoidance system using the GFE 9 inch air vehicle that includes the proposed sensor system package that consists but is not limited to, mono-vision, stereo-vision (visible and IR), acoustic, LIDAR and RADAR sensor technologies. The program effort will consist of three discrete phases. White papers are solicited to develop and demonstrate a functional (non-form factored) prototype MAV sensor system for detecting/sensing, and avoiding obstacles with the 9 inch air vehicle In response to the white paper evaluation, the Government intends to select no more than five (5) offerors to participate in Phase I.  Phase I will be approximately 6 months duration and will culminate in a preliminary design that specifies the particular sensor system technology being recommended to include design and performance considerations and tradeoffs.  For the proposed systems, focus should be on control algorithms, how the decision process is accomplished, integration of sensors into the vehicle, and a well defined path towards Phase II and Phase III demonstration requirements.  At the completion of the Phase I Preliminary Design Review (PDR), the government will select two or more offerors to continue with Phase II.  Only those offerors selected from Phase I will participate in Phase II.  Phase II will be approximately 18 months in duration and will culminate in a demonstration of the collision avoidance system integrated in the GFE 9 inch air vehicle flying in and around buildings in a MOUT-like environment under limited GPS conditions.  At the end of Phase II, the government will select one contractor to continue the Phase III portion of the requirement.  Phase III will be approximately 2 years in duration and will focus on sensing, deciding and collision avoidance movement of the air vehicle in tunnels and caves. The system will exploit, but not be restricted to mono-vision, stereo-vision, acoustic, LIDAR and RADAR.  White papers must address requirements for all 3 phases and shall not exceed 7 pages in length, to include all pages.  Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  Since the Phase II portion will only be considered from those offerors that are selected to accomplish the Phase I work, all white papers need to include Phase II and Phase III efforts as priced options.  It is DARPAs intent to distribute the Interface Control Document (ICD) for the MAV to those offerors invited to participate in the Phase II portion of this requirement.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  Proposals will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives.  Subsequently, offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received.  Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part.  White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board considering the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:  (1) innovative and creative technical approaches; (2) understanding of the technical issues and risks; (3) soundness of the technical and management approach; (4) offeror's relevant experience, facilities and availability of qualified, experienced technical personnel; (5) organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposal. Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.  This announcement solicits white papers from the widest number of offerors, including qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs, and DOE laboratories.  Offerors are encouraged to provide other creative and /or innovative ideas/solutions to stated objectives contained in this announcement as part of the white paper approach... Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitute the Government's solicitation for this effort.  Any awards resulting out of this announcement may take the form of traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, cooperative agreements and Other Transaction Agreements. No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of the solicited tasks for exclusive competition among the entries.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this announcement are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all white papers/proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Government intends to use non-government personnel of SRS Technologies, Inc. located in Arlington, VA as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation. Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose. Contractor personnel are required to sign the Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements. By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractor personnel for the limited purpose stated above. Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

<DESC>This FINAL Synopsis Is Being Issued To Update Potential Offerors On The Status For The Upcoming Procurement Of An Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) To Be Installed In The Ch-46 Helicopter.  PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED UNTIL AFTER THE FINAL SOLICITATION IS RELEASED.  Comments to the DRAFT RFP must be submitted in writing (e-mail submission preferred) to either of the Points of Contact listed in this synopsis NO LATER THAN 5 February 2003.  Questions relating to the DRAFT RFP are being collected and will be posted on the web-site listed below at the time when the FINAL RFP is posted.
The FINAL RFP is expected to be released on or around 12 February 2003 and may be accessed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.
  
The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS will be desktop software application, onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, Optical Rotor Tracker, Vibration Sensors, cable assemblies and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS will be the consolidation and integration of existing support equipment functions including rotor track and balance (Chadwick-Helmuth P0372/8500C), vibration monitoring and analysis (Chadwick-Helmuth 14235), engine data acquisition and analysis (Howell H337NP600A).
AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. AIMS data will be downloaded to a desktop software application for additional data analysis, trending and storage. AIMS will be user configurable to the extent required for vibration alarming and initializing aircraft configurations. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

The proposed contract will include basic line items for the non-recurring engineering required to manufacture two (2) each AIMS prototype kits, including all software and peculiar support equipment; two (2) each AIMS Engineering Simulation Systems including all software; and two (2) each AIMS Validation/Verification kits including all software and peculiar support equipment.  Repair, training, and technical support services and associated hardware/software shall also be provided as part of the basic requirement.   Upon satisfactory completion of first article testing, options may be exercised for up to 215 each AIMS production kits; spare and repair parts; 72 each ancillary equipment and associated software; User/Engineering Ground Software; 2 each Maintenance Trainer units; and repair, training, and technical support services for the preceding items.   Hardware deliveries are required as follows:  Prototype kits ? 8 months after contract award (ACA); Engineering Simulation Systems ? First unit: 8 months ACA/Second unit:  16 months ACA; VAL/VER kits ? 14 months ACA; Production kits and Interim Spares ? 6 months after production (option 1) contract award.  Upon final release of the RFP, proposals will be evaluated based upon each offeror?s Technical Approach, Past Performance and Price.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.

<DESC>Sources are sought in research and development by the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNMF) for the Focused Ordnance Controller with Aimpoint Selection (FOCAS) exploratory development program which intends to develop a next generation active imaging fuze sensor for use with directional surface- and air-target warheads.  The objective of this program will be to design, simulate, fabricate, and test a mass focused ordnance controller that will enable air-delivered munitions to select the most lethal target aimpoint for electrically aimed kill mechanisms. The three critical areas of this program will be as follows: a high fidelity weapon launch-to-fragment impact simulation, a robust warhead fire control algorithm, and an active imaging fuze sensor design with sufficient resolution for target detection, classification and warhead aimpoint selection.    A robust design is needed that will function correctly in the presence of battlefield Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), battlefield obscurants, and adverse weather.  This program will emphasize development of a robust design backed by high fidelity computer simulations and the demonstration of critical components integrated in breadboard fashion.  At this time, we are requesting information packages from potential sources on their capability to perform design and development of this next generation imaging fuze and directional ordnance controller concept. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Divisions (NSWCDD) Naval Operations Other Than War - Technology Center (NOOTW-TC) in support of the Area Denial - Boats (AD-B) Program is SEEKING INFORMATION RESPONSES from interested sources for non-lethal technologies, systems and concepts for waterside force protection against small boats. The NOOTW-TC will evaluate technologies and concepts, which may satisfy the non-lethal functional requirements for surface craft area denial.  These evaluations will be based on both functional and operational viability criteria. NOOTW-TC is searching for technologies and concepts to accomplish the following:     a.  Deter and/or warn away attack or intrusion by surface craft (non-lethally)     b.  Stop/Delay/Disrupt surface borne attackers or intruders  (non-lethally) THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This notice is issue d as part of AD-Bs final market research efforts. NOOTW-TC intends to evaluate the responses received to identify concepts, which have the potential of meeting the stated criteria.  These concepts will be evaluated in conjunction with concepts identified by previous technology and concept searches to determine if they provide required capabilities. Some of the specific factors that will be evaluated are the technologys or concepts: Operational Contribution (ability of the system to achieve the desired result); the Operational Suitability (ability of a system to be employed in a given physical location, environment, and situation.); the Logistics Impact (impact on a ship's or shore facility's support structure); and the Unintended Effects.   Selected concepts will be considered for further development.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for services and products will be i ssued as a result of this evaluation to begin implementation of equipment and designs for waterside force protection.  NOOTW-TC reserves the right to hold (additional/new) market research meetings, including system demonstrations, if necessary, with some, but not necessarily all firms responding to this notice. The preferred approach at this time is to leverage COTS systems to the maximum extent possible, NOOTW-TC is also open to alternative solutions and minimal development items with value added potential.  BACKGROUND: The AD-B Program is focused on providing US Military and USCG forces with non-lethal weapons to Deter, Warn Away, Stop, Delay or Disrupt waterborne surface threats to ships pierside, at anchor, or operating in restricted waters.  The AD-B Program is currently in the Concept Exploration Phase.  During FY-02 the program developed mission tasks and other mea sures of effectiveness to evaluated potential technologies and concepts.  Technology and concept searches utilized several organization's technology requests and/or databases.  Approximately 10 technologies/concepts were identified as potentially meeting the mission requirements. The relative merits of alternative AD-B technologies are being assessed through an Analysis of Alternative (AoA) study that is an independent analytical comparison of the technologies projected costs and operational effectiveness.  The program is scheduled to conduct a Component Advanced Development Decision Review in the spring of 2003. RESPONSES: Responses that meet the above requirements should be submitted for consideration in quad chart or white paper format.  Any new candidates will be evaluated, as have the previous ones.  New candidates that can fulfill the mission task(s) and that are comp etitive with the current candidates will receive further consideration.  All submissions shall be considered proprietary/potential source selection and treated accordingly. Responses should be no longer than five typed pages and must be received by mail, Attn: RFQ# N00178-03-Q-3008, Code J08, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Rd, Dahlgren VA 22448; or electronic mail, J08@nswc.navy.mil referencing RFQ# N00178-03-Q-3008 NLT 2 weeks after date of synopsis. Facsimile and telephone responses will not be accepted. Questions regarding this notice or information in reference to classified submissions may be directed to 540-653-2976, J08@nswc.navy.mil

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  A solicitation is not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Weapons Division is conducting market research to determine interest in participation in outdoor field tests of High Power Microwave (HPM) Devices here forth referred to as HPM sources at the China Lake outdoor test range against NATO threat targets, for the purpose of validating effects against military targets. This test program will be managed under the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program, which provides opportunities to test items of our allies and friends in order to satisfy valid U.S. Defense requirements more quickly and economically.  This test will be a technical assessment of the capabilities of HPM sources to be used in munitions for military applications and is not a test to procure.  If the U.S. Department of Defense determines that these test items satisfy military requirements or address mission area shortcomings all HPM source hardware that show effects against targets will be considered for future acquisition or partnering opportunities.  All participants should have either HPM source or threat hardware to contribute to the effort.  All data collected will be provided to the United States Government and to the individual test parties only.  The U.S. government will not provide data from one participant to another participant.  Individual participants may or may not share data amongst themselves as their own agreements and regulations allow for.  Individual participants will be responsible for providing their own hardware, maintenance, operation and transportation of personnel and equipment.  The U.S. Government declines any responsibility for the condition and maintenance of the test hardware.  The U.S. Government will provide testing at the Etcheron Valley Outdoor HPM Test Facility at China Lake, CA.  This will include use of the test range and personnel to support testing, instrumentation, data collection, and test coordination, safety and security requirements.  Targets of interest include various foreign military systems such as radars, weapon systems, C4I, and communication systems.  All targets must be functional and able to test in an outdoor operational environment.  Susceptibility testing will be done on each target with all HPM sources thereby providing a comparison of HPM sources.  Susceptibility is defined as degradation, disruption or destruction.  Testing to the point of destruction will be avoided and agreed upon risks negotiated with the owner of each target. Submittals should include a description of the HPM source or target that is being offered and any testing parameters such as size, power input, peak power, support personnel needed, etc. required for the system.  Any previous chamber testing data that would help to define test parameters can be submitted as well.   Testing is being planned for fiscal year 2004 fourth quarter (July-September 04).  Participants in the test will be considered for future procurement or developmental opportunities with the United States.  An informational meeting will be planned to discuss testing particulars after the submittals are reviewed and participants selected.

<CONTACT>Michael Corson, Air Mobility Warfare Center - Senior Operations Analyst, Phone (609)754-7609, Fax (609)754-7651, Email michael.corson@mcguire.af.mil
<DESC>The USAF Air Mobility Battlelab(AMB) plans to conduct a concept demonstration for a commercial/government of-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) system or emerging lighting technology for KC-135 aircraft aeromedical evacuation(AE) patient illumination. The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic AE missions. Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient patient care by AE crewmembers (AECM). Poor illumination, especially for litter patients, makes clinical assessment and treatment very difficult. A portable, non-handheld light source capable of individual AE patient illumination by AECMs is required to ensure safe patient movement. Large area flood lighting is not desired. Individual lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other patients is desired. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The lighting system should provide full-spectrum light of adequate power capable of illuminating a 36-inch by 84-inch area to fully visualize a litter patient without interfering with patient care and also have the capability to illuminate a single seated patient without disturbing other patients seated around them. The system should be small, lightweight and in kit form, allowing an individual AECM to carry it aboard the aircraft. The light system would preferably be attached on litter stanchions and/or straps for litter patients. Lighting for ambulatory patients seated in the cargo area would be attached on the seats and/or aircraft fuselage or would be a combination of attached lighting and lighting that can be carried by individual AECMs for illumination of ambulatory patients, possibly hung around the neck of the AECM or attached to their uniform. The system must be easily attached/detached and will require no modification of aircraft structure. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use. INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: Primary power source should be long-life battery power. The capability for plug-in AC power as an alternate source and for battery charging is desired. The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power. Initiatives are under way to provide a 60-hertz power source aboard the KC-135, so compatibility with that source is also desired. Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable. This lighting system is required for the KC-135 aircraft but would ideally be usable on all Mobility Air Forces aircraft such as the C-5, C-17, C-130, C-141, and KC-10. Through this BAA the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies which meet the requirements, previously stated, for use in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements. All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request. Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement. SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 11 February 2003. Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file. Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH. Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed lighting system (no more than 1-2 pages). Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred). b) RISKS. Briefly address all potential risks. Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors? c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system? How long will the training take? Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system. d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility. Are there limitations? e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING. State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system. What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly? f) COST. What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers? g) AVAILABILITY. Provide system availability information. Is it available off-the-shelf right now? If not, how soon can it be made available? h) PREVIOUS WORK. Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).

This contract provides launch support O&M services to meet mission communication requirements.  Services include maintaining, installing, modifying, launch critical communication systems, recording systems, administrative and public address equipment, closed circuit TV, photographic stations, timing systems, etc. at space launch complexes, remote launch control centers, satellite control facilities, and test facilities.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, development of O&M procedures, and obtaining of certifications and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of LCC services or change to launch schedules.

<DESC>This synopsis is to announce that Charleston Air Force Base (CAFB) is considering an initiative to offer access to commercial cellular telephone service providers to install cellular antennas on CAFB at no cost to the Government. CAFB has received a request from one commercial wireless service provider asking CAFB to host a wireless site on one of the base's three water towers and we are currently requesting approval from higher headquarters to allow this installation. Please note that due to the adjacent dual-use commercial and military airfield, site options are very limited and site installation will require an extensive approval process. If any other commercial wireless providers are interested in requesting permission to install a site on base without any contractual commitment from the government to purchase any service or equipment, they should respond to the 437th Contracting Squadron, SrA Adam Walker at (843) 963-5162.
