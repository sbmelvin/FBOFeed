<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. The Gulf Region District Contracting Office intends to extend the period of performance on task orders 0004 and 0005 awarded to Versar; Incorporated in October 2009 whose address is 6850 Versar Center, Springfield, Virginia 22151 for personal services throughout Iraq.  The period of performance for the task order extensions is from 6 April 2011 through 5 August 2011 plus 1 three month option.  The Gulf Region District is responsible for project management, procurement and/or administration of construction, services and other activities under different programs. The services are for personal services from local national (LN) engineering and technical support staff.  All services performed under these task orders will continue to be performed in Iraq. LNs are able to speak Arabic and interact with the construction contractors, who are predominantly Iraqi.  LNs are able to access project sites more readily with less expense for security and thus able to support the GRD reconstruction mission.

Those offerors submitting a quote shall include a capability statement clearly showing the offeror can provide from 80 to 100 fully vetted and badged Iraqi local national personnel capable of performing the required services by 6 April 2011 which is the start of the period of performance.
