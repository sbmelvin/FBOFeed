<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) operates and maintains a complex ground system to support its environmental satellite system. The system includes two Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops Station, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska; a National Satellite Operations Center (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland; a product producing and distribution facility at Suitland/Camp Springs, Maryland; the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and the National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder Colorado.

Because of changes in spacecraft instrumentation, a succession of new spacecraft series and the never ending process of aging ground equipment, NESDIS is in a perpetual state of renewing, upgrading, and, in general, improving its data acquisition and satellite control system. These factors require, in addition to the constant effort to upgrade the system performance, a very intensive periodic effort of equipment refurbishment and replacement with the inherent problems associated with installation and integration. Consequently, contractor support is required to ensure timely implementation of the upgrading of ground equipment.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-20.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SSSAB) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order with Yale University,Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Biochemical Engineering to collaborate with NIH/NIMH to perform and oversee the TKM processing in NIH Pet images of the brain tissue radioactivity acquired by the scanner software must be converted into physiologically meaningful images in which the component values are translated into quantitiative measures of parameters such as receptor concentration, blood flow using the process of TKM. The application of TKM constitutes a complex set of operations that typically depend upon the involvement, oversight and quality control of a physicist/chemical engineer who has received highly specialized training and experience in implementing TKM for a variety of PET radioligands. The NIMH IRP Section on Neuroimaging in Mood and Anxiety Disorders (SNMAD) is engaged in several protocols that employ positron tomography (PET) to investigate the binding potential of various types of brain receptors in patients suffering from mood and anxiety disorders.  These studies hold great potential for informing clinical neuroscience about the pathophysiology of these conditions which performs the essential services of applying Tracer Kinetic Modeling (TKM) to transform the primary PET image data that NIMH acquire in research studies into quantitative measures of neuroreceptor binding potential. These services are under several NIMH protocols and another source could cause significant delays. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is except from FAR 6 based upon FAR Part 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement in writing within (10) ten calendar days from the posted date of this notice.

ORD has offices and laboratories throughout the continental United States and the requirement for support is nation-wide since  Microsoft applications are used ORD and only Microsoft Premier Support can provide access to Microsoft software developers and its proprietary source code for current and future products on a 24 x 7 basis.  Both the ORD Call Center and Enterprise Operations Center require such resources to support  the ORD user base of 3,500 users, 5000 workstations and 200 servers.  Any vendor that is a Microsoft authorized reseller could only obtain ORD's specialized support from Microsoft since only Microsoft is able to provide the access to its knowledge base and provide its developers to go to an ORD  site to diagnose problems for some of ORD's specialized programs, interview users and determine the best software coding that is required to solve ORD's time-critical needs.  Contracting for the ORD support using another vendor would result in unacceptable delays meeting ORD's user community and  Call Center requirements, and would also not be cost effective.  This non-competitive action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.301-1 - Only One Responsible Source.  This announcement constitutes the RFP and is the only solicitation that the Contracting Officer will issue.  Written  responses must be submitted via e-mail to pinskey.lin@epa.gov no-later-than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 27, 2007.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

We require horses of specified size and weight, and health and disposition.  Pre screening for infectious diseases such as Equine Infectious Anemia (Coggins Test) is paramount.  Appropriate size is critical due to the limitations imposed by the size of our holding stalls.  A supplier close to the ADRU facility is very important from the standpoint of health.  RFQs are not available for this requirement.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit proposals to the attention of Vickie Lutes,  USDA-ARS, 211 Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA  99164-6221.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to cancel the synopsis.  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) operates and maintains a complex ground system to support its environmental satellite system. The system includes two Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops Station, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska; a National Satellite Operations Center (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland; a product producing and distribution facility at Suitland/Camp Springs, Maryland; the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and the National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder Colorado.

Because of changes in spacecraft instrumentation, a succession of new spacecraft series and the never ending process of aging ground equipment, NESDIS is in a perpetual state of renewing, upgrading, and, in general, improving its data acquisition and satellite control system. These factors require, in addition to the constant effort to upgrade the system performance, a very intensive periodic effort of equipment refurbishment and replacement with the inherent problems associated with installation and integration. Consequently, contractor support is required to ensure timely implementation of the upgrading of ground equipment.

<DESC>As part of the continuing market research for the MiDAESS acquisition, industry is requested to respond to the following questions:

1. For those companies who believe that we should use a NAICS of 541712 for our technical/engineering support instead of 541330: 
Please tell us why you think that (other than "because that is what we have done before").

2.  For those companies who told us to avoid the mistakes of some recent support service procurements: Please tell us what those mistakes were.

3.  For those companies who said that we should put "teeth" into our small business contracting goals: Tell us what sorts of things would constitute "teeth".

4.  For those companies who intend to be part of a multi-company competing team: Please tell us the impact if we prohibited guaranteed work share for any team member.

5.  For all companies who intend to participate:  All companies winning a MIDAESS contract will get some minimum amount of work starting with contract award.  After award, where there are multiple awards, we want to adjust future work (up or down) based in large part on past performance. The adjustment process could, over time, result in one of the "winners" having little or no work. Tell us your opinion of this and provide a rationale.

Please send responses in MS Word 2003 format to MiDAESS@mda.mil.

The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer at  least 15 calendar days advance notice of the scheduled date for the PCA so that the Government may attend.   C.3.2.6.3 The contractor shall submit results of the audit demonstrating  compliance of each component, subassembly and assembly to all applicable drawing and specification requirements. Inspection results should validate 100%  of all drawing dimensions and characteristics with actual variable data provided as per (DI-CMAN-81022C). b.	Section I, Page 70, Change FAR 52.246-17 Warranty of Supplies of A  Noncomplex Nature, paragraph 5d.  This clause is being modified to remove  paragraph 5d and renumber 5e to 5d and 5f to 5e.  Additional the word Tailored  is hereby removed from the title. c.	Responses to questions received as result of the solicitation and  previous amendments are listed as an attachment below.  Parties interested in  receiving a copy of the previous questions referenced in the attachment below  should refer to amendment 0006 2.  The closing date remains unchanged as 19 November 2007, 3:00 PM EST.  3.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. Attachment Questions and Responses to additional vendor questions: Ref. Answer #16: According to the last response it is understood that performance testing is  demonstrate 99% reliability with 90% confidence.  With 90% confidence and 99% reliability, some small number of test units will fail over long term  production.  The accept/reject criteria in the TDP does not allow for any  failures.  Is it the intent of the government to accept performance results  which support 99% reliability with 90% confidence using a standardized  (industry recognized) statistical approach?  What approach will be used? Under stable production conditions, the M212 has demonstrated performance  reliability in excess of 99% reliability.  Lot Acceptance Test (LAT)  requirements are as prescribed in the specifications and contract.  The  contractor may propose to the Government alternate acceptance criteria for evaluation by the Government.  It would be expected that such a proposed  alternate acceptance test plans would provide the Government an equal or better  level of risk mitigation. Ref. Answer #17 & 57: Responses to these questions indicated that M212 flares and packaging  components shall be free of visible oxidation/rust.  Drawing 12988836, Fwd  Closure, material callout is a Brass  hard, IAW ASTM B16.  Brass is an alloy containing copper.  Copper oxidizes (tarnishes) naturally on exposure to air  and will always become visible oxidized absent some protective coating.  As  written, it is physically impossible to comply with the specification. Strapping material in the M212 Packaging Specification is galvanized, and the  PA19 Ammo Can is painted carbon steel.  Any irritation to the coatings on these materials may provide an opportunity for visible oxidation/rust to occur. Is it possible to distinguish between acceptable cosmetic surface discoloration  and actual oxidization damage to the surface as evidenced by a raised or pitted surfaces? Regarding oxidation: a.	Regarding the Fwd closure, is in accordance with ASTM B16 (referencing  ASTM B249 para. 7.3.3 or B250 para. 7.3.3) Superficial films of discoloration,  or lubricants, or tarnish inhibitors are permissible unless otherwise  specified. b.	Regarding the PA19 ammo cans, MIL-STD-406 provides visual acceptance  standards for Ammo Cans.  No rust is permitted on the inside of the ammo can,  exterior rust shall not exceed  square inch. c.	Regarding the strapping ASTM D3953 requires The finished coat of the  strapping shall be adherent, free of scratches, runs, embedded foreign matter, uncoated areas, rust areas, or loose oxide scale. (para. 10.2).  Note that  this is also true for the strapping seals (para. 10.3) d.	Differentiation for cosmetic is as specified above. Ref. Answer #18: Full ignition of the M212 flare has not been a past requirement.  When referencing wind stream data from the current contract, it is readily apparent  the time required to reach full ignition is consistently beyond the 12 foot ignition distance requirement (when related back to the functional testing).   It does not appear that the current configuration can comply with this requirement as written.  Is it the intent of the Government to update the TDP to allow compliance? Historic performance of the M212 Aircraft Countermeasure Flare has met and  exceeded ignition distance requirements.  Full ignition is defined as the  condition where the flare grain is FULLY engulfed in flame.  There shall be  visible flames covering the flare grain once the precut aluminum/filament tape  bursts open. The Government desires random sampling; all samples shall be pulled randomly.   MIL-STD-1916 samples shall be pulled randomly as well as LAT samples (M116- velocity/ignition, M117-IR output, etc.). Ref. Answer #23: The answer to question 23 appears to drive pre-selection of parts destined for  velocity and IR LAT testing.  The provided response says that for a lot size of  20,000 flares, 467 samples (192_150+125) must go through the x-ray because of note a on Paragraph 4.4.2.12.  However, applying this definition of the note  to the 12 other characteristics identified with the IV(a) verification level  will require pre-selection of velocity and IR LAT parts prior to final assembly  of the flares.  Pre-selection of parts destined for velocity and IR LAT testing  implies that the LAT test sampling is no longer random.  Characteristics in  addition to 115; such as 10, 107, 110, 113 and especially 108, do not require  100% verification and would therefore require a specific sample verification of those flares destined for velocity and IR testing.  Is it the intent of the  government to maintain random sampling of the LAT units? In order to maintain the randomness of LAT units we recommend that only the characteristics that require 100% verification retain the (a) note. The Government does not believe that this precludes random sampling.  Samples  can still be randomly selected and tested.  For example, from  previous answer #23 the 467 total samples can be randomly sampled throughout the lot and go through the non-destructive inspections (leak, x-ray, missing components,  marking, etc.); then the subsample for velocity/ignition (150) and IR (125) testing can be performed from them with the remainder (192) returned to the lot.  This does not decrease the randomness of the sampling. Ref. Answer #20: The provided response states 1 hour max ink dry requirement and subsequent  test has been decoupled from the ignition testing and test samples can no longer be used for both.  Please clarify if this is contradictory to Para.   4.4.2.12 Characteristic 111, note (a). The Government does not believe that this is contradictory.  As with #5 above, the samples can be randomly sampled and subjected to the marking test.  The 1916 portion of the sample can then be returned to the lot and the  ignition/velocity and IR output test portions can be subsequently tested. When is PCA to occur and for what quantities? Reference the changes to C.3.2.6 of the Statement of Work incorporated under amendment 0007. Will the likely quantity requirements discussed during industry day include  Supplemental Budget numbers? No, the budgeted quantities indicated during Industry Day does not account for  Supplemental Budget requirements. In the SYSTEMIC FAILURE LIABILITY clause, the final sentence states, If the  systemic failure is determined to be the result of a design deficiency,  redesign must be considered.  Please clarify, does this mean redesign of the process must be considered or does this indicate redesign of the product, or both?   FAR 52.246-17 - Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature (Tailored) identified in Section I of the subject solicitation is being modified to remove  paragraph 5d Systemic Failure and renumber 5e to 5d and 5f to 5e.  Additional the word Tailored is hereby removed from the title. L.11.4.2.2 states The offeror is to include all supporting information  Does  this mean we are required to include all the DD250s? No, you do not need to submit all the DD250s.  The Government can verify on time deliveries through information submitted in accordance with L.11.4.2.   Are we required to submit any deviations? In accordance with L.11.4.2.1 the offeror shall disclose information about  previous Requests for Waivers (RFWs), Request for Deviations (RFDs) etc.  While  you are not require to submit the actual RFW or RFD, you must provide the required information as stated in L.11.4.2.1. Would you be able to provide the make and model of the radiometers? This is provided for informational purposes only. Offerors are under no  obligation to purchase items from this vendor or use the same set up.   The detectors the Government use are liquid nitrogen cooled InSb detectors made  by Judson Technology (http://www.judsontechnologies.com/indiumAnt.htm).  The part number is J10D-M204-R02M-20.  The key change the Government made to the  detector is that we asked the vendor to make the dewar bottom thicker and add  two 1/4-20 screw threads so we could bolt the detector to a mounting plate.  The detector dewar normally do not have this configuration.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 2 of this synopsis is to provide guidance to foreign vendors interested in responding to this RFI.  This RFI is revised as follows: Pursuant to FAR 15.2, the Infrared and Optical Technology Branch, Missile Guidance Directorat e of the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), hereby issues this Request for Information regarding the technical feasibility of applying commercially available laser rangefinder components to a missile-bor ne sensor role. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Rather, this RFI is part of a technology survey that is an integral part of US Army planning efforts for possible future programs. Inform al or white paper responses using standard font size 10 or 12, with one inch margins in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format containing a description of appropriate technologies and how these technologies can be applied to this project are encouraged . The device specifications outlined below are derived from a set of notional system requirements, and can be viewed as performance goals. An effort is underway to determine the feasibility of utilizing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) laser rangefinder dev ices/components to construct a Height of Burst Sensor (HOBS) applique or kit for the existing Army missile inventory.  The sensor will be used to detonate the missile warhead at a To Be Determined (TBD) distance above the ground during the terminal phase o f a steep-dive maneuver. The HOBS will be capable of meeting the following performance objectives: Field of view - less than 1.0 deg; Height of detonation point will be fixed at minimum of 1meter to a maximum 30 meters; Detonation point precision plus or m inus 0.5 meters; Maximum closing velocity - 300meters per sec; Missile dive angle - assume 90 deg (vertical); Maximum physical size - 4cm by 5cm by 8cm, optical aperture/s on smallest surface. All Request for Information (RFI) questions, comments, response s must reference the RFI number and are to be submitted no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 31 October 2007 to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, AMSAM-AC-RD-RB, Building 5400, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898 Attn: Lisa D. Duncan or via emai l to lisa.d.duncan@us.army.mil. All information must be submitted in writing. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. Acknowledgement of receipt will only be issued if a return receipt is requested with the submission. Please do not submit any classified information. All information submitted will be treated as confidential and will not be released outside of the Government. The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance the Governments understanding of the respondents submittal.    As this RFI merely is to seeks information from industry to evaluate the technical feasibility of applying commercially available laser rangefinder components to a missile-borne sensor role,  qualified foreign contractors are permitted to submit white pape rs. However, while this RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal, foreign contractors should consider, and are hereby advised that submission of a white paper to this RFI does not eliminate any legal requirement relating to n ational security interests of the United States regarding any future military program or effort that may be classified or require access to controlled unclassified data or information, including the need of any contractor to comply established security cri teria for some, if not all, of the following: 1) Authority to access classified, military sensitive, or controlled unclassified data; 2) The capability of any contractor, subcontractor, and the respective employees of each subcontractor or prime contractor to access U.S. classified data; 3) a secure facility to perform the inherent duties requi red under any proposed effort relating to contract award as demonstrated by a duly approved DD 254; 4) The possession of a U.S. security clearance for any contractor, subcontractor or their respective employees; 5) A current COMSEC account; and 6) A current valid license duly approved by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C.  2778.  In order to avoid any false impression, prior to any foreign contractor submitting any whitepaper in response to this RFI, foreign contractors should consider that depending on the specific nature of any future procurement, while at this time the governmen t is soliciting a Request for Information only, foreign national employees may be prohibited from participating or working on a future Army effort depending upon the national security issues presented.

<CONTACT>Darby Watson Financial Analyst 5108171365     darby_watson@nps.gov;
<DESC>Question No.	Questions	Answers 1	What is the value of the current inventory and can it be acquired?	Per terms of the Prior Contract, the New Concessioner must acquire the inventory of the Prior Concessioner.  This value is estimated at approximately $6,439.  This is explained more thoroughly on Page 2 and Page 12 of the Business Opportunity.  2	Is the liquor license included?	The Prior Contract does not require the Prior Concessioner to sell his liquor license to the New Concessioner. The National Park Service estimated the costs to obtain a license and transfer fee on Page 13 of the Business Opportunity.   3	How many employees does Hugh currently have working for him?	One full time and one part time. 4	What are the operating expenses, salaries, wages, benefits, supply expenses, utilities expenses?	The prospectus provides publicly available information regarding the Prior Concessioner's operations.  These specific expense details are considered confidential business information not subject to public disclosure.   5	Is there facility rent?	There is no rent.  However, the New Concessioner must pay a franchise fee to the National Park Service.  See Section I of the prospectus, Business Opportunity, Franchise Fee, Page 13. 6	Annual property tax?	State and local jurisdiction in El Portal is discussed on Page 8 of the Business Opportunity.  It is the National Park Service's understanding that Mariposa County does assess a possessory interest tax on properties that are occupied but not owned by the occupant. Contact Mariposa County Assessor's office at 209-966-2332 for information 7	Are large companies allowed to bid?	Yes, any member of the public can submit an offer. 8	Will there be interviews of [offerors]?	Offerors are not interviewed. 9	Who sits on the panel?	Voting members of evaluation panels are federal employees but not those directly employed by the subject Park.  Other industry and technical advisors may assist panel members in evaluating proposals, but are not voting members.  A park representative will also be available as a technical advisor for any park specific issues, but is not a voting member.  . 10	Will Yosemite NPS concession staff provide any direction to the contract panel about community needs?	See response to question 9.  The National Park Service believes that the prospectus, as written, appropriately reflects the needs of the park visitors as well as the community.  11	Does the Park govern or control the concessioner's business operations (wages and operating costs)?	The Park does not control the Concessioner's wages and operating costs.  However, the Concessioner must comply with the New Contract, including its provisions regarding oversight by the National Park Service. 12	How do the concessioner and the Park interact?	These interactions are detailed in the New Contract, including Exhibit A (Operating Plan) and Exhibit E (Maintenance Plan).   13	Is there an accessibility plan?	Part of the work that the NPS will be doing to the Concession Facilities include making the front entry to the building more accessible for all customers. 14	Does the Park or the concessioner provide a safety plan?	See Section V, Risk Management Program, of the Draft Operating Plan. 15	When does the contract start?	NPS estimates that the effective date of the contract will be before the end of the first quarter of 2008.  See Business Opportunity, Pg. 11 discussing NPS completion of deferred maintenance.. 16	Are gift items allowed for sale?	No.  See Summary of Business Opportunity, page 1, Required Services, of the contract prospectus. 17	Will the interior walls be painted? By whom?	Before the New Contract begins, the National Park Service will paint exterior and interior walls, as described in the Business Opportunity, Pg. 11.  Thereafter, all painting will be completed by the Concessioner.  See Page 3 of Exhibit E-1 to the New Contract.,   18 	Would the paving be done in the summer?	All paving activities will be done in such a way as to maintain access to the building.  NPS does not have a defined schedule date for paving at this time. 19	Are there asbestos issues?	There may be asbestos in the restroom floor tile, but no NPS remediation is planned since it is not friable. 20	Will the new operation have a preferred offer in the future?	The 1998 Concessions Act gives a limited right of preference in renewal to some Concessioners in certain circumstances.  These circumstances are set out in 36 CFR 51.E, which is included in the Appendices to the Prospectus.  As these circumstances are dependent in large part on annual gross receipts as they will exist in the first twelve months of the next contract, it is difficult to estimate what those conditions will be six years from now. 21	This is a historic building: what about the compressor on the outside of the building?	The compressor is included in the Personal Property that must be purchased from the Prior Concessioner.  It would be the New Concessioner's responsibity to maintain all Personal Property including the compressor. 22	Since the NPS is not making the repairs [before the commencement of the New Contract], would the operator be allowed to be there, too, when the contractor is working?	Whether or not the repairs are completed directly by NPS or a Contractor , NPS expects the facility will need to be closed for a brief period during interior repairs.  At that time, only entry by authorized personnel will be permitted consistent with applicable health and safety requirements. 23	The list said that there would be no selling of gift items in the store (toys, mugs, t-shirts) for guests.  I am wondering if you are trying to eliminate that service.	NPS intends to retain the old time general store atmosphere that has existed for many years     Historically, gift sales have been nominal.  Also, the building assignment has limited square footage and NPS does not believe there would be sufficient space for sale of such items.  See Operating Plan, Pg. 19 for specific items required for sale  24	Are you capping the toy section?	See response to question 23. 25	Once you have the floor done, we will pretty much have an open building that we can do what we want with?	The Business Opportunity, section of the Prospectus states that this concession contract will provide for year round operation and management of an old time general store offering a variety of grocery and retail items, which are specifically listed.  The ambience and close community flavor of the store is expected to remain essentially unchanged under the new concession contract, without resemblance to characteristics of a convenience store. 26	How will we be monitored (by the NPS)?	See response to question 12.  27	Regarding the coolers, I noticed that one was looking like an antique and the other was newer.  Could they be consolidated?  It would save considerably on the power bill.	Yes, equipment (personal property) can be moved, changed, and replaced.   28	When would be decision (about a new operator) be made?	A decision will be made by NPS following the receipt and evaluation of proposals which are due at the NPS regional office in Oakland, California, on December 18, 2007.  29	What about prices?	The merchandise pricing method will be used for grocery and convenience items.  This method is described in the NPS Approval Guide, Appendix B to the Prospectus. 30	The warehouse (NPS) buys from Pioneer Market; could that be done through the El Portal Market?	NPS is required to follows Federal Acquisition Regulations when procuring services or products for the benefit of the National Park Service.   31	By 2012, we are going to see $100/barrel oil.  How will the park work with the concessioners to operate?	To the extent economic forces affect business operations holistically, the NPS merchandising rate mark ups should accommodate those changes.  NPS concessions law (36 CFR, Part 51) stipulates that the concessioner has a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the contract.   NPS does not guarantee a profitable concession operation. 32	Are there safety and environmental audits?	Yes, as discussed in the See Exhibit A ,to the Draft Contract, Operating Plan, and in the New Contract. 33	What about Mariposa County possessory interest taxes?  How much are they?	See response to question 6.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH TO IDENITFY TYPES OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRAINING CENTER (NETC) ADMISSIONS ACTIVITIES AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The NETC Admissions activities are similar to most academic environments and are centered on the receipt and processing of application forms; the assignment of applicants to classes; the processing of lodging requests; the  management of travel arrangements; and extensive back-end reporting and analysis.  The primary needs of NETC Admissions are to automate any and all possible data ingestion activities and then automate the tasks performed on that ingested data to provide Admissions services to the student and data visibility to the Federal user community.  Many of the tasks internal to the NETC Admissions business have been partially automated by an existing system.  However, that existing system does not provide sufficient architectural flexibility to allow for quick feature modifications; intuitive user configuration; effective data exchange with other systems; or use of current technologies to support Internet use.  PRIMARY ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE NETC ADMISSIONS SYSTEM INCLUDE:  (1) The NETC Admissions System will exploit the most current version of Oracle available to FEMA.  All data shall be managed within a secured and maintained relational database system.  The database shall be designed to ensure referential integrity and allow for concurrent use by multiple users.  (2) Hardware and software used to deliver on the requirements will meet the standards of the current Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture, as well as, FEMA product approval. (3) NETC employs a business model that utilizes an overall Operations and Maintenance team for all systems within the NETC IT infrastructure.  The skills required to support the NETC Admissions System will be fully documented to support staffing decisions.  (4)  It is expected that system content and the associated support requirements contain no esoteric attributes that would inject significant cost into the NETC business.  (5) All Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will be published and made available to FEMA, as approved by the system owner.  (6) Any algorithms created specifically to facilitate NETC Admissions business processes will be documented and published for FEMA such that they can be supported by Operations and Maintenance staff.  (7) Interfaces (human and machine) will be based on industry best practice and standards found in higher education models.  (8)  Solution design will support industry best practice in object-oriented technology and graphical presentation.  (9) Correspondence is critical to the conduct of NETC Admissions business.  It is assumed that hot-link capabilities will be provided for all outgoing electronic correspondence to allow recipients to easily navigate from said correspondence to related points of interaction with the NETC Admissions System.  (10) The NETC Admissions System will support the principles of leveraging existing software applications within FEMA and use of common tools across FEMA and DHS to promote information sharing, decrease cost and mitigate risks associated with Operations and Maintenance.  (11) Configuration capabilities must be present to adapt the system to changes in NETC Admissions business rules and processes. (12) Attributes and functionality contained in the NETC Admissions System will be intuitive to the users and supported through robust help functions such that timelines for learning, configuration and use are minimized.  (13) Secure interactions with the system must be provided through local interfaces and over the Internet.  (14) Environmental conditions will be similar to those outlined in DHS 4300A, Sensitive Systems Hand book.  (15) Web components must use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technologies.  (16) The NETC Admissions System houses sensitive privacy information.  All interactions with the system must be appropriately constrained (security and encryption) to prevent unwanted exposure.  Guidelines put forth by The Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, as amended will be met.  (17) Human interfaces will comply with the standards put forth in the 1998 Amendments to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C 794d).  (18) The NETC Admissions System must be supported through a complete documentation set that includes, but is not limited to: Business Rules; System Specifications; Software Specifications; Design Specifications; Database Specifications and Schema; Installation Specifications; Application Programming Interface Specifications; User Guides; System Administration Guides; Technical Support Manuals; and Training Manuals.  (19) Unified Modeling Language (UML) will be used to develop use cases that refine the business requirements and to define and capture the system design.  All other design and development aspects are constrained only by the generic standards deemed acceptable by FEMA and the artifacts prescribed by the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) governance.  RESPONSES SHALL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:  (1) Propose a solution/product, i.e., commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), existing system w/minor modifications, full development effort, etc. that will meet many or all of the NETC Admission System requirements.  Address each item above (#1 through #19) to describe how the proposed solution/product meets the primary assumptions for the Admissions System.   Provide a full description of the system, functions, diagrams, identify if it is proprietary, etc. (2) Identify and describe relevant experience using the proposed solution/product. This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but rather, is an exploratory request to determine the availability of COTS, GOTS, existing software system w/minor modifications or full development products and identify vendors who can provide a solution/product that will satisfy the requirements specified above.  The Government will review the information received to determine the acquisition strategy and assist with the development of the Statement of Objectives for this requirement.  The Government will not reimburse any concern for any information that is submitted in response to this RFI.  Responses should indicate whether they are large business or small business.

<CONTACT>John Dennard, Contracting Officer, john.dennard@navy.mil. 202-781-2846
<DESC>Program Manager Ships-Naval Special Warfare (PMS NSW) is seeking information and responses from interested sources to present technical, design, development, and/or manufacturing capabilities for recommended near-term (6-18 months) solutions for a ?free-flooding? Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) for Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This notice is issued as part of the preliminary market research effort.  PMS NSW intends to evaluate the responses received to establish technology solutions currently available with the highest potential for improving SWCS operational and logistical capabilities.  PMS NSW intends to use the information, with other information considered as well, to conduct further market research and product analysis.  It is anticipated that solicitation for products and/or services will be issued as a result of this market research for Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) equipment and designs for integration into the SWCS program.  PMS NSW reserves the right to hold additional market research meetings, including system demonstrations!   (if necessary), with some, but not necessarily all firms responding to this notice.  The preferred approach at this time is to leverage COTS equipment and systems to the maximum extent possible.  PMS NSW is also open to alternative solutions and minimal development items with value added potential. The SWCS will launch and recover from surface vessels and from submerged host platforms. The planned submerged launch and recovery platform is the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) mounted external to a nuclear submarine host platform aft of the sail.  The DDS space available is 8 feet diameter by 22 feet long from the sphere operator station to the apex of the elliptical outer door.  A proposed extension in length of the DDS from 22 usable feet of storage space up to 32 feet is possible.  No extension to the DDS is the most preferred option, minimizing the extension is the next preference, and an extension to the full 32 feet is least preferred.  The SWCS will have to be loaded, manned, and maintained while enclosed in the DDS.  The SWCS is intended to operate manned with a crew of two and a dedicated cargo area exceeding 180 cubic feet (approx. twice the available cargo volume of the MK8 MOD1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle) for transport of SOF personnel and equipment to mission areas.  The c!  rew will navigate the vehicle submerged while wearing Underwater Breathing Apparatus? (UBA) for primary life support, additionally, the SWCS will have a vehicle mounted closed/semi-closed breathing system to provide extended duration.  The vehicle will be equipped with; precision navigation, internal and external communications, obstacle avoidance and docking sonar systems, multi-axis integrated auto-pilot, life support, and modular sensor systems.  The SWCS will provide increased personnel and cargo capacities, range, speed, and endurance over existing MK8 MOD1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle while maintaining the ability to operate clandestinely in shallow restrictive waters. Improvement areas pertaining to near-term SWCS design efforts include but are not limited to the following areas: hull form and design, active and passive vehicle enhancements for diver thermal protection (hot and cold), secure VHF/UHF/SATCOM and hydro-acoustic communication, human systems integration and training, control and display systems, sonar systems, three dimensional obstacle avoidance and navigation display for improved situational awareness, open architecture designs, common non-proprietary systems, reliability, alternative material construction, submerged navigation improvement systems, design integration, system integration analysis, high capacity alternative power sources and/or storage, alternative underwater propulsion methods, payload and mission package development, automated system failure identification and diagnostic, automatic piloting and ballasting, and alternative methods and platforms for vehicle launch and recovery.  Logistic areas of interest incl!  ude: process improvement strategies, obsolescence management, document management systems that allow for improved information sharing with applicable safeguards, user-friendly features, efficient methods of configuration control, efficient parts tracking methods and identification, commonality of parts and repair tools, simplified technical and repair manuals, simplified customer feedback process, training methodology changes, training requirements identification. Responses to this RFI should discuss: a.	Capabilities, benefits, concepts for new systems, upgrades to known fielded systems, integration concerns, developmental issues and most recent demonstrations, potential mission or capability relevance, system reliability (Mean Time Between Failure), supply and support requirements, anticipated future support, implementation timeline, potential annual production capability,  and line item breakdown of ownership cost estimates.   b.	List any customers that procured your product(s).  List results and parameters of any field tests and compatibility with other systems and software.  Briefly discuss your vision and plans for insertion of technology enhancements for the product offered.  Include why PMS NSW should be interested in your product  and discuss your firm?s direct and relevant experience in design, development and/or manufacturing.   c.	Identify your firm?s strategy for integration of COTS equipment and systems.  For your products currently operational (both public and private) provide references and customer points of contact.  In addition, provide whether your product is offered on the General Services Administration?s Federal Supply Schedule.  Identify which contract line items make up your system with corresponding price data.  If applicable, state whether your product will operate with known commercial software systems (1) without modification, (2) with minor modification or (3) not as currently offered.  If available provide copies of any evaluations of your product conducted by outside, independent organizations.  The point of contact for this Request for Information (RFI) is Mr. Dennis Lynch at 202-406-1317.  Information and responses shall be submitted in English and no more than 20 pages in PDF or standard commercial format to: dennis.lynch.ctr@navy.mil.  Lodgment of interest shall be accepted up to 45 days from this announcement by electronic mail to dennis.lynch.ctr@navy.mil, for classified submissions please coordinate with Mr. Lynch (Classified material must be handled and marked in accordance with appropriate security regulations).  All interested sources are encouraged to respond. All responses submitted under the terms and conditions cited herein will be reviewed.  All submissions shall be considered proprietary/potential source selection sensitive and treated accordingly.   This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, a promise to issue a request for proposals, nor a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopsis requesting further information. All firms responding to this synopsis are advised that their response to this synopsis is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced later through the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and FedBizOpps and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this synopsis. Response to this synopsis is NOT a request to be added to a plan holder?s list or to receive a copy of a solicitation.

<DESC>Comments are to be forwarded to John E. Thomas only via electronic or facsimile transmission at the numbers listed below.  Do NOT call the Primary point of contact listed on this notice.  This notice is issued by the NASA/GRC to post a draft Statement of Work via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties.	Prospective offerors are invited to submit written or verbal comments or questions to: John E. Thomas, email: John.e.thomas@nasa.gov, phone:(216)433-2658  Fax: (216) 433-6382, no later than December 7, 2007.  See the attachments which contain the draft SOW and Specifications. The anticipated type of procurement action is to obtain commercially available units that are configured to meet NASA's specific function.  Some units will also need to undergo spaceflight qualification (i.e.environmental)  testing prior to delivery. Flight units will also need to undergo acceptance testing (3 line items: commercial unit, commercial units spaceflight qualified, commercial units acceptance tested prior to flight).  A 4th line item for 3 workstations and a 5th line item for technical support are also anticipated.  An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is anticipated with minimum and maximum number of data acquisition units over a 5 year period will be specified.  The contractor is expected to be able to either perform itself or subcontract out the environmental and space flight qualification testing. The following information is requested: Please identify if there is anything unclear in the SOW/Specification documents. Will having TBD's (specs portions to be finalized after award) pose a problem with proposing a firm fixed price for performance? Will having technical support priced by the hour pose a problem? (the actual amount of technical support is unknown and is anticiapated to be procured by the hour with a not to exceed number of hours specified in the actual procurement.) Do you normally provide some number of technical support hours inlcuded in the price with the items? It is assumed that a slightly modified commercial item will be procured, however, if the specifications attached indicate that a commercial item procurement is not possible, please inform us. Do any requirements in the CEI Spec or SOW pose a significant price increase from your commercially available hardware? Does any of the testing in the CxP 70036 (ENVIRONMENTAL QUALIFICATION AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS (CEQATR) need to be better defined? Are there any verification methods that may be changed to reduce cost, schedule while still maintaining assurance of required performance? Please provide rough-order-of-magnitude of MTBF data for individual boxes (acknowledging that this will depend on configuration)?

<DESC>Description

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking information and interest for a company to provide non-alcoholic beverage and/or limited food service in an experimental retail arrangement within a newly designed, customer-friendly full-service postal retail outlet.  The Postal Service wishes to create an environment that provides customers, including many small businesses, convenient access to a variety of business-related retail services co-located within the postal retail outlet.

This postal retail facility provides a contemporary USPS environment featuring; a staffed sales area with attractive merchandising and open service counters, self-service checkouts, AV furnished conference room and lounge area.  The interior retail space uses non-traditional colors, finishes, signage and casework and has a much more contemporary feel compared to traditional Post Offices.  The Postal Service provides shared-use areas and internet access over a dedicated wi-fi internet connection within certain parts of the building as well as 24-hour Post Office box and self-service area. 

The Postal Service has dedicated space within this newly renovated retail outlet for sublease to multiple vendors who will provide complementary services to postal retail customers, many of which are small businesses, home-based businesses, or business travelers.  The postal outlet is a leased facility located in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg near the metro area's largest shopping mall.

Purpose

USPS is interested in exploring an environment that provides our customers convenient access to a variety of business and related retail services co-located within a postal retail facility.  The future design of new, or the conversion of older, Postal retail offices may be an outcome of tests conducted at this facility. 

Opportunity

The USPS is seeking a better understanding of the interest and capabilities of recognized national, regional, or locally owned beverage and/or food service providers to complement this experimental small business focused retail outlet.
   
The ideal type of provider usually is categorized within the industry classifications below:

US SIC Code:
5812 - Eating Places
		
US NAICS Codes:  	
722211 - Limited Service Restaurants; 
722213 - Snack and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Bars
722330 - Mobile Food Services


Location and Hours

Chicago, IL Metro Area
United States Postal Service 
Woodfield Station

Hours of Postal Operation (open to the public)
Monday - Friday:  9:00 AM - 7:00 PM except for Federal Holidays
Saturday:  9:00 AM - 3:00 PM

It is anticipated that beverage/food service hours will match hours of operation. 	

Duration

The lease at this Postal retail facility will be for a period of one year.  The USPS seeks potential providers who can participate in the first year of the test and consider the possibility of extending their participation for a longer term. Extensions, if any, will be negotiated at a later date.

United States Postal Service Provisions

The USPS will provide non-exclusive use of retail space to a non-alcoholic beverage and/or food service provider whose main business fits into the above referenced areas of concentration. A negotiated lease arrangement for the first year with the USPS will be required prior to build-out activities.  The term is for one year with a possible second year after which both parties may, at their choosing, negotiate a new lease arrangement for a specified term and cost.  The USPS will provide facility access for additional hours than those noted above (consensus of USPS and vendor) to allow for stocking/service of vendor space. 

The USPS will provide approximately 330 square feet of dedicated retail space at the facility for non-alcoholic beverage and/or food services.  This space adjoins the Postal retail lobby.  The USPS may entertain discussion on sharing the cost of building out the beverage/food service space.

  
The USPS will provide access to common sanitary restroom facilities, ambient lighting, power, and telecommunication services for the vendor?s on site employees; however the vendor will reimburse the USPS for costs incurred in accommodating any specialized setup at the vendor location.  The USPS contemplates offering free third party wireless fidelity internet connection service (Wi-Fi Certified) for use by consumers during the test term. The USPS will also provide for building maintenance, utilities and centralized trash removal. 

The USPS will allow a company to utilize branding, logos, intellectual property icons or color schematics at the location with USPS approval providing that items are contained inside the leased space.  At this time, the USPS does not contemplate having external retail signage that conflicts with the look and feel of the Postal Service retail location, however, it remains open to suggestions and information on how external signage could be complimentary to our present look and feel.

The USPS does not seek any share of revenues for services provided or products sold during the lease term.


Items USPS Will Not Support

The USPS will not provide site security on behalf of an interested organization. However, the USPS does maintain its own security.

The USPS will not supply furniture; casework, fixtures or operational equipment for beverage/food vendor nor will it fund equipment installation.

The USPS will not provide Postal staff to operate beverage/food service.  

The USPS will not supply daily maintenance and housekeeping for vendor areas.

The USPS will not supply an internet service provider for vendor.

Liability insurance of any type for vendor employees, equipment or company-owned fixtures will not be provided by the US Postal Service and are the sole responsibility of the interested beverage/food service provider.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/RFI for the production of a solid state modulator system to replace the current high voltage modulator in the AN/TPS-75 Radar transmitter.  This is amending the RFI dated 01 Nov 2008.  The purpose of the amendment is to resolve the discrepany in the closing date.  The closing date is 30 Nov 2008 and to include the technical questionaire.

1.	Purpose. 
  
The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential providers of an AN/TPS-75 solid state modulator.  Also, the RFI included within this synopsis allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments for the interface development of their solid state modulator into the AN/TPS-75.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time; this announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis. Copies of the submitted information will be reproduced and submitted to the AN/TPS-75 sustainment office for review and will be used to develop the acquisition strategy and possibly an eventual Request For Proposal (RFP).

2.	Background.  


a.	The AN/TPS-75 is a tactical radar that provides long-range radar coverage in remote, areas of operation worldwide.  

b.	The transmitter modulator is a high failure system and contains two single points of failure.  Current plans call for replacing the current tube-driven modulator with a solid state system.  This will replace the Trigger Amplifier, the Shunt Regulator, the Pulse Forming Network, the SF6 Tank, the Focus Coil Power Supply and the Diode Stack.

c.	The new modulator must have the following operating characteristics:

1)	Draw the same or less power than the current modulator:  120/203 3-phase 400 Hz input voltage with current between 70 and 85 amperes dependent on Pulse Repetition Frequency

2)	Have the same or better efficiency than the current modulator.

3)	Have a projected Mean Time Between Critical Failures of 5000 hours or greater.

4)	Not require significant modifications to the existing TPS-75 shelter mounting system.

5)	Not exceed the weight bearing capability of the existing TPS-75 shelter.

6)	Provide power for the existing focus coil power supply.  This power supply must provide constant current to the focus coil as the resistance of the coil changes from as little as 20 Ohms to a maximum of 33 Ohms.

7)	Be compatible with the existing liquid and air cooling systems.

8)	Fit within the existing transmitter compartment, roughly 7 feet wide by 6.5 feet high by 3.5 feet deep.

9)	Provide required control and monitoring signals.

10)	Operate at a Pulse Recurring Frequency (PRF) of 235, 250 and 275 Fixed and 250 and 275 Staggered.

d.	Produce a modulator pulse with the following characteristics:
 
1)	Pulse width of 8 microseconds (at the 95 percent point).

2)	Rise/Fall times of 1 microsecond approximately

3)	 Voltage of 117,000 Volts.

4)	Compatible with a Twystron vacuum tube.

e.	In conjunction with installation of a new modulator, the Air Force anticipates the need for a new management and monitoring system.  This system shall be mounted on the transmitter compartment door, shall be automated and shall provide diagnostic, failure and control functions.  Specific functions include, but are not limited to monitoring, control, and display and storage of key signals.


3. 	Program Overview.  

The purpose of this sources sought is to determine possible manufacturers and suppliers to provide a fit and function replacement of the existing modulator with the previously defined performance characteristics.

4.  Information for Interested Parties.  

a.	Draft RFP.  There is currently no scheduled timeline for proceeding with this effort and thus no anticipated Draft RFP availability date.

b.  	Bidder?s Library.  If this procurement is pursued, it is anticipated that an electronic Bidder?s Library will be established for this acquisition.  Please check the web site in paragraph 5 below for information and updates regarding the Bidder?s Library.  

c.	Industry Day.  No industry day is currently planned for this procurement.  

5.  Market Survey / RFI Questions.  Please send your response to Brenda Collard at OO-ALC/LHKC 6021 Gum Lane, Bldg 1228 Hill AFB UT 84056-5838 or via e-mail at Brenda.collard@hill.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>70 -- SSA Seeking Sources Capable of Providing an Enterprise Solution for Database Security Compliance
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-SSS-ENTDATA-CS
<RESPDATE>120307
<ARCHDATE>12182007
<CONTACT>Cynthia Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov - Cynthia Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND: The President?s Management Agenda (PMA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) require Federal Agencies to develop and implement policies and procedures to secure agency information systems. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking a vendor who can provide a comprehensive, integrated enterprise solution for database security and compliance, assist SSA in improving the security posture of the SSA database environment, and provide compliance with relevant FISMA, NIST and OMB M-6-16 requirements.  SSA will use the database security solution to ensure that 1) systems are securely configured and that accurate and timely knowledge of configuration changes and new vulnerabilities within the database are reported and corrected; and, 2) systems are continually monitored for the purpose of identifying and responding to unauthorized or potentially dangerous activity.  MANDATORY EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: SSA is requesting that vendors respond to all general and technical requirements.  All responses will be used as evaluation criteria in determining the most suitable solution for SSA?s environment.  Any additional response will be evaluated as ?additional consideration? and weighted appropriately. Solutions that require more than one vendor to perform all tasks should have an integration document included. The integration document will be evaluated as a level of effort in comparison to a single vendor, fully integrated solutions. For example, if a database scanning solution is being integrated with a network monitoring solution, an integration document would detail the steps required to have the individual components operate successfully as a single solution.

The Contractor will be responsible for collecting, abstracting, and cleaning data collected from the medical providers for all medical provider types.  The Contractor will also be responsible for statistical matching of data from the MEPS-MPC to the MEPS-Household Component (HC) and producing matched data files, including documentation and codebooks.  In addition for prescribed medicines, the Contractor will be responsible for statistical and analytical editing and imputation of the data.  It is anticipated that the contract will be performance based for a Base period of performance of three and one-half years with three option periods. Each Option period, if exercised, will be for 42 (forty-two) months.  

The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home health care agencies, pharmacies, long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS sample persons.  MPC data serve as an imputation source for item nonresponse to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures.  It also serves as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients and prescribed medicines.  Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 


Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-MPC which collects data from all hospitals, emergency rooms, home health care agencies, outpatient departments, long term health care facilities and pharmacies reported by MEPS Household Component (HC) respondents as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital. Office-based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well.  Long term health care facilities include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, rehabilitation facilities, as well as any health care facility providing medical care to those reporting such care in the HC of the MEPS are also included.

Capable offerors must demonstrate they possess comprehensive expertise in data collection, abstraction and coding of medical and billing data from various types of health care providers, as well as extensive statistical expertise and extensive experience in data file development and documentation.  Capable offerors responding to this Sources Sought must demonstrate they possess the following capabilities and processes to perform the following tasks:  a) implement and document a sample; b) un-duplication within a sample; c) identification of hospital physicians; d) maintenance of survey questionnaires and materials; e) recruit, manage and train data collection staff, abstraction staff, and coding staff; f) data collection from hospitals, hospital identified physicians, office based sample (includes HMOs), agency home health care providers, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities; g) data processing; h) development of security plan; i) forms control and receipt; j) data entry; k) coding and cleaning of data; l) matching data; m) editing and imputation of prescribed medicines data; n) preparation and delivery of internal MPC Files including archival versions of the full operational database and the following medical event files: hospital stays (includes hospital identified physician and their payments and can be identified as such), emergency room visits, outpatient department visits, medical provider visits (includes HMOs), home health care visits, long term care stays (includes assisted living facilities, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, etc.), and prescribed medicines.  Offeror must also provide an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of data collection methods and processing, as well as data cleaning, data abstraction and matching tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data matching and data editing and imputation (for prescribed drugs only) techniques proposed; quality control; and a plan for addressing innovation and technological advancements and capability to maintain compatibility with industry mechanisms.    

The  MEPS-MPC  is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection from medical care providers of charge and payment,  condition, and medical procedures and services data, and; abstraction of medical and billing records; coding of health care data; statistical matching of records; statistical and analytical editing and imputation of prescribed medicines data; health care facilities billing systems and operations; training; and constructing large databases.  A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS-MPC core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the MEPS-MPC is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.    

Interested small businesses should e-mail their capability statements to Mary Haines, Contracting Officer at Mary.Haines@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 12 noon eastern time on December 3, 2007.  Organizations must tailor their capability statement to this request and must include their small business designation (i.e. HUBZone, 8(a), Woman Owned, etc.) on the cover page.

<DESC>Contact: U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD).  For submission of white papers email responses to Jason.Dabin@us.army.mil. Description:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis.  Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is interested in receiving information about existing time difference of arrival (TDOA) geolocation technologies that can be leveraged as a hardware/software platform for hosting an algorithm developed under a US Army R&D program for TDOA Geolocation in Multipath Environments.  I2WD is seeking detailed technical information on current TDOA ground-based geolocation systems, and how these s ystems can be leveraged for hosting a coherent TDOA based geolocation algorithm.  The system must consist of highly coherent sensors, for hosting an algorithm sensitive to timing errors and phase errors.  It is pertinent that the geolocation system have th e required hardware and processing power for hosting such algorithms, and also the ability to transfer data between nodes or to a single node, while preserving the timing and phase coherency of the signals received at the nodes.  Proposals shall describe w hat technology can be leveraged from the current system, and what needs to be developed further if necessary for the prototype system design to host coherent TDOA geolocation algorithms. Background:  The overall objective is to develop a geolocation system utilizing coherent processing between widely dispersed sensors.  Exploiting phase measurements between sensors has the potential to dramatically improve source location resolution by an order of magnitude compared to non-coherent, conventional TDOA measurements.  It is imperative that the prototype design solution maintain time and phase synchronization amongst sensors for optimum coherent TDOA geolocation performance.  The goal is to dem onstrate a successful coherent TDOA geolocation system that integrates the algorithms developed under a separate US Army R&D program into a proposed prototype design solution.  It is expected that the prototype system design will begin during FY08 and be c ompleted by the end of FY09 or sooner that demonstrates the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 criteria.  TRL 6 is defined as sensor systems, signal processing algorithms, and data fusion algorithms that have been successfully field tested in a realistic e nvironment on functional prototype hardware. In addition to the technological details provided in the description and background, I2WD seeks responses about the following major system components of the proposed prototype system:  1. Software defined RF receiver solutions capable of receiving a variet y of signals of interest.  2. Digital signal processing solutions capable of performing the complex tasks of geolocation in real-time or near real-time. 3. Synchronization techniques to enable the phase and time synchronization between distributed sensors.  4.  Technologies/methodologies for relaying geolocation information to the user. 5. Wireless networking and data link technologies to enable rapid exchange of information between sensors, and between sensors and a central processor. 6. Antennas for interc epting signals of interest. Submission Information:  Responses shall be emailed to the address listed in the contact information, and not exceed 30 pages in 12 pt, Times New Roman font.  Supplemental materials, such as brochures, briefings, spec sheets, etc., are welcome as long as t hey accompany a response.  When preparing your responses, be specific, and make sure you answer the following questions:  What technology, by name, fits this background and how does it address the major technical components.  Describe the technology in det ail, and how it meets the objectives of the project description.  What is the status of the technology?  Is it available now?  If not, when will it be availabl e?  How extensively has it been tested?  If the system does not currently meet all technical requirements such as phase and time coherency between sensors, are potential system hardware upgrades available?  This RFI does not constitute a commitment on the part of Government to purchase systems or services.  US Army CERDEC does not intend to pay for the preparation of any information submitted nor guarantee any awards will be made.  All proprietary information shall be marked accordingly.  All responses are due by December 17, 2007.

<SUBJECT>58 -- FSC 5895
<DESC>Federal Biz Opps Notice
	?National Exigency? for FSC Code 5895

This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) regarding FPI?s production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5895 - Miscellaneous Communication Equipment.

A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product?s expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that ?increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.?

On May 7, 2007 , FPI received an official request from the Department of the Army?s Program Executive Office - Command, Control, and Communications Tactical at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.  The correspondence requested FPI to fulfill DoD?s need for Installation Kits in FSC code 5895.  FPI?s FY 2007 sales ceiling for FSC code 5895 is $45.3 million and the request would result in sales exceeding that amount.

The DoD request states that ? To date, UNICOR is the only known, qualified manufacturer of the FSC 5895 Installation Kits.? 

FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines? ?national exigency? provision.  In light of the military?s critical need for this item, FPI staff requested its Board to invoke the ?national exigency? provision for FSC code 5895.  On August 8, 2007  FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request.  Accordingly, FPI?s sales in FSC code 5895 may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.

It should be noted that the national exigency provision of FPI?s guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military operations.  While the requested production levels are deemed to be on a temporary basis, at this time, DoD does not know how long the requirement for additional production in this FSC code will last.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD?s expanded needs will continue as long as the Army is involved in overseas conflicts.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI?s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC 20534. Attention: FPI Board of Directors.

<SUBJECT>39 -- FSC 3920
<DESC>FedBizOpps Notice 
FPI Production of Materials Handling Equipment, 
Non Self-Propelled
FSC code 3920



In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to seek and pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily(CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18.U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce metal containers for federal agencies on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status. Once a product is sold competitively, by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI?s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>TECHNICAL POC: Terry Halkyard, FHWA, (202)493-3467; Terry.Halkyard@dot.gov  KEY DATES:  In order to be considered for funding, all proposers MUST submit pre-proposals by not later than 4PM EST, Dec 17, 2007. The FHWA anticipates that evaluations will proceed generally as follows: (1) BAA Opens Nov 16, 2007; (2) Pre-Proposals Due Dec 17, 2007; (3) Full Proposal Invitations Feb 25, 2008; (4) Full Proposals Due Apr 10, 2008; (5) Initial Contract Awards Sept 2008.  OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION: The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is soliciting proposals under its Exploratory Advanced Research Program (EARP) for research and development (R&D) projects that could lead to transformational changes and truly revolutionary advances in highway engineering and intermodal surface transportation in the US. The objective of this BAA is to stimulate R&D in high risk, high payoff projects that address technology and knowledge gaps. FHWA is especially interested in building upon, adapting or otherwise leveraging and utilizing the R&D investments made by other Federal exploratory advanced research programs such as those of the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation.  PROGRAM SCOPE: The program scope is intentionally ambitious and broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations will strategically support.  Advanced research in a wide spectrum of science and technology areas is intended.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology and knowledge gaps described below.  Strategically, this research will help the FHWA improve highway safety, reduce congestion on the nation?s highways, reduce environmental and health impacts of the nation?s highways and reduce the long term costs and improve the efficiency of the nation?s highways. This program is intended to spur innovation and focus on high risk and high pay-off R&D projects.  Incremental advances and demonstrations or evaluations of existing technologies are not within the scope of this program. The following focus areas are of particular strategic interest and relevance to the FHWA and proposals in all of these areas are highly encouraged. This guidance is offered to help Offerors in the development of proposals of particular interest to FHWA:  Highway Safety; Dramatic Breakthroughs in Planning and Environment; Innovative Solutions to Understanding and Applying Transportation Policy; Innovative Solutions to Reduce Traffic Congestion; Innovative Infrastructure Solutions; Cross-cutting Exploratory Advanced Research.  The following sections provide amplification of each focus area. These are not intended to be all inclusive, and all creative and innovative ideas and solutions will be considered. HIGHWAY SAFETY: The human and economic loss due to highway crashes in the US remains at unacceptable levels. Over 43,000 people die on America's roadway every year and almost 3 million are injured. The US Department of Transportation (DOT), States, localities and the private sector are all working to dramatically improve safety and reduce the numbers of fatalities and injuries by 20 percent by the end of 2008. The ability to reach this goal has been constrained by a number of factors. Renewed research, technology, and innovations are key components to finding solutions to the problems.  Current R&D programs at FWHA and other US DOT agencies are directed at short-term safety improvement initiatives, as well as longer-term research, especially into Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) solutions. Major research into the understanding of crashes, especially from the integrated perspective of the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure is underway as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) II at the National Academy of Sciences/Transportation Research Board. Exploratory advanced safety research proposals that would supplement and complement these existing research programs are sought.  Proposals dealing with the following areas, each more fully defined below, are especially welcomed: (1) Enhanced understanding of the importance of the visibility of the roadway.  This could include improved understanding of various levels of roadway lighting, minimum levels of sign and pavement markings visibility to the driver, excessive signage, distractive features, etc. Visibility issues both at night or daytime are encouraged. (2) In concert with the States, vehicle manufactures and other in the private sector, create the parameters for a long-term ground traffic control system that would individually monitor all drivers and vehicles, their roadways, and environmental conditions; assess the likelihood of a crash or vehicle conflict on a real-time basis; utilize a communications system to warn of potential conflicts; and eventually have the capacity to take control of vehicles in unsafe circumstances that could not be prevented, but for such assumption of vehicle control. (3) Enhanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between the vehicle (all types) and the roadway and roadside. These relationships include the friction between the vehicle and roadway and roadside surfaces, the mechanisms associated with inducing rollover, side contacts with barriers, and side slope effects. The relationships developed in these efforts will serve to improve the analysis of crashes (including crash simulations) and the development of advanced vehicle control systems and safer highway features.  PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENT: If we assume that the trends of the past 80+ years are reasonable predictors of the future then traffic, both passenger and freight, will continue increasing and highways will need to accommodate this increasing traffic. In this case, more will have to be known about how to plan these highways; how to avoid, minimize and mitigate the environmental consequences of constructing these highways; and how to deal with the property acquisition and management issues associated with these highways. Good planning relies upon good data. This includes data on traffic volume, speed, time of day and time of year variations, spatial distribution of population, employment and commercial activities and similar items. These data items are used to calibrate traffic models and forecast future traffic. Many of metropolitan areas use traffic models as a basis for producing long-range, i.e., 20+ years, transportation plans.  These traffic models require the data on current volumes, speed, etc. Obtaining this data is expensive, so much so that some areas use what is, in effect, simulated data. Other related data, e.g., accident data and pavement condition data are used. These data are used to develop medium range metropolitan programs for highway and transit projects expected to be implemented in, typically, 5 years. The pavement related data acquisition for this activity is sometimes a mixture of the reports of various agencies (e.g., states, cities, counties, villages, park districts) depending on which agency has maintenance responsibility for the road. Environmental analysis and assessment relies upon measurement and monitoring of levels of various species of chemical compounds (or in some cases elements) in the water, in the soil and in the air in the vicinity of current and planned highways. Monitoring is done both preceding environmental documentation of a highway action and as part of ongoing system analysis. One important use of such data is to calibrate existing predictive methodologies. As with traffic, each of the species would have a concentration that varied by time of day and time of year. Existing monitoring typically is done by state and federal resource agencies (e.g. US EPA, state air quality agencies). The quality of the data thus obtained may be suboptimum or for many species (e.g., complex toxins), entirely absent. The needs identified above are based upon the assumption that existing trends will continue. It can also be reasonably assumed that the trend of increasing traffic with time (passenger, freight or both) might be reversed. There have been several short-term reversals of this trend in the past (less travel during gas rationing during World War II and during the two gasoline shortages in the 1970s). Proposals addressing the following needs are highly encouraged: (1) Improve the data collected, systemize the data for easier use, and reduce the cost of the data collection for both the 20+ year planning activity and the 5 year programming. (2) Improve both the environmental data collected and reduce the cost of environmental data collection. (3) Develop an early prediction system that would indicate the potential for a reversal in the trend of increasing traffic based on technological change. TRANSPORTATION POLICY: The focus of exploratory advanced research in the area of Transportation Policy is to understand the complex socio-economic interdependencies of surface transportation systems and the policies that create, maintain and operate these systems.  This research is also intended to develop the ability to model, analyze and plan surface transportation solutions over different spatial and time scales. These innovations are expected to originate either from new ideas or else from adaptations of ideas from other fields or disciplines. The innovations expected to result from this advanced research program, if successful, should provide policy makers with forecasting tools that can be used to predict possible transportation outcomes based on financial decisions, condition and performance of the existing transportation system and future transportation trends. Proposals are encouraged that explore the interdependent relationships between surface transportation systems, innovative financial mechanisms used to fund major infrastructure projects, advanced modeling systems and tools that could be used to analyze and predict future impacts of various transportation scenarios. 
Proposals addressing the following specific topics are also highly encouraged: (1) Analytical Approaches to Multimodal Investment Analysis; (2) Emerging Issues in Innovative Finance; (3) Alternative Futures to Freight Mobility; (4) Integration of Transportation Data from Multiple Sources; (5) Travel Demand Response to Travel Pricing; (6) Geospatial Data Acquisition for Highway System Performance Monitoring; and (7) Advanced Approaches for Identifying Fuel Tax Evasion Practices.  TRAFFIC CONGESTION: In May 2006, former Transportation Secretary Mineta announced a major initiative to reduce congestion on the nation?s transportation network. The Texas Transportation Institute has estimated that in 2003, traffic congestion nationwide cost the economy over $65 billion per year (reference: http://tti.tamu.edu/documents/mobility_report_2005.pdf), a figure that has more than doubled since 1993. This figure would be even higher if it accounted for the significant cost of unreliability to drivers and businesses, the environmental impacts of idle-related auto emissions, or increased gasoline prices. Major sources of congestion on the highway network include bottlenecks, incidents, adverse weather, poor signal timing and work zones. Congestion caused by these sources is difficult to mitigate due to the lack of mechanisms to control traffic demands and prevent gridlock where capacity limitations exist. This inability to control demand is exacerbated by the fundamental economic fact that individual motorists' price for transportation service does not reflect the full cost of congestion from their use of the highway facilities. The focus of exploratory advanced research in the area of Traffic Congestion is to identify, develop and assess innovations that have the potential to dramatically reduce traffic congestion through significant operational and technological improvements. These innovations are expected to originate either from new ideas or from adaptations of ideas from other fields or disciplines. These innovations, if successful, should provide considerable relief to drivers and significantly reduce the costs of congestion. Proposals that focus on congestion mitigation that explore longer-term, higher risk ideas with the potential for dramatic breakthroughs addressing the causes and consequences of traffic congestion are specifically encouraged. Proposals addressing the following specific topics are also highly encouraged: (1) Research that addresses the gaps in understanding and knowledge of Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) and that develop new mobility concepts, validate driver behavior and acceptance, and assess the feasibility and mobility benefits through simulation studies based upon VII.; (2) Research to investigate the adaptation of state-of-the-practice of heuristic methods used to solve complex optimization problems in other domains, such as such as military science, computer science, and enterprise integration with the objective of applying these heuristic methods to the domain of ITS; (3) Innovative approaches to generate origin-destination (O-D) tables. Of particular interest is the possible identification and adaptation of algorithms and computational methods used in other domains in order to identify an estimation model that can provide highly accurate O-D table data in real-time; (4) Research to investigate if advanced materials can be developed and incorporated into pavements to support network radio communication services.  This communication innovation could reduce the costs of communication for traffic management and other public purposes. This technology could also enable new applications such as automated and pervasive system condition and performance monitoring that would not be possible otherwise; (5) Research in effective data fusion, data mining, and non-parametric approaches for assessing highway conditions and performance that will overcome the existing gaps in data quality. HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUS AREA:  The FHWA has a long history in developing advanced highway technology and supporting the practical application of technical innovations and advancements.  This is continued under the recently enacted Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which authorizes the Federal surface transportation programs through the end of Fiscal Year 2009. In the area of infrastructure R&D, the focus of FHWA?s efforts has been to deliver tools and knowledge that enables the US highway system to provide the public with a high level of service and long life at reasonable cost, while minimizing annual maintenance demands. In addition, it is hoped that the US highway infrastructure can enhance rather than degrade the environment, and can be readily adapted to changing demands. In order to achieve this vision, infrastructure R&D must address quality standards, specifications for materials and systems, construction practices, and effective system preservation approaches and tools. Much of the FHWA's R&D in the infrastructure arena is currently focused on delivering short-term products as identified by the Agency's partners and stakeholders. However, there is also a need for research that supports the development of the next generation of highway infrastructure, addressing such issues as quality performance data, improved materials and systems, improved fabrication and construction practices, and new decision-making tools and models. Proposals addressing the following needs are highly encouraged: (1) FHWA is interested in innovative or alternative materials that have the potential to reduce or eliminate shortcomings of existing materials; may enable broader use of innovative pavement and structural elements which have not found wide use for economic reasons, despite superior technical performance, and which may encourage the development of entirely new types of structures and pavements. (2) Improved performance of pavements and structures can occur in part through improved quality control of materials and construction. Several breakthrough technology innovations in real-time quality control have been incorporated over the years into automated concrete and hot mix asphalt plants.  There is both a need and the potential for more such real-time quality control innovations throughout all elements (mix transport, placement, lay down, consolidation, curing, etc.) of the construction process. Developing and implementing the innovations should result in savings gained from a better performing, more cost-effective constructed product and the use of fewer quality control and quality assurance personnel to measure and monitor quality. (3) The design and analysis of pavements and structures needs to be based on fundamental engineering to enable the optimized use of resources and contracting methods. Innovative technologies and advanced computing power should be applied to enhance the understanding of the relationships between materials and construction to performance and provide the ability to predict the expected performance of structures and pavements. (4) Develop innovative ideas, techniques and tools for the collection, integration, analysis and interpretation of infrastructure management system data for efficient management of infrastructure assets and effective communication with owners and stakeholders. CROSS-CUTTING EXPLORATORY ADVANCED RESEARCH: It is recognized that there might be research topics and ideas that while not specifically addressing the topics listed above, should be considered. There are also research topics that are more fundamental or enabling in character and as such cut across the focus areas identified above. In fact, although presented within a specific focus area, several of the ideas presented above do cut across focus areas. In keeping with the Congressional intent of the EARP, the FHWA is interested in any proposals for longer-term, high risk research that could bring about dramatic breakthroughs for improving the durability, efficiency, environmental impact, productivity and safety (including bicycle and pedestrian safety) aspects of highways and intermodal transportation systems. In submitting proposals, Offerors are reminded that the intent of this program is to fund applied research that, while high risk and perhaps long term, is undertaken with a specific problem or need in mind. Basic research is not within the scope of this program. GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION:  Offerors are required to obtain the Proposer Information Package (PIP) for this EARP BAA, available at:

STATEMENT OF WORK
for
REMOTE RADIO ACTIVATED SOUND SIGNAL (RRASS) 
13 Nov 2007

Background: The USCG C2CEN has historically utilized civilian personnel as well as contractors specialized in electrical equipment (Non-Information Technology, IT) manufacturing and assembly. The Government shall and has provided the contractor the majority of the components used to assemble the Remote Radio Activated Sound Signal (RRASS).


1.	SCOPE:

The U.S. Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) has developed a new Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) product referred to as the 1SG38-RRASS - REMOTE RADIO ACTIVATED SOUND SIGNAL UNIT.  This unit will control the operation of various Short Range Aids to Navigation (SRAN) navigational devices (e.g., Sound Signals, Rotating beacons, Lanterns, etc.) that are located in remote locations. The contractor will be tasked to mount components, assemble cables, interconnect wiring and label the units in accordance with the technical specifications provided in this document.

The 1SG38-RRASS unit consists of a BL2030(0VST9) Single Board Computer (SBC) housed within a NEMA Type 4.4X.12.13 environmental proof container along with a 1J5T2-DL-3400 VHF Transceiver/Modem, an eight (8) position Configuration Dip Switch (CDS), a 3-Pole Double Throw (3PDT) Type Selector Switch, a relay, and a IS-50NX-C2(61114) Lightning Arrestor.  The transceiver/modem unit consists of the 1J5T2-DL-3282 Modem and the 1J5T2-DL-4010 VHF Transceiver that operates at a frequency of 164.3 MHz.  The lightning arrestor is installed to protect the unit from a possible lightning strike to the FG1620 (0RM74) VHF unity gain antenna.  The setting of the CDS determines how the 1SG38-RRASS unit is configured.  The 1SG38-RRASS unit is designed to work with most SRAN equipments.  In most SRAN configurations one 1SG38-RRASS unit is configured as a Control Unit (CU) and is connected to a controlling device such as the CEVV-VM100 Fog Detector.  However, the controlling device may be something as simple as a toggle switch.  A second unit is then configured as a Receiving Unit (RU) and connected to a remote indicator such as a navigational light or sound signal (ex. FA-232).  The BL2030(0VST9) SBC within the CU monitors the operation of the controlling device, CEVV-VM100 Fog Detector, until there is a change in the condition being monitored.  The CU unit will then transmit this change to the RU to either turn on or turn off the remote device.  The BL2030(0VST9) SBC used in the 1SG38-RRASS is also capable of monitoring other conditions such as a failure timeout, manual test, or board failure and to initiate the required action between the two units.

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a revised Request for Quotations (RFQ) for leased office space that will house NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) employees. The Government?s baseline requirements are required submittals in the Offeror?s proposal in order for the proposal to be considered for further evaluation. The Government?s value characteristics, or trade-offs, are not required characteristics in the Offeror?s proposal; however, they are highly encouraged. The Government contemplates a firm fixed price contract. The lease will have a twenty four month period of performance with four 3-month options for a total thirty six month potential period of performance. BASELINE REQUIREMENTS: The Government has a minimum requirement of 13,000 and a maximum requirement of 15,000 square feet of commercial office space.   1.	Size:  The building shall have a minimum of 13,000 available square feet.  2.	Space configuration:  The building shall provide a combination of open space and single offices. 3.	Single offices:  The building shall provide at least fifteen single offices. 4.	Conference rooms:  The building shall provide two conference rooms, one of which seats at least 50 people, and two small breakout rooms suitable for seating at least ten people.   5.	Access:  The building shall be open to NASA employees for nominal access from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm seven days a week, with limited, controlled access capability twenty-four hours a day.  6.	Parking:  Parking spaces shall accommodate approximately 100 people. 7.	Building classification:  The office space shall be identified, at a minimum, as CLASS B office space.  CLASS B space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as a more speculative investment, and as such, command lower rents or sales prices compared to CLASS A properties.  Such buildings offer utilitarian space without special attractions, and have ordinary design, if new or fairly new; good to excellent design if an older non-landmark building.  These buildings typically have average to good maintenance, management and tenants.  They are less appealing to tenants than Class A properties, and may be deficient in a number of respects including floor plans, condition and facilities.  They lack prestige and must depend chiefly on a lower price to attract tenants and investors.    VALUE CHARACTERISTICS: 1.	Size: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that offer a minimum of 13,000 and a maximum of 15,000 available square feet on one floor. 2.	Space configuration:  Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that offer the maximum contiguous space, up to 15,000 square feet. 3.	Single offices: Consideration will be given to the number of single offices in excess of fifteen offices. 4.	Conference rooms: Consideration will be given to the number and seating limit of conference rooms in excess of the baseline requirement. 5.	Parking spaces: Consideration will be given to the number of parking spaces in excess of 100 spaces. 6.	Building classification: Consideration will be given to CLASS A office space.  CLASS A space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as extremely desirable investment-grade properties and command the highest rents or sale prices compared to other buildings in the same market.	Such buildings are well located and provide efficient tenant layouts as well as high quality, and in some buildings, one-of-a-kind unique floor plans.  These buildings contain modern mechanical systems, and have above-average maintenance and management as well as the best quality materials and workmanship in their trim and interior fittings.  They are generally the most attractive and eagerly sought by investors willing to pay a premium for quality.  7.	Occupancy date:  Consideration will be given to properties available for occupancy by January 7, 2008. 8.	IT Cost Considerations:   a.	Line of Sight: Consideration will be given to proposals that have an unobstructed clear line of sight from the roof of the facility to the roof of Building 45 (the second tallest building on the JSC campus) with a maximum range of 3 miles.  This will allow for wireless communications. b.	 North Side of NASA Parkway: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that are located on the north side of NASA Parkway. This will allow compatibility with other Government communications systems.  c.	Proximity:  Consideration will be given to proposed property?s proximity to NASA JSC. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Once leased, the property may undergo minor modifications such as moved walls, doors, electrical outlets, and installation of security systems to accommodate the needs of NASA JSC.  Any prohibitions or restrictions against such modifications shall be expressly stated in the proposal. The Government intends to view the proposed property after receipt of proposals.  Dates and times will be determined with the Offerors after receipt of proposals. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION: 1.	Proposals shall address, at a minimum, all baseline requirements. 2.	Proposal shall address the following pricing information: a.	Proposal price shall include a firm fixed price for the basic twenty four month lease with separate firm fixed pricing for each of the four 3-month option periods. b.	The firm fixed price for the basic twenty four month lease and each of the four 3-month option periods shall include all additional elements such as, but not limited to, overhead, management fees, janitorial fees and utilities.   c.	A per hour price for building operations after hours (such as air conditioning use). 3.	In addition, Offerors shall submit: a.	 A floor plan clearly identifying the proposed available space. b.	 An indication of normal business operating days and hours. 4.	Proposals must be submitted to the contracting activity identified below by 3 PM CST 12/3/07: 		NASA JSC 		Attn: Maria Alberty/BJ3 		2101 NASA Parkway 		Houston, TX 77058 EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to price and other factors considered in the RFQ.  The following trade-offs, or value characteristics, shall be used to evaluate offers: Size of the office space  Space configuration of the office space Number of single offices Number of conference rooms Number of available parking spaces Classification type of the building Occupancy date IT cost considerations It is critical that Offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.  All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax) to Maria.J.Alberty@nasa.gov or 281.483.9741 no later than 12 PM CST 11/21/07.

The statement of work follows: 5 October 2007 TITLE:  Senior Technical Editor - U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental 	   Medicine (USARIEM), Thermal & Mountain Medicine Division 1.0  Background:  The U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) published a textbook in 1988 to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary (1961-1986) of the Institute. This book was edited by Kent B. Pandolf, Michael N. Sawka and Rich ard R. Gonzalez, and was written by authors associated (past and present) with USARIEM. This book published by the Cooper Publishing Group was 637 pages with 16 chapters, and sold between 1000-1500 copies with four (two hard-cover and two soft-cover) print ings. USARIEM plans to publish a Second Edition of this textbook entitled, Human Performance Physiology and Environmental Medicine at Terrestrial Extremes to help commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Institute which takes place  in 2011. This book will ha ve three Editors of which two are currently Division Chiefs (Drs. Michael N. Sawka and Andrew J. Young) at USARIEM. This new book will be about 750 pages with 19/20 chapters, and will approximate 24 lectures sufficient for a two-credit college/university c ourse. The core group of authors will be associated with USARIEM, but will be expanded to include other internationally recognized experts in environmental physiology/medicine. Each chapter will have three authors and a participating Editor. The agreed upo n Publisher will be Lippincott Williams & Wilkins while the agreed upon Partner/Sponsor will be the American College of Sports Medicine.    2.0  Requirements:  The task shall include shared oversight with the two other Editors of the textbook.  Production of this book will take about three years.  This book will be focused towards being both an upper level undergraduate and graduate student te xtbook, and a reference book for the military. (The required number of hours is 275 per year). The Contractor shall provide an employee who will serve as one of the three textbook Editors. After attaining both a Publisher and Partner/Sponsor, the three Editors must finalize the Table of Contents which includes the 19/20 chapter titles and agreement on the associated authors. Each chapter will have three authors (57-60 total) who must be invited and agree to help write the chapter. Approximately 50% of the authors will be from USARIEM while the remainder will be selected from experts worldwide. The th ree Editors will invite the authors, oversee the chapter writing, and share in the editing of these 19/20 chapters. The three Editors will be responsible for replacing authors as necessary. All of the figures, tab les and references must be formatted properly to a common format agreed upon by the Publisher and the three Editors. The Editors must design the textbook cover, and prepare the front matter. The three Editors shall share in the responsibility of editing th e chapters. The 750 pages of chapter page proofs must be reviewed by the three Editors several times prior to printing by the Publisher.   The production of this textbook is a very complicated task demanding proper timeline interactions with the Publisher, involves marketing plans with both the Publisher and Partner/Sponsor, and interaction with 57-60 chapter authors. This textbook could be u sed by many colleges/universities world-wide, and also be one of the best military reference books for dealing with war fighter performance at the environmental extremes of heat, cold and high altitude.   3.0  Estimated Performance Period:  The period of performance is one year from the date of contract award with four additional option years.  4.0  Guidelines for Personnel Qualifications:   Successful completion requires demonstrated capabilities to perform the requirements listed above in paragraph 2.0.  To support these tasks, the employee shall have previously served as the Senior Editor of s everal published textbooks involving similar research topics. 5.0  Facilities and Equipment:   The government will provide on-site administrative/technical support as needed to perform this task.  The Contractor will provide a nametag for the employee (to be worn at all times while on the government installation) tha t specifies the employees name and the name of the Contractor.   6.0  Security Requirements:   The Contractors employee for this tasking must be a U.S. citizen.  This is an ADP-III Non-Sensitive contracted-out Position.  The Contractor must initiate a National Agency Check. The Contractor must provide written proof to the USARIEM Information Management Officer (508-233-4842) that the NAC has been initiated.  Retention in the position is contingent upon completion of a favorable adjudicated security investigation if the employee is hired prior to the completion of the NA C.
