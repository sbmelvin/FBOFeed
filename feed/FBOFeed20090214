<DESC>Provide professional engineering services to complete facility investigations, working drawings, cost estimates, revise specifications and construction period services for the construction project entitled "Interior Maintenance Employee Locker Rooms" Project No. 575-10-104.  Scope of Project:  This project is to upgrade the employee locker rooms located on the first floor, south wing of the medical center.  These rooms have received minimal attention since the building was constructed in 1949; therefore most finishes in the area are original.  This translates to the expectation that piping in the area is insulated with asbestos containing materials, paint may contain lead and all must be abated.  The Architect/Engineer will produce full design and construction documents for a project to upgrade the locker rooms to current interior design, finishes, electrical and mechanical requirements.  Space for an addition to the building is available directly to the east of the two rooms for expansion.  The design is to include a set of male and female, handicap accessible public bathrooms off the corridor.  All designs are to meet seismic requirements for Moderately High Seismic Zone as designated by the USGS zone map.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Veteran Owned Small Business in accordance with Public Law 109-461 and 38 USC 8127 & 8128.  NAICS is 541330.  The small business size standard is $4.5 million.  Firms desiring consideration should submit two (2) copies of their Standard Form 330 no later than 4:00 p.m. (MDT) March 20, 2009.  Potential contractors must be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov) and Center for Veterans Enterprise Web Portal (www.vetbiz.gov) at the time of submission of their qualifications in order to be considered for award.  Standard Form 330 can be obtained at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType+SF .  Selection Criteria will be as listed on the following website:  http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard/aeinfo/sl_crit.doc .  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED.  This procurement is also being conducted contingent upon availability of funding.
