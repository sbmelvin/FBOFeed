<DESC>This solicitation was previously synopsized under Reference Number PR12380.  The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Farm Service Agency.  BACKGROUND.  The FARM SECURITY AND RURAL INVESTMENT ACT OF 2002, commonly called the 2002 Farm Bill, requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop a comprehensive information management system to be used in implementing the programs administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).  The Farm Bill also requires USDA to utilize the services of a non-Federal entity to assist in the development of such a system, and requires that a preference be given to entities that have prior experience with the information and management systems of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and that have collaborated with the Corporation in the development of the identification procedures required by section 515(f) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1515(f)).  OBJECTIVE.  The objective of this procurement is to enter into a contract with a non-Federal entity to assist the Secretary of Agriculture in the development of the information management system required by Section 10706 of the Farm Bill.

NOTE:  The solicitation number will be changed when the solicitation is issued.     A site visit/preproposal conference has been tentatively scheduled for the 9th and 10th of September 2003 at Fort Greely, Alaska.  More information will be provided regardi ng this visit/conference at a later date.  The requirement is as follows: Fort Greely, AK.  The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) project will have DSCS and MILSTAR support at FGA.  The DSCS facility will house the AN/GSC-52A (V) 4 terminal (SHF X-band) and will be remoted to room 145.  The MILSTAR AN/FRC-181(V)1 (EHF) termin al will be in room 144 of the Readiness and Control (R&C) facility.  The two terminals and their associated buildings will be hereafter referred to as the FGA Satellite Communications (SATCOM) facilities.  These systems shall be contractor-operated and mai ntained. There is a requirement for early implementation of the operation and maintenance of baseband equipment at the FGA Readiness and Control Facility.   Eareckson Air Station, AK.  The GMD project will have DSCS support at EAS.  The EAS DSCS will house two AN/GSC-52A(V)4 terminals (SHF X-band) and will be remoted to Room 511 of the Cobra Dane, Building 4010.  The AN/TSC-86D, transportable DSCS terminal, wi ll be installed to fulfill EAS operational requirements prior to the operation of the AN/GSC-52(V)4 terminals.  The AN/TSC-86D will be temporarily located adjacent to the AN/GSC-52A(V)4 terminal facility and will be removed after the AN/GSC-52A(V)4 termina ls are operational.  There will be approximately 13 weeks of overlap when the AN/TSC-86D will continue operation and one AN/GSC-52A(V)4 terminal will begin operation.  A Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) technical representative will complement the AN/TSC-86D ea rth terminal (ET) for operations and maintenance oversight during the total period of operation.  The terminals, including the remoting system/baseband and associated secure voice telephone equipment, all associated support systems and shelters, but not in cluding their associated exterior buildings, will be hereafter referred to as the EAS Satellite Communications (SATCOM) facilities.  These systems shall be contractor-operated and maintained. Major differences in EAS requirements from FGA requirements are: EAS will have two AN/GSC-52A(V)4 DSCS Terminals, EAS will one AN/TSC-86D, EAS does not have a MILSTAR requirement, EAS is on a remote island with limited services and limited travel supported  by scheduled Military flights from Elmendorf Air Force Base (AFB).

The contractor shall determine what components need to be replaced either due to DMS or capability deficiencies on the existing legacy stations, determine if the extent of components to be replaced warrants complete replacement of the legacy test stations, and determine the most cost effective approach to resolve the component problems using the DOD Automatic Test Station Selection Process Guide.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Furthermore, offerors and potential offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for costs, if any, associated with this NOPCA.

Depending on the number and quality of the responses to the RFP, the Government intends to award up to four (4) large businesses and up to two (2) small business contracts. The Government intends to award without discussion. This acquisition is anticipated to be solicited as a partial Small Business Set-Aside.  (NAICS 541710 (Aircraft Systems Development))  All contractors (including small business contractors) need to perform the full breadth of work. Six (6) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, task/delivery order type contracts are under contemplation, with task/delivery orders issued as either completion or term form, to be determined prior to task/delivery order award.  The Government intends to use multiple delivery order contract types under this effort including, but not limited to, cost-reimbursement, firm fixed-price, and time and materials.  The period of performance is composed of a six (6) year base period and three (3), 3-year options to extend the term of the contract.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the procurement for Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) services for the proposed adaptive reuse of Building 7 of the GSA Campus, Auburn, Washington, from existing warehouse space into office space.  DEFINITION OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AS CONSTRUCTOR: The General Services Administration (GSA) defines a CMc as a firm that contracts directly with a building owner, here, GSA, to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction management services. The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and various options for Construction Phase Services, which are described below. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. Stage 1 of the process will be a Request for Qualifications, under which the Government will evaluate experience and past performance and advise offerors of their competitive viability. The Government will evaluate Stage 1 submissions to establish a Voluntary Short List (those firms considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award). Firms on the Voluntary Short List will be invited by the Government to participate in Oral presentations, followed by stage 2 submissions. Stage 2 submissions will consist of a conceptual estimate and pricing for Pre-construction phase services, and any other requirements stated in detail in the RFP. For those within the competitive range, the Government may enter into discussions before soliciting Final Price Revisions. However the Government reserves the right to award the contract without discussions. Contract Award: A fixed price contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Preconstruction Phase services. The price for Construction Phase services will be negotiated at a later date and should result in a fixed price award fee contract.  Stage 2, Request for Proposals, which will solicit price proposals, and additional technical evaluation factors. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). PROJECT SUMMARY: The project scope includes conversion of approximately 120,000 gross square feet of warehouse space to office space. The project includes demolition, base building construction, tenant fit-out, and site work.  The building tenant will be the Social Security Administration (SSA) Teleservice Center. The estimated range for construction cost, including tenant fit out is $10,000,000 to $20,000,000. Occupancy is anticipated by January 2007. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED: The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in this presolicitation notice. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. The CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines. Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, primary cost estimates during design development and construction documents, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest. Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA. During contract performance, the CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for renovation and conversion of the facility.  SB - SDB Participation: Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities. Short-listed firms shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve participation goals.   PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, Advisory Multi-Step process (FAR 15.202). Under Stage I of the Request for Proposal (RFP), #GS-10P-03-LTC-0074, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past experience, past performance, personnel, and resources. Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the RFP. All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the Stage I RFP. After evaluation, all offerors will be notified in writing of their potentials as viable competitors and whether they will be invited to participate in Stage II of the selection process. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to the submissions, offerors may participate in the Stage II process. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on Stage II proposals without holding discussions. How to Offer: Detailed instructions for submission and format requirements are provided in Part 2- Proposal Submission Requirements of RFP# GS-10P-03-LTC-0074. The RFP is posted at www.eps.gov. RFPs may also be requested by contacting the Contracting Officer via email at ted.mahoney@gsa.gov. All Stage I submissions must be delivered complete, no later than 3:00 p m PST on 17 September 2003.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (NOTSD) requires Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) development, fabrication and testing of the Virginia Class submarine Emergency Diesel Generator Control Panel (DGCP) Front Panel Simulator (FPS) and logistics support for the Virginia Emergency Diesel and Generator (EDG) Set. The successfully tested and completed trainer shall be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT. The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, casualty and degraded modes, maintenance, engine troubleshooting and fault isolation skills. The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B). The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected. The student station configuration will include the DGCP, the diesel local control panel (DLCP), a laptop computer system and an engine generator mockup. The DGCP will have the same exterior appearance as the tactical DGCP with all exterior components operational and capable of providing the same operator/maintainer responses that the tactical DGCP provides. The DLCP will have the same exterior appearance of the tactical DLCP with all exterior components, except Black Start, operational and capable of providing the same operator/maintainer responses that the tactical DLCP provides. The DLCP will interface with the laptop computer.  The laptop computer will host Caterpillar's Electronic Technician (ET) Tool and will provide the same operator/maintainer responses that a unit connected to a tactical EDG would provide.  The 3512B has several control modules.  Only the modules containing displays are required to be physically represented.  Use of actual modules are not required but may be used. The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it. The tactical DGCP for the submarine is an Electric Boat product.  The Government will provide the DGCP technical manual and the preliminary ship system manuals.  There will be no additional government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system. This acquisition succeeds previous solicitation N61339-03-R-0029, announced 6 Feb 03 and released 6 March 03.  The requirements for this acquisition have been significantly reduced.  Those companies who submitted proposals in response to N61339-03-R-0029 will automatically receive the RFP.  All other prospective offerors are requested to contact the contract specialist by email.  Please provide full mailing addresses and phone numbers.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to secure a complete set of services that have historically been accomplished by numerous individual contracts.  Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, and services to construct modified fuel profile zones, treat and remove products, treat miscellaneous noxious weed/plants, treat riparian reserves and reduce fuels during the period of July 2003 to November 1, 2004 on the Weaverville Ranger District, Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Trinity County, California.  In the past, contracts have been awarded for logging, fuel reduction, wildlife enhancement and stream channel protection/enhancement in the same general area.  Each of these was designed to meet the management objectives for a narrow range of resources.  Fuel reduction was for fire management and silviculture goals; logging was for timber and fire management goals, wildlife enhancement for recruiting wildlife habitat and soils concerns: and stream channel protection/enhancement was for fishery, soils, and hydrology goals.  This contract combines all of these operations into one contract to take advantage of the efficiencies of having one larger operation to meet multiple objectives.  Approximately 630 acres in one bid item will be treated with a combination of the following treatments.  Work consists of product treatment and removal (logging by helicopter and ground-based equipment), hand cutting live, dead and damaged vegetation, riparian reserve hand piling/burning, grapple piling, lopping and scattering, mastication, hand piling whole units, and fireline construction.  Estimated start work date is July 2003 with a contract time of 2 years.  There will be a pre-bid tour; date and time will be announced in the solicitation.  Solicitation will be a Request for Proposal with the evaluation criteria clearly identified in Section M.  Solicitation documents will be available for downloading off this website on or about May 13, 2003.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with Kline & Co. Inc., 150 Clove Road, Little Falls, NJ 07424 to provide consulting services to a create database for identifying pesticides that were on the market in the years 1976 and 2000 for treatment of residential pest, and to assign a probability that each pesticide was used to treat a specific type of pest.  This information will supplement work conducted previously by Kline & Co., Inc., during the years 1980 and 1990.  Although such information is available in the literature for agricultural pesticides, an exhaustive literature search revealed virtually no quantitative historic information on pesticide use in residential settings.  The Federal agency responsible for regulating pesticides used in homes and gardens is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  EP routinely uses data from EPA market research firms when analyzing the economic impacts of regulations that EPA promulgates restricting pesticides.  Based on a review of this work, NCI has decided to calculate the probabilities and confidence levels for two additional years: 1976 and 2000.  Kline & Co., is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the necessary historic market research data on residential pesticides.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 2,2003.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement if being procured under FAR 13 Simplified acquisition procedures. No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 541611.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   This solicitation is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541710.  The size standard is 500 people. The solicitation will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 13 "Simplified Aquisition Procedures". Sediment materials have been collected from wetlands  constructed for treating waste water from municipal, agricultural and industrial effluents as well as reservoir sediments from a multi-use recreational/flood control reservoir.   These samples were immediately preserved with formaldehyde and stored in a cold room (4oC temp).  Specific locations  were sampled in the wetlands starting at the inflow area and proceeding to the outflow area of the wetland, and specific sites were sampled around the reservoir corresponding to potential anthropogenic inputs of stressors into the reservoir.  The research interest is to determine if there are  differing levels of benthic invertebrate communities in each of these wetlands and reservoir sites and if these communities change from the top of the wetland (site near the inflow) to the bottom of the wetland (site near the outflow) or depending on the type of stressor that the invertebrates may  be exposed to in the reservoir.  The results from this analysis will be used in support of research conducted by the USEPA to evaluate the long term effectiveness and viability of using constructed wetlands to mitigate stressors from various types of effluent as well as developing a decision  support system for large multi-use reservoir management and restoration. The government will provide samples to contractor for sample sorting, taxonomic identification and analysis.  The contractor shall conduct sample sorting, and taxonomic identifications of samples submitted. The government  will provide relational information to contractor so that data interpretation can be conducted.  The contractor shall interpret the results and make comparisons for the sample relationships provided by the government.  Requests for a copy of the solicitation should be submitted via e-mail to  hennessey.mike@epa.gov

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

“M.2 Evaluation Criteria: Technical and cost factors will be evaluated as described herein.
 (a) The criteria below are presented by major category, with relative order of importance, so that offerors will know which areas require emphasis in the preparation of proposals. The criteria below reflect the requirements of this particular solicitation. Offerors should note that these criteria: (1) serve as the standard against which all proposals will be evaluated, and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which offerors should address in their proposals.

(b) Technical Evaluation Criteria: The technical proposal will be scored by a technical evaluation committee using the criteria shown below. 

 (1) Personnel Qualification and Experience (35 Points) a. Technical experience and abilities of proposed team members relative to the scope of work. b. Balance between qualified expatriate and Bosnian senior program staff.  
(2) Past Performance (20 Points) a. Past performance evaluation will focus on such qualities as specific experience in media development work, demonstrated knowledge of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the region, quality of personnel and workmanship standards; b. Quality of prior professional relationships with media counterparts and members of the donor and international communities: c. Quality of home office managerial oversight and quality of home office/field office relationships: d. Demonstrated ability to indigenize programs. 
(3) Proposed Approach to Activity (45 Points) a. Extent to which the proposed approach is consistent with and supports the program aims outlined by the scope of work. b. Degree to which the program is indigenized. c. Quality of management plan, including grants management.

(c)  The Government intends to make an award to at least one responsible and responsive offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Technical, cost and other factors will be evaluated relative to each other, as described herein.  Although cost is not being specifically scored, the award selection will be made on a best value (technical or non-cost versus cost tradeoff) basis, where all non-cost factors will be significantly more important than cost.

 (d) The cost proposal will be analyzed as part of the proposal evaluation process. The cost proposal will be reviewed to determine if the overall costs proposed are realistic for the work to be performed.  Proposed costs may be adjusted, for the purposes of evaluation, based on the results of the cost analysis and its assessment of reasonableness, realism, completeness, and credibility. 

 (e) Prospective offerors are forewarned that a proposal with the lowest estimated cost may not be selected if award to a higher priced proposal affords the Government a greater overall benefit.  Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors set forth above.  Estimated cost and price shall receive significantly less consideration than overall technical ability; however, estimated cost is an important factor. 
  
(f) The estimated cost to the Government increases in importance as competing proposals approach equivalence in technical merit and may become the deciding factor where technical proposals are approximately equivalent in merit.”

13.  As stated in Section H.4, Page H-1, the currently authorized AID Geographic Code for the procurement of goods and services is 000 (U.S.) and 168 (Bosnia and Herzegovina). If required, USAID will consider authorizing additional geographic code areas in accordance with its associated waiver and approval process.

14. All references to a “performance based contract” are hereby deleted.  As stated in Sections B.2 and L.3, this is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract. Also delete any references to “the cooperative agreement contractor.”

15. As a point of clarification, all annexes to the solicitation can be found at the Federal Business Opportunities web page together with the original solicitation document, as amended.

16. As a point of clarification, FAR clause 52.219-9 (Small Business Subcontracting Plan) will be contained in the resulting contract. Offerors should familiarize themselves with the requirements of this provision.

All other solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps System Command (USMC), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS) Radar Systems Program Manager is seeking information on the ability to provide an interim solution for the Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) requirement via software and or hardware up-grade of the AN/TPQ-46A.  This up-grade will be used to support the USMC direct and indirect Target Acquisition and Friendly adjust fire missions on current and future Rocket, and Missile systems. The up-grade should allow the AN/TPQ-46A to detect, track, and acquire rocket class targets, in all terrain, weather, and electronic attack environments. The up-grade will increase the maximum range for rocket type targets to greater than 45km.  In addition, consideration will be given to an optimized cannon artillery mode that provides extended range capabilities for the specified targets of interest.  These enhancements may be accomplished by specific modes of operation that optimize the radar parameters and focus on the required expected target class.  Simultaneous modes are desired, but not required.  Existing minimum range, search sector, and simultaneous tracking of multiple target types is within trade allowance.  Maintaining existing AN/TPQ-46A CEP with respect to range, is desired and the existing mobility, transportability, false track rate, clutter cancellation/sub-clutter visibility requirements will apply. Track quality shall be sufficient to support counter fire missions of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS) and LW155 Cannon. The up-graded system shall maintain interface to current (AFATDS) for command and control.  Hardware up-grades will be backwards compatible with existing Firefinder software when not in the enhanced mode.  Current prime mover (HMMVW) is to remain the transportation configuration. The equipment enclosures shall protect equipment from damage by dust, wind, salt spray, rain, and ice. Because this capability provides an interim for the Ground Weapons Locating Radar GWLR, contractors are invited to read the draft (GWLR) ORD at Anteon Corporation (Suite 101, 1229 Garrisonville Rd, Stafford, Virginia 22556) by coordinating a visit request in advance with Ms. Lisa Herbst (540) 658-1335.  Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Lee Kerr, by 15 Sep 2003. Please submit all information to Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: CTQ2LK/Ms. Lee Kerr, 2200 Lester Ave. Quantico, VA 22134-6050. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<SUBJECT>D -- Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Cuba Request for Information
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce a Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMS LANT) request for information (RFI) related to the provision of commercial long distance telephone services, incoming and outgoing, between accessible worldwide locations and the Naval Station (NAVSTA) Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In addition, dial-up internet access, INMARSAT and occasional satellite uplink services will be required.  NCTAMS LANT is requesting industry input to identify potential solutions for meeting the Government’s requirements that will enhance the competitive environment for a subsequent solicitation as well as improve the morale and welfare of personnel assigned to NAVSTA GTMO by providing needed services at the lowest cost.  The Government anticipates placing an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type of contract that will incorporate fixed per minute charges.  The contractor will be required to provide unofficial users with services at the same rates established for official users.  The official service will be used to supplement government owned and operated services.  The unofficial service will include service to residential quarters, military bachelor quarters, a telephone toll center, telephone pay stations and private contractors.  In addition to the provision of long distance telephone service, the contractor will be required to provide administrative telephone service consisting of monthly billing and collection for local and commercial long distance services, operating a telephone business office and providing station message detail recording and detailed call billing to the NCTAMS LANT Base Communications Office.  The contractor will provide telephone operator support for station operations, to include long distance service, directory assistance, person to person calls, incoming and outgoing collect calls, and emergency assistance for domestic and international telephone service.  The contractor will also provide a telephone toll center for the provision of direct dial and operator assisted calls.  The contractor will be responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance of service from their equipment to the Government’s demarcation point.  The contractor will be responsible for all coordination with common carriers, local exchange companies and foreign postal telegraph and telephone agencies that are required to provide the service.  Currently, NAVSTA Guantanamo has approximately 4,600 lines of service.  The estimated usage for the past year is 12,649,422 minutes with 9,745,218 outbound minutes and 2,904,204 inbound minutes.  Specifically, the Government is seeking industry input to address the following items:

(1) The Government desires that assigned personnel be able to use all domestic and international industry calling plans and cards without incurring excessive charges.

(2) Although the resultant contract will not specifically establish rates for inbound calls to the NAVSTA Guantanamo Bay, the Government desires to ensure that the cost of inbound calls are as low as practicable.

(3) How to enable the direct dialing to special numbers such as 400, 500, 800, 866, 880 and 888 without incurring a separate charge.

(4) The provision of directory assistance and collect calls without incurring additional charges from the per minute charge established in the contract.

In addition to the foregoing, the Government invites comment on any other ways in which Industry envisions the Government can meet its requirements while enhancing the competitive environment and improving the morale and welfare of personnel assigned to the NAVSTA Guantanamo Bay.

This request is for information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government may arise as a result of the submission of industry information.  Industry is advised that information submitted in response to this RFI may be used in formulating the Government’s requirement.  Those interested in responding to this RFI should submit their responses to Guy Goss at Guy.Goss@navy.mil.  Questions concerning this RFI may be directed to the attention of Guy Goss at (215) 697-9662 or by e-mail to guy.goss@navy.mil.  Information should be submitted by no later than 10 September 2003.

<SUBJECT>--MPE 1.12 PLGR Cards
<DESC>NA Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to place a Firm Fixed Price, Purchase Order for a quantity of 15 MPE 1.12 PLGR Cards on a sole source basis with Rockwell Co llins, 400 Collins Rd N.E., Cedar Rapids, IA 52498.   The MPE 1.12 PLGR Card is an integral piece of the electronic avionics system of the Raven UAV (Unmanned Air Vehicle).  This GPS card provides global position and location data to guide the Raven, which  is essential to navigate the aircraft.  The MPE 1.12Ã¢Â€Â™s size and weight is critical to maintaining the low payload of the Raven UAV.  Lighter payload increases the flight duration, which in turn, allows for increased intelligence gathering and dissemi nation.  It also generates very little heat and draws very little power, which is critical, as the system is battery powered.  If less power is required by the Avionics suite to operate, the remaining power can be dedicated to powering the motor. This incr eases flight duration, which translates to longer missions.   Rockwell Collins is the only manufacturer and sole distributor of the MPE 1.12 PLGR card.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit p roposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete with t his proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  	Interested Parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at stephen.abate@natick.army.mil.

2.	PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished generally consists of the following principal items.  This does not mean that the work consists only of these items, but that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work, which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer.  This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor’s estimate at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer.

b.	Remove all trees existing in the four 50H:1V approach-departure clearance zones located at the north and south ends of runways 17L and 17R. Note that the 50H:1V horizontal surface area is an extension of the slope ratio area; refer to Figure 3.17, pg. 3-26 (UFC) Legend – items C and D. 
c.	Each of the four approach-departure clearance zones (horizontal areas) is approximately 206 acres. The areas where trees are to be removed are significantly less, approximately 20 acres total throughout the four different locations. 
d.	In the 50H:1V (horizontal) areas, all trees are to be removed regardless of the ratio; it is only used as a work area indicator.

======================STATEMENT OF WORK===================
STATEMENT OF WORK
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS              

1. BACKGROUND
 
 The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center (DFAS/CA) performs financial and accounting functions for several governmental agencies conducting various operations throughout the world.  The Center currently has a one-year contract, which expires on September 30, 2003.  The purpose of this solicitation is to open the bidding to interested parties in establishing a long-term contract for a process that allows the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center to continue paying foreign vendors/contractors in a variety of foreign currencies.
 
2. SCOPE

A. Concept of Operations:

1.  Disbursements -

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center will establish an account(s) with the contract bank.  When processing foreign currency payment(s) to foreign vendors/contractors, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center shall notify the contract bank of the impending payment(s).  Upon notification, the contract bank shall purchase the amount of foreign currency required for the payment(s) and provide the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center the exchange rate and U.S. Dollar equivalent.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center will process the payment(s) in U.S. Dollars for deposit into an established account for subsequent transfer by the contract bank to the payee in the specified foreign currency.  The contract bank should have the capability of transferring foreign currency via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Check/Draft.  The proposed system should eliminate the need for Limited Depository Accounts (LDA¡¦s), as outlined in the DoDFMR, Volume 5, Chapter 14.

2.  Erroneous Payments -

In the event an erroneous payment is made, it may be necessary for the contract bank to research the payment and provide copies of documents related to that payment.  If the payment must be voided and collected back into the account, the contract bank must refund the exact U.S. Dollar amount at the exchange rate quoted for the original disbursement resulting in no gain or loss due to exchange fluctuation.   

3.  Collections -

The contract bank should also have the capability of receiving and forwarding collections from debtors.  These would be payments made payable to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center in a foreign currency.  The contract bank would receive the foreign currency payments and convert such payments to a U.S. Dollar equivalent for deposit into an account.  The contract bank would then forward the U.S. Dollar amount to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Collection transactions being processed by the Contract Bank and forwarded to the Columbus Center.  

4.  Payment Date -

The payment date shall be defined as the date on which foreign currency draft or electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments are dated.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center shall establish the payment date in which the foreign currency payment must be made.  The contract bank shall be responsible to ensure the payment is made on the established payment date.  Coordination will be made between the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center and contract bank to ensure funds are on deposit in the account on the payment date.

The Contractor shall be able to lock in a rate for a minimum of ¡§current plus five business days¡¨ for all supported currencies to allow time for transactions to be entered in DoD systems (i.e., entitlement, disbursing, and accounting systems).  

B. Disbursing Transactions:
 
The average number of foreign currency transactions for the current Fiscal Year has been 135 transactions per month.  The dollar amount of each transaction may range between $50 to $3,000,000 per transaction.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Disbursement transactions being processed by the Columbus Center.  

C. Fiduciary Relationship:
 
 By definition and according to the terms of the contract, the contract bank shall act as an instrument for the Defense Finance and Accounting ¡V Columbus Center in processing foreign currency transactions.  
 
D. Records Retention:              
 
All records and data turned over to the Contractor as well as any new records and data created by the Contractor remain the property of the Government.  The Contractor shall only use information obtained from direct input by DFAS staff or other data requesters into the Contractor¡¦s stand alone system for the purpose for which the data was provided.  The Contractor shall be responsible for retaining the data, as a backup, for a minimum of 6 years and 3 month, as outlined in the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives, and Records Administration.
   
 This period will require the contract bank to continue the retention and availability of records beyond the expiration/termination of the contract. The contract bank shall retain transaction records that are consistent with the requirements of the Disbursing Office. 
 
E. System Architecture:  

Any foreign currency related software should be able to accommodate the following computer system architecture:

Pentium 3 (900 Megahertz) IBM Compatible Personal Computers
128 Megabyte of RAM  
20 Gigabyte Hard Drive.
3.5 Floppy and 32X CD ROM Drive.  
US Robotics 56K Modems.  (Note: Phone line is not dedicated to Modem use only).
Windows 2000  (Note: Future plans will change to Windows XP).
Office 97
Netscape version 4.75 for web version

The Personal Computers are not connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) for the stand-alone versions

F. Support/Maintenance:                
 
It shall be incumbent upon the contract bank to support the process both administratively and technically.  Such support should include material and training to explain the process with direct access to support personnel should questions or situations arise which require an immediate response. The Contractor¡¦s primary representative or alternate(s) shall be available during normal duty hours within 60 minutes, and within 2 hours after normal duty hours to discuss problem areas.

4.  EVALUATION

A. The primary evaluation factors are listed below in ascending order of importance, unless otherwise indicated.

1. Operational Approach

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to Paragraphs 2.A-D  as outlined in this Statement of Work.  The offeror shall also address his/her capability of meeting the transitional requirements specified under Paragraph 2.I.  This section is limited to eight (8) pages and should address any planned future enhancement to the proposed process. 

	2.  Technical Approach  

The offeror shall provide a list of all support and maintenance functions related to their proposed process as outlined under Paragraphs 2.E-F.  This section is limited to four (4) pages.  

	3.  Cost 

The offeror shall provide a detailed list of all costs associated with the implementation, maintenance and support of the process.  This section should clearly address costs related to items listed under Paragraph 2.G and is limited to three (3) pages.

4.  System Requirements 

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to items listed under Paragraph 2.J and is limited to three (3) pages.

	B.	Scoring Method.  The following method will be used in assessing each operational, technical and cost proposal as outlined in this Statement of Work:  

	Outstanding-4	Very significantly exceeds most or all of the requirements.  Response exceeds a "Better" rating.  The Offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.

	Better-3	Fully meets all of the requirements and significantly exceeds many of the requirements.  Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating.  The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.

	Acceptable-2	Meets all of the requirements.  Complete, comprehensive, and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements.

	Marginal-1	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal.  However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable."  (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Final Revisions" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.)  If award is made on initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions, nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable."

	Unacceptable-0	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many of the requirements.  (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)

5.  AWARD - BEST VALUE

	A.	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from an operational, technical and cost standpoint.  

	B.	Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of Defense Supplement (DFARS).  One contractor will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government.    

	C.	All evaluation factors are significantly important; however, the Government may elect to pay a price premium to select an Offeror whose operational and/or technical evaluation factors are superior.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.

***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Contractors may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) Scanning Head and Controller meeting or exceeding the following specifications:

(1) A stand-alone AFM scanner, electronic controller, and computer with software.  The AFM must be compatible with operation in a working SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), with minimal mutual degradation in performance.  For example, electromagnetic fields from the AFM must be minimized so that SEM resolution is not strongly degraded.  Quoters should either document operation of the AFM in an SEM and provide data on the SEM performance (including resolution) with and without AFM; or provide sufficient design data on the AFM to allow the stay electromagnetic fields generated by the AFM to be estimated.

(2) The AFM scanner shall have a lateral imaging range of at least 50 micrometers by 50 
micrometers, and a vertical range of at least 3 micrometers. Resolution of the X and Y axes should be at least 0.01 % of the maximum range or 5 nm, whichever is less, and Z axis resolution should be at least 0.01% of the maximum range or 0.3 nm, whichever is less;

(3) The AFM scanner shall be capable of measuring topographic features of a sample using contact and non-contact (dynamic or intermittent contact) mode.  It shall be capable of sampling other sample properties, in particular the electrostatic force when using a conductive AFM probe that is biased up to plus or minus 10 Volts relative to a sample.  It must also accept probes able to perform indentation and scratch experiments;

(4) The instrument must operate in atmosphere and be compatible for vacuum operation at pressures of one microtorr or less;

(5) The AFM must image a sample while the SEM scans the AFM.  This requires the pole piece of the SEM to approach within 12 mm of the AFM tip as defined below.  Therefore the unobstructed volume around the scanning tip must be large enough that a plane can approach to within 12 mm of the probe tip while the AFM scans a sample.  The point on the plane closest to the AFM probe tip must have an unobstructed view of the contact point between the probe and sample, and the line of sight to the probe tip must be perpendicular to the plane.  The AFM must also operate with the line of sight to the SEM vertical. 

(6) The resonant frequency of the scanner must be above 3kHz, and the thermal drift must be less than 5 nm/minute;

(7) For operation using optical beam deflection, the control electronics must operate with a 4-quadrant photo-sensor, and measure normal force as well as lateral force.  Operation using piezo cantilevers is also acceptable if all other requirements are met.  The control electronics must also perform measurements of force/distance curves, and allow for monitoring and/or modifying sensor and actuator input/output signals between the control unit and the AFM scanner. It must also be possible to use an external lock-in amplifier for non-contact mode imaging;

(8) The AFM must be small enough to be mounted within a volume 100 mm square by 40 mm high, with the probe tip centered on a point less than 25mm from the center of the 100 mm square area.

*** DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  Delivery shall be completed not later than 120 days from the date of award.

***FOB Destination means the Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  

***Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price.

*** Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  In evaluating technical capability that exceeds specifications, greatest consideration will be given to the following, in descending order of importance: (1) Performance of the AFM and SEM during simultaneous operation; (2) Minimum distance from the SEM pole piece to the AFM probe tip; (3) Scan performance (such as range, resolution, and ability to sample other properties); (4) Capabilities of the control electronics and software.

Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or information provided by NIST or its' affiliates.  Quoters shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Quoters with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.
