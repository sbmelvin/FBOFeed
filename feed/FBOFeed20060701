<DESC>In this Request for Information, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Denver Distribution Center (VADDC), is seeking information from firms capable of providing the technical and support services described herein.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a centralized program for the recovery of precious metals which supports the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) on Recovery of Precious Metals (41CFR101-45.1002 through 41CRF101-45.1004-1).  The VA would like to have each VA facility ship their silver bearing scrap and waste, e.g., passive cells and cathodes, photographic and x-ray film, silver alloys, and dental scrap to collection at one contractor’s site for receiving, processing, tracking, and records. In the past, the receipt, tracking and records were managed within the VA. One contractor received the x-ray film to be refined for silver and plastic content.  The Contractor would assay for silver content on each shipment, based on the market price of silver on the day of pick-up from the VA.  Three samples for each lot of material received were maintained for verification between the Contractor and VA, if necessary.  All by-products were totally recycled.  Items identified above, excluding x-ray film, were gathered and sold once a year to various contractors, based on the highest offer The VADDC is seeking suggestions or possible methods that could be used to accomplish this process with one National contract.  Interested parties should provide a detailed description for a method of silver recovery from scrap film and waste collected by electrolytic or passive recovery systems; tracking receipt, processing, and payments to VA; and provisions for accountability.  The information supplied in response to this notice will be used to develop an acquisition strategy.  Companies providing information must be capable of providing the services specified in their submission.   The VADDC is also seeking suggestions and possible solutions on providing assistance to the local field facility on the assessment and design of recovery systems, replacement of cathodes and passive cells, and environmental issues that may arise due to local and state environmental regulations and laws. VADDC anticipates release of a solicitation in October 2006.  The VA will not be responsible for any costs for the preparation of the responses to this request.  Responses are due by close of business on July 17, 2006.  Responses can be e-mailed to gail.hixon@va.gov or mailed to Contracting VADDC, PO Box 25166, Denver, CO 80225.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
