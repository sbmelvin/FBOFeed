<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to issue a Firm Fixed-Price modification to contract N68936-04-C-0008 to expand the Fiber Optic capability of the North Range using other than full and open competition.  Rocky Mountain Communication Specialties, 3411 N. Shore Drive, Loveland, CO  80537-9643 is currently installing fiber optic cable under this contract.  The additional work will include installation of approximately 17 miles of single-mode fiber optic cable, manholes, splice cases and fiber optic patch panels at the China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center North Test Ranges. The additional fiber optic capability to be completed will be directly connected to and fusion spliced to the fiber optic cable that is currently being installed, spliced and terminated under contract by Rocky Mountain Communications Specialties, Inc.  This work is a continuation of the capability currently under implementation at Parrot Peak, Etcheron Valley, and J-90.  The government intends to issue a modification to Rocky Mountain Communications Specialties existing contract because the government anticipates a potential duplication of the cost, since installation and heavy equipment to bury the cable will have to be shipped in to the job site.  At this time, Rocky Mountain Communications Specialties, Inc. has the necessary equipment located at the job site.  Fiber Optic Cable installation and testing shall be completed no later than 30 June 2004.  Interested parties shall identify their interest and capability and respond to this announcement by 16 April 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Basic Research Laboratory (BRL) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to propose a sole source contract with Brigham and Women's Hospital, Channing Laboratory, 181 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115 for the services to develop documentation of algorithms for the re-coding of data from "Maternal cohort study of the Nurses."  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The overall purpose of this procurement is to develop documentation of algorithms related to exposures in utero, in infancy, or early childhood will be examined in relation to recognized risk factors for women's cancers.  Mothers of the women (nurse daughters) have reported information about prenatal, postnatal, and early childhood events in a retrospective fashion and the maternal data are linked to two ongoing, large-scale prospective cohort studies, known as the Nurses' Health study I and II, including 40,000 nurses, who have reported data on recognized risk factors for cancer and who are being followed for diagnosis of incident cancers as well as mortality.  Maternal study data are also linked to data on risk factors such as age at menarche and adult height and obesity, which have been collected in the ongoing Nurses' Health Studies.  The results of the data documentation will lead to the data analysis of the Maternal Cohort Study, which will contribute to NCI's understanding of the potential role of birth weight and length and of infant feeding, i.e. early life exposures, on age at menarche and adult height in order to determine whether early life exposures are related to adult risk factors for cancer and potentially link critical periods of exposures for cancer in a woman's life cycle.  The overall objective is to determine whether fetal and early childhood exposures are related to risk factors for adult cancers in women, and to develop documentation of the recoding of major early life exposures such as gestational age and infant feeding from the Maternal Cohort Study; perform edit checks and assess the internal validity of the newly coded items for subsequent analysis of the data.   Period of Performance: May 14, 2004 - October 14, 2005.   The collaboration between Brigham and Woman's Hospital and NCI began in 1999.   Dr. Michels is the co-Principal Investigator on the Maternal Cohort Study and is a member of the original team.  She is responsible for testing specific hypothesis on the Maternal Cohort study, and has successfully maintained follow-up of the nurse daughters, once every two (2) years.  The nurse daughters are part of the Nurses Health Study I and II, who have been loyal participants with a high response rate of 95% over time.  The  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Channing Laboratory,  is the only source known to the NCI that is familiar with the original files from which the subset of data have been taken. Changing coding teams at this time would interrupt the interpretation of the study objectives.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, April 28, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the fabrication, testing, and installation of a new A-18 Control House (part #S11063) for the T-38 aircraft at Ellington Field. This requirement also calls for the removal and disposal of the existing A-18 Control House at Ellington Field.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Vital Link, Inc.  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source due to the fact that the above mentioned part number is an Air Force part number,and the manufacturer has to be to be approved by the United States Air Force T-38 Weapons Sytstems Department.  Vital Link, Inc is already approved by the United States Air Force to perform the work required for this part number.  Furthermore, since these units only require repair or replacement every 15-20 years there isn't a lot of business for this type of work.  Thus, Vital Link is the only company found after conducting our market research that is approved and performs the type of work required.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 19, 2004.

<DESC>The Gifford Pinchot National Forest is in the process of preparing a Request for Quotes for a road project located in the East Fork of the Lewis River.  USFS Rd 4200 is an existing single lane, gravel surfaced road constructed adjacent to the East Fork of the Lewis River.  This project is intended to reduce the amount of road generated sediment that reaches the East Fork, an important native fisheries stream.  This project is approximately 1 mile in length and is the first of several sediment-reducing / fisheries improvement projects anticipated over the next few years. This project is expected to advertise in the spring of 2004 and construct during the 2004 construction season, July 15 thru Sept 30.

SCOPE OF CONTRACT : The preliminary government estimate is between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000.

The primary focus of this sediment-reducing project is the existing gravel and native material subgrade. The existing subgrade will be reconditioned to remove existing pot holes and washboards and to increase usable width where necessary.  3 inch minus base rock will be added to short sections of the existing, reconditioned subgrade to improve drainage.  A 4 inch compacted depth lift of  ¾ inch minus crushed rock will be placed on top of the recon-ditioned subgrade.  The final surface will be a three-layer bituminous surface treatment (BST) consisting of clean, durable crushed rock and CRS2 emulsified asphalt.  Clean, high quality crushed rock is critical to this project and materials testing will be required as a part of this contract. 

Road generated sediment will be reduced and the expected life of the BST extended by improving the existing drainage features.  The existing ditches and culvert catch basins will be improved, new culverts and culvert inlet headwalls will be added to the drainage system, and an existing 42 inch dia culvert will be replaced with an 81 inch x 59 inch steel arch culvert.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with ITT Avionics of Clifton, NJ, for the Full Rate Production (FRP) of the AN/ALQ-214(V)2 Radio Frequency (RF) Jammer developed as a major subsystem within the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) Program.  The AN/ALQ-214(V)2 is a self-protection RF Jammer for tactical combat Navy aircraft against RF guided surface-to-air and air-to-air threats.  The AN/ALQ-214(V)2 subsystems are required for installation into the Navy’s F/A-18E/F.  In recognition of potential acquisition costs savings and pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.604, which supports the Navy’s right to pursue component breakout after initial production, the Navy intends to enter into direct sole-source negotiations with the designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AN/ALQ-214(V)2 subsystem—ITT Avionics.  

The FRP requirement includes procurement of an estimated quantity of 19 AN/ALQ-214(V)2 subsystems (FY04) and a priced option for an estimated quantity of 38 subsystems (FY05).  The contract will also require non-recurring engineering efforts to address production issues and engineering redesign efforts to address obsolescence issues.  Because additional testing may be required due to the redesign of obsolete parts, testing will also be included as an option.  The contract will also contain two options for spares identified by Navy Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) with estimated quantities as follows:  2 receivers, 3 modulators, 4 processors, 6 low band amplifiers, and 16 high band amplifiers for FY04 and 8 receivers, 7 modulators, 6 processors, 9 low band amplifiers, and 13 high band amplifiers for FY05.  ITT Avionics is the only source which possesses the knowledge, experience, facilities, skilled workforce, special test and inspection equipment, software tools, unique subcomponent production capability, and technical data to perform this effort within the required timeframe.  Negotiations will be conducted with ITT Avionics, 100 Kingsland Road, Clifton, NJ, 07014-1993.  This synopsis is for information only. See Note 22.  NAVAIR Synopsis 2211ID.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions as follows:
USDA/ARS SOLICITATION 09-3K06-04	
AMENDMENT ONE (1)

1. In listing the accommodation requirements, it says "2.January 20&24, 
2004: 780 rooms..."  Is the 24 a misprint that should read 22?  Could you 
please restate the number of rooms needed each night?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The Jan. 24 date is a typo and should reflect Jan. 22.

2. Will the 3 breakout rooms that will be used on January 20, 2004 that are 
to be set in a hollow square be used concurrently with the other 10 
breakout rooms, or will they be needed at separate times and could be 
reused (ie. hollow square arrangement for morning meetings, that could be reset for theater style in the afternoon)?

ANSWER:  Separate times.  In fact, we are likely not to use 10 breakout rooms on the 20th, only for the main part of the meeting 21-23.

3. In discussing concession requirements, it says, "4. Break/snack service 
for the afternoons of January 21 & 22, 2004 evening receptions."  Is it 
safe to assume that the PM breaks will be for 750-800 people like the AM 
break?  Also, are evening receptions planned and what date(s)?

ANSWER:  Yes afternoon will have same number as morning breaks.
Receptions: a welcoming reception with (perhaps) dessert and coffee Tuesday Jan. 20, informal receptions Jan 21 and 22 will entail cash bar service but no food.

4. How many hours of webcast per day is anticipated?

ANSWER:  We want to webcast all sessions, so roughly 8 hours

5. The RFQ calls for 10 video cameras.
  
   a. Because of the reference to WEB conference, are we correct in presuming that these would be digital video cameras?  ANSWER:   Yes

     b. Will all cameras be capturing in the same room, or will some of the break-out sessions be taped as well?   ANSWER:  We will use 1 camera per session (per room)

     c. How many simultaneous viewers (logins) are expected to view the live webcast? 
         ANSWER:  This is unknown, but could be significant (up to 5000).

     d. How many formats are required. Normally 2 formats are recommended--Windows Media and Real Networks.   ANSWER:   Yes

     e. How many bit-rates (speeds) would you like the content streamed at. Normally 56K for dial-up connections and at least one stream at a higher speed eg. 128K or higher for DSL is recommended. This should be determined through an analysis of the prospective viewers and the connection speeds available to them.  

ANSWER:  Most of our viewers will be on DSL as we are in government facilities.  We anticipate few, if any, dial in connections.  We would like our viewers, however, to have an option to indicate if they are on dial-up connections.

Additional info:   The Government IT Program Office commented that 56K seems a little high for dialup, 30K-40K would be more reasonable.


6 .On the paperwork you sent, it does not specify how many guestroom on the nights of January 22nd and 23rd?

ANSWER:  Jan. 22, 04: 730 rooms; Jan. 23, 04: Rooms are not required

7. For each meal, can you share your budget?  It might be best if
you tell me per person since your attendance numbers are a range. Same
for your breaks.

ANSWER:  Quoters may wish to propose alternate price meal plans so that we may have the option of choosing.   We don't want to share a budget.

8. AV for the Web cast...what type of AV will you need? How many
days and from what time to what time?  

ANSWER:   SEE ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4 ABOVE FOR WEB CAST.   As for days and time, all day 21-22, half day 23.


9. Lastly, to recap the number of rooms each night....your RFP says
starting Jan. 19th: 60, Jan. 20th, 730, Jan. 21st 780 rooms, Jan 22nd :
no rooms, Jan. 23rd: no rooms; Jna 24th: 730 rooms.

Required rooms should reflect: Jan. 19th: 60; Jan. 20th, 730; Jan. 21st 780 rooms; Jan 22nd, 730 rooms; Jan. 23rd: no rooms

NOTE:  THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT CHANGE THE DUE DATE OF OCT 1, 2003 FOR REQUEST FOR QUOTES.

provides wide area services to its users. The network is a combination of Time Division Multiplex (TDM) circuits, augmented with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Private Virtual Circuits (PVC) at key locations.

1.2 The scope of the prospective contract is to replace the existing TDM and ATM circuits, as well as to expand the TDM and ATM based transmission services by adding links to the existing network.

2. Project Description:

2.1	The purpose of this contract is to acquire a number of Leased
International Terrestrial Transmission Services, namely 2048 kbit/s El and 1544 kbit/s Ti links as well as Asynchronous Transmission Mode (ATM) Private Virtual Circuits (PVC) in support of NATO's General Purpose Communications System (NGCS). The transmission services shall be implemented by terrestrial means,

2.2 The network currently operated by NATO supports circuit mode services such as telephony and video teleconferencing (VTC) as well as packet mode services such as computer network communications. NATO's overall digital transmission services capability is currently provided through either existing (NATO owned) capabilities or through commercial leased services. As existing transmission includes NATO owned satellite capacity as well as transmission services provided by National Defense Networks (NDN), all commercially leased services shall be non satellite solutions to maintain the network grade and quality of service design parameters.

2.3 The services provided by the Contractor shall consist of delivery of the required TDM and ATM services as well as service monitoring facilities, commissioning activities, installation and testing, to meet all the requirements of the NGCS Transmission Services as detailed in the IEB.

2.4	It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to plan, design and perform the implementation at each location including the last mile. The implementation shall include preparations for and execution of installation, testing and activation/cut over for operational use,



2.5 In accordance with current NATO Funding mechanisms it is planned to sign the contract for a duration of 1 year starting from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC) with four (4) optional extensions of maximum 1(one) year each (i.e. the total duration will be between minimum of one (1) year and maximum of five (5) years).

3.	Summary of Services:

3.1 The table summarises the number of circuits required in each one of the two modalities (TDM and ATM) and an indication of the number of sites where the services will be provided. It must be considered that most of the NATO sites will require more than one connection point.


   NUMBER OF TRUNKS NUMBER SITES
TDM       120	      80                         
ATM	   50         11 	                                                            

3.2 In addition, Bidders should be aware of the following NATO requirements:

a.	Circuits will have termination points in different countries and in some cases ATM and TDM intercontinental links will be required.

b.	Termination points of some of the required circuits shall be in countries where NATO Forces or HQs are located. In addition, all the circuits shall be terminated on Bandwidth Management Equipment (BME) inside a NATO point of presence.

c.	In addition to the aforementioned circuits, the Bidder shall be required to propose Network Management visibility to allow monitoring of the performance of the end to end circuits.

Nominated bidders must have at least NATO Restricted Security Clearance in order to receive and process the IFB.  The successful contractor shalll be required to handle and store material at the level "NATO SECRET" and, should this be the case, the prospective contractor shall be required to have appropriate storage and handling clearances. Prospective bidders may be called upon to work at NATO or National defence site in conjunction with the contract and such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of "NATO SECRET."  All such clearances must be in place prior to contract award.

The overseas procurement office responsible for this project is Brussels, Belgium.  The work project is located in Brussels, Belgium.

Etta R. MUNFORD (BIS/OSIES/DPD) is the primary point of contact for interested U.S. firms regarding certification/eligibility procedures and/or questions.

<DESC>This is Modification No. 3 to the synopsis entitled "Metallic Test Article Development and General and Precision Machining (MTAGPM) Services", which was posted on December 15, 2003. The purposes of this modification are to notify prospective providers that:  (1) there is a special standard of responsibility for private sector offerors for this competition, which must be demonstrated for the private sector company to receive a critical part of the solicitation; (2) the NAICS code for this procurement is 33641 and the size standard under this code is 1,000 employees; and (3) the Government intends to utilize the Tradeoff Source Selection Process for this competition, as defined in OMB Circular A-76. The Government will release a workload portfolio as part of the Draft and Final Solicitations for the MTAGPM Services competition.  This workload portfolio will inlude a large number of actual historical MTAGPM tasks completed in Fiscal Year 2003. The portfolio will be provided on CD upon written request as specified below.  Receipt of the portfolio is critically important to a potential service provider's ability to submit a proposal. This portfolio will include specifications and drawings that are unclassified but are subject to the provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  In addition, many tasks to be performed under any contract resulting from this competition will involve access to data subject to the provisions of ITAR.	To receive the ITAR-restricted data in the portfolio and in order to be considered a responsible offeror, a private sector company must provide evidence that it is registered with the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.  The website for the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which sets forth the requirements and instructions for registration, is      http://www.pmdtc.org/reference.htm      The offeror must provide a copy of its registration letter received from the Department of State or provide its PM/DTC Code.  Additionally, the offeror must provide the name, telephone number, and contact address of the Empowered Official, as defined in Part 120.25 of the ITAR (22 CFR 120-130), who is authorized to receive and assume responsibility for the ITAR controlled workload portfolio.  The registration letter or PM/DTC code, and the Empowered Official's name, address, and telephone number must be provided before the workload portfolio can be provided.  The workload portfolio will be available upon release of the Draft Solicitation, which is currently scheduled for on or about April 30, 2004.  Interested parties are encouraged to provide the requested information to the Contracting Officer, Rosemary C. Froehlich, as soon as possible and prior to that date.  Responses are requested to be sent by e-mail, if possible.  If sending information by fax, please fax to 757-864-9043 instead of the number listed below. A proposal received from a company that is not registered with the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls on the date specified for receipt of offers shall be rejected as unacceptable. Documents related to this procurement (except the workload portfolio) will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/LaRC Business Opportunities home page is	   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=23	   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2

 This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This “Request for Information” is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  We intend to follow this RFI with the release of a draft RFP for industry comment.  A Statement of Objectives is attached.  Performance Specifications are currently being developed.  If a copy of the Performance Specification is needed for estimating purposes contact Juan Villarreal at 210-536-4907 or juan.villarreal@brooks.af.mil and a draft copy will be sentd.   
 The ALEP Block 2 device will protect against 7 laser wavelengths (4 in the visible spectrum and 3 in the invisible spectrum).  The device will provide peripheral protection, be compatible with life support equipment (LSE) and aircraft cockpits/cabins, be suitable for both day and night operation without adversely affecting mission capability or safety of flight, and accommodate vision correction.  Refer to the Statement of Objectives for more insight on the
2. What experience do you have with integrating eyewear/visors with aircraft cockpits/cabins and displays, LSE (Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) equipment, helmet mounted displays, oxygen masks, helmets, night vision goggles, etc.), and the Air Force maintenance/logistics system?

3. Briefly describe any past or present manufacturing experience your company has that is relevant to the type of product you envision developing to meet this requirement.  Also, describe your current and/or future production capability.

4. What is the most efficient approach (excluding contact lenses and eye surgery) for providing vision correction along with laser eye protection in the Block 2 device?

5. Do you have experience in working with Government Test Agencies or Laboratories?  If so, describe those efforts, the time frame, and the specific Government agencies involved.

Integration Contractors:
1. How much experience do you have as a prime integrator for laser eye protection products?  (e.g., Integrating laser eye protection technologies (absorptive, reflective, etc) with lenses, frames, and visors, performing analysis of the design, and testing the final product.)

2. Identify the risks associated with executing the ALEP Block 2 Concept and Technology Development (C&TD) effort.  What are the mitigation plans for those risks?

3. What would you estimate the period of performance and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for the ALEP Block 2 C&TD effort?

4. Identify the risks associated with executing the ALEP Block 2 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort.  What are the mitigation plans for those risks?

5. What would you estimate the period of performance and a ROM cost for the ALEP Block 2 SDD phase?

6. In a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract, what incentives would interest you?  Do you anticipate any risks with this type of contract?  If so, what are the risks?

Filter/Dye Contractors:
1. What wavelength(s)/wavelength range(s) are you capable of protecting against and using what technology?

2. Can you design laser absorptive dyes with high photopic luminance transmission in both the visible and invisible wavelength spectrum?  What percent transmissions can you achieve and at what wavelength(s) and optical density?

3. How would you protect the sides of the eyeball from laser strikes without hindering peripheral vision but still providing laser eye protection?  What is the maximum face form angle you can provide with laser eye protection, side protection, and LSE compatibility?

4. For laminated lenses/visors, what temperature and humidity ranges can your product survive?

5. Are you able to provide non-dye laser protection on a non-laminated (single piece) lens/visor?  If so, do you have a sufficiently durable hard-coat that would protect the laser protection filter?  What temperature and humidity ranges can your non-laminated product survive?

<DESC>The Army Field Support Command intends to competitively solicit from the private sector an operating arrangement that will achieve the following objectives:  A. reserve at all times, the nation's ability to produce and/or procure its Warfighters' pri mary service ammunition, 5.56mm, 7.62mm and .50 Caliber in its primary configurations, ball, traced and blank. B. Obtain the critical provisions to support the military missions.  It is a National imperative to maintain the ability to acquire small caliber  ammunition in an environment where projected requirements are expected to increase for the foreseeable future.  Increasing military contingencies have created a situation where the capability to produce small caliber ammunition through conventional method s has been fully exercised.  A Systems Integrator is anticipated to remedy the current situation by arranging for capability to deliver up to 300 million rounds per year for a five-year period to the US Government. Quantities could increase up to 500 milli on per year. The AFSC is seeking sources interested in the Systems Integrator concept.  To that extent, the Army intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  A competitive award of a firm fixed price contract for establishment of the Systems Integrator, follo wed by firm fixed price options/delivery orders for small caliber ammunition, with the source that provides the best value proposal to the formal RFP is anticipated.     An industry day will be held at the RiverCenter, Davenport, Iowa on 18 May 2004 beginning at 0900 hours.  At that time industry questions will be addressed and considered.  Sources interested in attending the industry day must contact the Contracting Offic er, Ms. Susan McKinnis, with the name of your firm and the number of personnel attending, by 16 April 2004 at AMSFS-CCA-F, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000, (309)782-7345, or susan.mckinnis@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Recovery Tool: Accurately measures swelling and shrinkage (strain) of CBM reservoir core samples for enhanced modeling and production planning.  This new tool is a breakthrough in speed (1 week), accuracy, and reliability replacing previously used methods that take months to achieve the first data point and up to a year to complete a full-scale test.  This novel tool offers data useful in modeling CBM production through reservoir flooding or stimulation, improving optimized resource production.  A bench scale model has demonstrated a simple, low cost, and quick (1 week) method of determining the amount of coal matrix strain, as a function of pore pressure and gas composition.  The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is soliciting interest from coal, natural gas, and industry service companies capable of developing and manufacturing this tool.  The purpose of this joint collaboration would be to develop a field scale model for licensing and commercialization.  At the conclusion of the development project, the participating firm may seek up to an exclusive field of use license for patented and patent pending intellectual property developed under this project.

<DESC>Student Tracking System

1. Objective.  The Government is seeking information on a possible requirement for a system to track students during field exercises in a wooded environment and provide instantaneous information to the cadre to locate and retrieve those students.  There are two requirements, one for a system to track 500 students and the other system to track 400 students.  

2. Current Process.  Currently, instructors patrol the roads inside and on the perimeter of the exercise area to locate lost, injured or cheating students.  At the end of each exercise, these instructors continue to patrol roads to pick up students who have not completed the exercise in time.  This process continues until all students are located.  Although, if, after two hours after the end of the exercise, all students are not located, instructors will then begin retracing all lost students’ routes on foot.  If after four hours the students are not found, instructors will begin searching the area one kilometer on either side of the route the student should have taken. If after eight hours the student is still not found, air assets are brought to aid with the search.  This process continues until the student is found

This method is extremely manpower intensive and has an adverse effect on training, cadre and student welfare.  

3.  Requirement. A student tracking system that will provide accurate real-time location data to the cadre.   One cadre tracking device will be located at a central command location and monitor the entire training area.  The second device will be a hand-held device that every cadre in the field uses to track individual students.  Batteries need to be rechargeable and include a system to rapidly recharge all batteries

The student devices must:
1.	Be small, lightweight and easily carried by student
2.	Be at least splashproof
3.	Shock Resistant
4.	Support two-way communications
5.	Batteries must last at least 24 hours
6.	GPS and GPM capable
7.	GPS data not viewable on device
8.	Operate in temperatures of 20-55 degrees Celsius
9.	Range approximately 15 kilometers

The Cadre Tracking Device must :
1.	Accept GSM and GPS input
2.	Have reliable coverage in the NTA, Camp MacKall and Hoffman training areas
3.	Provide GPS data viewable on a receiving station
4.	Receiving station no larger than a standard laptop
5.	Display should be graphic using terrain/map overlay of training area
All information may be provided to Karen Glass, glasska@soc.mil or fax(910)432-9345.  Recommend contact via email, however, my phone is (910) 432-6145.  Requests for oral presentation of information will be accommodated if possible.

<SUBJECT>A -- Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Multimegawatt Electric Power System (MEPS) Program
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate, Power Division (AFRL/PRP) is announcing its’ intent to conduct an Industry Day for the Power and Thermal Technologies For Air And Space--Multimegawatt Electric Power System (PTTAS-MEPS) Program on Thursday, 13 May 2004 at the Hope Hotel Conference Center in Fairborn Ohio, near Wright-Patterson AFB.  Industry Day will consist of two sessions.  The first session will be a program overview presentation to all conference attendees and will begin at 0800.  The second session will consist of one-on-one discussions between the Government and interested parties/firms.  These one-on-one sessions will be by appointment only.  Appointments will begin immediately following conclusion of the Industry Day briefing and may overflow to the next day depending upon the number of responses received. 
The objective of the PTTAS-MEPS program is to develop and ground test a power system for airborne directed energy weapons.  The power system includes the gas turbine drive, superconducting generator, and power conditioning system.  The emphasis of the effort will be on the superconducting generator with an initial demonstration by the end of 2007 and a full power demonstration by the end of 2009 in an overall power system.  The gas turbine shall be an existing gas turbine.  The power conditioning system shall be traceable to a lightweight, efficient aircraft design, but for this effort is not required to meet these specifications.  The Government anticipates one contract award with an estimated value of $22M for an approximate 5-year program

<SUBJECT>76-- License for Human Protein Reference Database
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD for a license to use, incorporate, and distribute data from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD).  The HPRD is a data resource of protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, enzyme-substrate relationships and disease associations.  The information has been derived by experts using bioinformatics analytic tools but principally from a critical reading and review of the peer-reviewed journal literature.  The annotations for individual proteins identifies the types of protein interactions, the regions of interaction, the types of experiments showing modification of substrates by enzymes, the analysis of motifs and domains, and subcellular localization.  HPRD uses a controlled vocabulary which facilitates interoperability and common search interfaces.  The data are available in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) which preserves the hierarchical structure of the database during the import/export of data.  The purpose of this acquisition is to enhance the current content of databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the NLM.  NCBI produces and distributes through its RefSeq database, an information resource of integrated, non-redundant, and highly annotated sequence data for genomic DNA, transcripts, and protein products from major research organisms.  Through licensing HPRD data, NCBI will be able to significantly enhance the annotation of functional information for human proteins within RefSeq.  HPRD information will be a valuable addition to the RefSeq database since it currently does not cover in depth protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, enzyme/substrate relationships, curated domain predictions, tissue distribution, subcellular localization and disease associations.  There are currently over 6500 proteins annotated in HPRD with an additional 3000 expected within the next 10 months.  There are over 12,000 protein-protein interactions annotated and over 100,000 links to journal literature in PubMed. Updating and creation of new entries occurs on a continuing basis; all data developed and revised shall be made available for electronic transfer to NCBI on a daily basis.  The content of the HPRD database is copyrighted by the Johns Hopkins University and use of the data will be purchased as a commercial item subject to a non-exclusive licensing agreement.  Because of the comprehensiveness of the data and the thoroughness of its annotation, and because the Johns Hopkins University owns the rights to the data, it has been determined that the University of Washington is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM’s requirements.  The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within twenty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires professional, comprehensive, and confidential counseling and referral services for USUHS employees for a wide range of personal problems (e.g., alcohol abuse, drug abuse, financial, personal, emotional, psychological, marital, family, legal, stress related, etc.); the prevention and resolving of employees drug use through active participation in the USUHS Civilian Employee Drug Testing Program; counseling and referral services to families of USUHS employees with personal problems and to USUHS employees whose family members have personal problems; on-going publicity/promotion of the employee assistance program and services; employee (both supervisory and non-supervisory) orientation, education, and training relative to the employee assistance program and services; statistical data gathering and analysis sufficient to satisfy Agency reporting requirements; and an end-of-the-contract year cost/benefit analysis. The objective of this effort is to assist the USUHS in meeting legal and regulatory requirements in the establishment, operation, maintenance, and evaluation of an effective and comprehensive employee assistance program, that is beyond current in-house support capabilities. USUHS has a total of approximately 780 civilian employees. Any contractor responding to this proposal must have the previous experience and resources necessary to handle the number and type of problems arising in such a generally technical but diverse workforce. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  A. Counseling: 1) The contractor shall provide at no charge to the client up to three personal counseling sessions per client (i.e., USUHS employee and or employee family member), per problem, unless the problem warrants immediate referral to an outside resource for treatment, rehabilitation, therapy, etc. The contractor may seek an exception to the three sessions maximum when: (a) counseling results from a supervisory referral and an additional session is needed; and (b) counselor determines that there is a compelling clinical need for an additional session to appropriately assess and refer the employee for longer term counseling. Before providing an additional session, the contractor must obtain approval from the Government. 2) The contractor shall provide access to an experienced professional, credentialed employee assistance counselor off-site by appointment (within a 10 mile radius of worksite), as part of the three personal counseling sessions in Paragraph A.1, at no charge to the client. 3) The contractor shall provide local telephone access to an experienced professional, credentialed employee assistance counselor 24 hours per day, seven days per week, at no charge to the client. Emergency long distance client calls for counseling will be authorized and paid for by the University only when local counselors are unavailable and with the prior approval of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). 4) The contractor shall have a counseling staff that as a whole has the expertise to provide assistance on a broad range of problems. Counseling expertise in the area of alcohol, drug abuse and AIDS is mandatory. Expertise in other areas of counseling, such as personal, emotional/psychological, stress&#64979;related, marital, family, legal, and financial problems is highly desirable. Counselor and contractor qualifications will be demonstrated in professional resumes. 5) If a supervisory referral is made, the contractor shall consult with supervisor and personnel office representatives, as appropriate, on actions to assist in resolving the problem. 6) The contractor shall seek feedback on the services rendered from clients who participate in the program. The contractor will share this feedback with the COR, ONLY if the clients have authorized this in writing. If the clients do not authorize consent, then the contractor isn't required to release this information to the COR. B. Civilian Employee Drug Testing Program: 1) General: The contractor shall play an important role in preventing and resolving employee drug use by demonstrating USUHS' commitment to eliminating illegal drug use; providing employees an opportunity with appropriate assistance to discontinue their drug use; providing educational materials and training to supervisors, managers and employees on drug issues; assist supervisors in confronting employees use who have performance and/or conduct problems and making referrals to appropriate treatment and rehabilitative facilities; and follow&#64979;up with individuals during the rehabilitative period to track their progress and encourage successful completion of the program. The contractor, however, shall not be involved in the collection of urine samples or the initial reporting of test results. Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for the following: (a) Becoming familiar with the provisions of Executive Order 12564, "Drug Free Federal Workplace" and Federal Personnel Manual Letters 792&#64979;16 and 792&#64979;17 "Establishing a Drug Free Federal Workplace"; (b) Providing counseling and assistance to employees who self&#64979;refer for treatment or whose drug tests have been confirmed positive, and monitoring the employees' progress through treatment and rehabilitation; (c) Providing needed education and training to all levels of USUHS employees on: types and effects of drugs, symptoms of drug use and its impact on performance and conduct, relationship of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) with the drug testing program, and related treatment, rehabilitation, and confidentiality issues; (d) Ensuring that confidentiality of test results and related medical treatment and rehabilitation records is maintained in accordance with BRIEFINGS, RECORDS, REPORTS, DATA, and OTHER DELIVERABLES. 2.) Voluntary Referral: Employees may contact the contractor themselves, or may be referred by their supervisors, for help in obtaining counseling and treatment for a drug abuse problem. USUHS encourages employees who use illegal drugs to voluntarily seek counseling and other appropriate assistance. When feasible, the contractor must also be available to families of employees with drug problems, and to employees with family members who have drug problems. A supervisor wishing to refer an employee to the contractor should discuss his or her concerns with the employee, suggest the need for assistance, and offer to contact the contractor to arrange an appointment. Employees are not required to pursue this type of supervisory referral to the contractor. 3) Mandatory Referral:  (a) Employees who are found to use illegal drugs will be referred to the contractor for assessment, counseling, and if appropriate, referred to an outside source for treatment or rehabilitation. This mandatory referral to the EAP counselor shall be in addition to any other applicable personnel actions, and will be made with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security. Employee participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs provided by or referred through the contractor does not preclude USUHS from taking any disciplinary action authorized upon a finding of illegal drug use including removal from the Federal service and revocation of security clearance; (b) Once a referral to the USUHS EAP is made, and the employee agrees to the appointment with the counselor the contractor will encourage but not require the employee to sign consent for release of information to the supervisor. This consent will cover the release of information pertaining to the employee's compliance with the agreed upon treatment plan and the employee's progress during and at the end of treatment. The counselor shall assess the problem(s), review the employee's health insurance coverage and refer the individual to an appropriate treatment resource in the Community. The EAP contractor is not responsible for payment of treatment and rehabilitation expenses incurred by employees attending outside treatment resources. The counselor shall monitor the employees’ treatment and if consent for release of information was signed, keep the supervisor advised as to the progress being made. The counselor shall periodically follow&#64979;up with the employee and his/her supervisor after any treatment, which occurs and offer support and assistance as needed. 4) External Programs: The contractor has the responsibility for referring the employee to a treatment and rehabilitative program. The Chief, Civilian Personnel Division, USUHS, has the authority to disapprove a program not recommended by the contractor, and the employee is required to sign a release form which allows the contractor to monitor the rehabilitative progress and subjects the employee to subsequent follow&#64979;up testing. 5) Outside Referral: The contractor shall: (a) Maintain and update as necessary a list of rehabilitative or treatment organizations which provide counseling and rehabilitative programs for drug and alcohol abuse. This list shall be provided to the University upon request and shall include the following: (i) Name, address, and telephone number of the facility; (ii) Types of services provided; (iii) Hours of operation, including emergency hours; (iv) The contact person's name and telephone; (v) Fee structure, including insurance coverage; (vi) Client specialization; (vii) Other pertinent information. (b) Periodically visit rehabilitative or treatment organizations to meet administrative and staff members, tour the site, and ascertain the experience, certification, and educational level of staff, and the organizations policy concerning progress reports on clients and post&#64979;treatment follow up. A report of such visit will be provided to the COR with the contractor's findings and recommendations within 30 calendar days after completion of the visit. (c) Make client referrals to professional specialists, clinics, programs etc., as appropriate for treatment/rehabilitation, not affiliated with the contractor (arms length&#64979;&#64979;no conflict of interest) when: (i) Client's problem is not resolved in the three counseling sessions provided by contractor; (ii) Client requests referral to outside specialists, clinics rehabilitation facilities, hospitals, and/or drug & alcohol programs. (iii) Immediate referral of client to outside source is necessary, because the nature of the problem is such that the contractor counseling would unnecessarily delay commencement of needed regular treatment not within capability of contractor to provide. (d) The contractor shall offer the client at least two outside referral sources and shall indicate which outside sources are free of charge, sliding fee scale, and UCR (usual, customary and reasonable charge) scale. In making referrals, the contractor shall consider the nature and severity of the problem, location of the treatment, cost of the treatment, intensity of the treatment environment, availability of inpatient/outpatient care, other special needs such as transportation and childcare, and the preference of the employee. 6. Follow Up: (a) The contractor shall follow up with the client who has been referred to an outside source by the contractor within one month of the referral and if necessary, periodically during subsequent treatment, to evaluate the client's progress and adequacy of treatment by outside source.  (b) The contractor shall seek written feedback on client satisfaction with referrals, and shall share such feedback with the COP, only after written consent is obtained from the client to release this information. If consent is not given then the contractor shall not reveal this information. In the event the employee is not satisfied with the program of treatment or rehabilitation, such employee may seek review of the contractor's referral by notifying the Employee Management Relations Division, USUHS, prior to completion of the program. The decision of Employee Management Relations Division, USUHS, with the concurrence of the Chief, Civilian Human Resource Management, USUHS, will be final and will not be subject to further administrative review. (c) Upon request and with concurrence of the University, USUHS will provide statistical data not prohibited from release by law, rule, or regulation, which is necessary for reports or effective program management.(d) Upon request and with the written concurrence of employee, the University will furnish information concerning the employee’s personal history that is maintained by the University as long as the information is not prohibited from release by law, rule, or regulation.

<DESC>This amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation is to incorporate additional information into the description of the requirement to install cameras at Dover AFB.  

All cameras must be sealed for outdoor use.  Only one camera is inside a building however, the building is a wash rack for vehicles and potentially the cameras can get wet.  The next clarification is in regards to the amount of blacktop that must be removed and replaced to accomplish the installation.  The shortest distance from the washrack to the adjacent building is 60 feet.  The contractor will need to install wires under the blacktop and return it to its original condition.  The contractor can expect to run approximately 100 feet of cable to each camera.  This measurement is offered as a courteous but may or may not be all inclusive of the final amount.  The contractor is expected to provide a working system with the proposal.  Lastly, the contractor is expected to document all assumptions made in the proposal to arrive at the stated quote price.  These assumptions will be used to validate the contractors bid.

MINUTES OF PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE

Personnel in attendance of the stated conference are listed per the attached record of attendance.

Mrs. Bradford opened the meeting by stating SOFARS clause 5652.215-9001, Notice of Pre-proposal Conference, which is now added per Amendment 0002, as is this document to solicitation H92239-02-R-0002.  For clarification purposes, interested vendors were provided questions which were due by 6 April 04 and responses were posted on the eve of   April 04.  As responses were received late, copies of questions and answers were available to vendors during the conference. 

Vendors were offered the opportunity to ask questions to clarify the proposal as follows:

Question:  Resumes:  Are they to be the standard 2 page?
Answer:  Short resumes are fine.  If a 10-page resume is submitted for one person, that is fine, but will not expect 10 page resumes for four or five people.

Question:  Past performance:  If in the arena of need for the contract, will this be sufficient?  Answer:  It will need to show expertise and defend at top level.  Will need creditable expertise wherever making a claim.

Question:  Do we want publications as a part of this?
 Answer:  Initially maybe not, but research needs to guide this.  Task will become harder as there will be more languages.  Research needs to guide the results.  Will need the most effective way given the effective constraints.  The results must be defensible at the academic/peer review level.  The vendor credentials are important to the credibility of the results and the results must be accomplished using industry standard approaches, methods etc.  Results should be of a quality that they could easily be developed into an article suitable for publications in the appropriate scholarly journals.

Question:  Is this only research and analysis?
Answer:  It is not to design training or ensure that people receive effective training.
Clarification:  This then is to:  1) Design Research Program; 2) Execute Program; 3) Do analysis.  4) Publish report to include recommended solution sets/courses of action.  RESPONSE:  Exception- Only if can’t figure out because of metrics.  Metrics may be on both sides.

Question:  Should program be completed developed in Proposal?  
Answer:  It is not a standalone.  

Question:  Are Research and Analysis portion the only tasks?
Answer:  No, the analysis must also yield recommendations.  Also, there may be a requirement to institute metrics to support the research effort.  

Question:  Are there any models?  Answer:   Will look at qualifications of instructor, student characteristics and education.  May want to evaluate the PC Tiller program.

Question:  What percent is research and what percent is analysis?
Answer:  The vendor must achieve the desired outcomes which are valid, defensible recommendations on how to improve the language programs within SOCOM to produce sufficient language capable operators to meet operational requirements.  It is not possible to quote percentages.

Question:  Are data capabilities in place?
Answer:  Contractor is responsible for providing this where existing capabilities do not support the project.

The US Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg North Carolina has a requirement to provide a Language Training Program Analysis and Long-Range Surveying Device for the Special Operations Forces Language Office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and transportation unless stated in the specifications.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. All quotes shall reference the Request for Quotation number H92239-04-R-0002. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-20. It is the Contractor's responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990. The size standard is $6,000,000. This requirement is a total 100% set-aside for small business.  A firm fixed price contract will be issued with a base period and four option periods. A Pre-proposal Conference is scheduled for Thursday, 8 April 2004, 1:00 p.m., HQ USASOC, Bldg E-2929, DCSRM Conference Room 252, Fort Bragg, NC. The contractor shall provide the following:  All personnel and services necessary to conduct the survey program of research analysis of the current Special Operations Forces (SOF) language training programs.  Ensure that SOF personnel receive effective language training to achieve the language skill levels necessary to effectively meet the requirements of their missions.  Design an integrated program which means a program that addresses all needs start to finish to provide SOF personnel effective language training.  This would integrate initial, sustainment, and enhancement training for all flavors of SOF (Army/Navy/AF) and all components (AC/RC).  Currently some SOF receive institutional training in their qualification courses and then sustainment and enhancement training at the unit.  Most SOF get 100% of their training at the unit.  So, the integrated program would take into account all other (non-language) SOF training requirements and propose a solution that is integrated both in terms of initial, sustainment and enhancement language training and in terms of the qualification and at unit training that SOF go through. The contractor shall provide a survey process that will utilize commonly accepted industry methodologies and practices to conduct the survey, which will analyze, but not be limited to, such factors as initial acquisition, sustainment and enhancement language training programs throughout the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  As a minimum, the process will assess available historical data; the relationship between service member Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) and their subsequent language proficiency; instructor qualifications and training materials; instructional methodologies; a longitudinal study of factors effecting skills retention; utility of computer-based and Distributive Learning in language training; and initial acquisition training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWCS).  Results:  This work will create a systemic approach and data to aid in military decision making on the following:  a) best methodology for efficient and cost effective conduct of SOF Foreign Language acquisition and sustainment training, b) best way to select individuals for specific language to be taught, c) metrics required to effectively monitor and adjust training programs.  Note: all assertions/conclusions must be supported.

Projects:  (there may be separate projects, a single project or several-the vendor may determine that certain SOF can be "lumped" together:  Provide empirically based research that documents the effectiveness of existing and new techniques for providing initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training.  The research will analyze the total cost (instructors, materials, overhead, travel, training time, training development, etc.) of initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training used by USSOCOM.   This training is done through military institutions, unit language labs, academic institutions, distributed learning, one-on-one tutoring, and a host of other methods.   This information will then be used to compare results in terms of Defense Language Proficiency Tests (DLPT) scores, training time, DLAB scores and target scores.  All training methods and types considered must be feasible (e.g. very few SOF personnel can or will attend 4 hours of class after their normal duty day to acquire a new language).  We also need recommendations on what metrics are needed and when/where they should be measured.  Specifically, the final product should address the following:  1.What is (are) the most cost effective initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training method(s) or type(s) for RC Army SF?  AC Army SF? AC Navy SOF?  AC Air Force SOF?  RC Army CA?  AC Army CA?  RC Army PSYOP?  AC Army PSYOP?

Vendors were offered the opportunity to ask questions to clarify the proposal as follows:

Question:  Resumes:  Are they to be the standard 2 page?
Answer:  Short resumes are fine.  If a 10-page resume is submitted for one person, that is fine, but will not expect 10 page resumes for four or five people.

Question:  Past performance:  If in the arena of need for the contract, will this be sufficient?  Answer:  It will need to show expertise and defend at top level.  Will need creditable expertise wherever making a claim.

Question:  Do we want publications as a part of this?
 Answer:  Initially maybe not, but research needs to guide this.  Task will become harder as there will be more languages.  Research needs to guide the results.  Will need the most effective way given the effective constraints.  The results must be defensible at the academic/peer review level.  The vendor credentials are important to the credibility of the results and the results must be accomplished using industry standard approaches, methods etc.  Results should be of a quality that they could easily be developed into an article suitable for publications in the appropriate scholarly journals.

Question:  Is this only research and analysis?
Answer:  It is not to design training or ensure that people receive effective training.
Clarification:  This then is to:  1) Design Research Program; 2) Execute Program; 3) Do analysis.  4) Publish report to include recommended solution sets/courses of action.  RESPONSE:  Exception- Only if can’t figure out because of metrics.  Metrics may be on both sides.

Question:  Should program be completed developed in Proposal?  
Answer:  It is not a standalone.  

Question:  Are Research and Analysis portion the only tasks?
Answer:  No, the analysis must also yield recommendations.  Also, there may be a requirement to institute metrics to support the research effort.  

Question:  Are there any models?  Answer:   Will look at qualifications of instructor, student characteristics and education.  May want to evaluate the PC Tiller program.

Question:  What percent is research and what percent is analysis?
Answer:  The vendor must achieve the desired outcomes which are valid, defensible recommendations on how to improve the language programs within SOCOM to produce sufficient language capable operators to meet operational requirements.  It is not possible to quote percentages.

Question:  Are data capabilities in place?
Answer:  Contractor is responsible for providing this where existing capabilities do not support the project.

Question:  Do you want contractor to put database for survey in place or will someone else do so?  Answer:  Yes, the contractor is to provide but include as a separate deliverable.  Show what you think is needed.

Question:  Does survey have to be in .mil?   Answer:  The desired method for conducting the survey(s) is to have participants log in via AKO (.mil) in order to take the survey(s).

Question:  Will the contractor need to cost this?  Answer:  Yes, cost it out.

Question:  When is the program/survey expected to be in place?
Answer:  It will be expected to be deployed 2-3 weeks after contract award, but if this is found to be unreasonable, please state in proposal what is reasonable and as well provide cost.

Question:  Will metrics become institutionalized?
Answer:  They will be strategic and tactical.  Part of the solutions sets should be recommendations as to what metrics must be installed and retained to adequately gage/measure program success/failure.

As submitted and identified by an attending vendor and appreciated by the government, the following outlines the  projects (additional, inclusive/or supporting) which were discussed during the conference and are included as tasks for this project:

1.	Provide empirically based research that documents the effectiveness of existing language training programs and provide documentation as to the effectiveness of all proposed new techniques for providing initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement
