<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-12-01404 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(13) exceptions:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards the required NATO security clearance certifications to the MOD-TUR.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>

<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit a completed one-time NATO ICB application) no later than 07 November 2012</p>
<p>- IFB planned to be issued December 2012</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) on behalf of Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dam Neck intends to procure on a sole source basis, PCI high speed express modules from Innovative Integration.  
Innovative Integration is located at 2390-A Ward Avenue, Simi Valley, CA  93065.
  The equipment to be provided are sixty (60) each PCI high speed express modules; P/N 80279-11A-L1. 

This procurement is sole sourced based on FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MEDICARE CURRENT BENEFICIARY SURVEY (MCBS)<br /><br /></span></strong>SURVEY DESIGN, SAMPLING, AND COMPUTER ASSISTED PERSONAL INTERVIEWING (CAPI) DATA COLLECTION CONTRACTOR<br /><br /><strong>General Information:<br /><br /></strong>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the required services for The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Although it is our intent to seek out small businesses, submission from all other qualified businesses will be accepted.<br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote, or other solicitation, and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. <br /><br />This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. <br /><br /><strong>Project Background:<br /><br /></strong>The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The MCBS is a national, multi-purpose, in person survey of a representative sample of the Medicare population. The survey has been continuously fielded since September 1991. <br /><br />The data collected in the MCBS are obtained through a complex, multistage sample design that involves stratification, clustering, and oversampling of specific population subgroups. First, 107 primary sampling units (PSUs) are selected to represent the nation, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, followed by 1,258 geographic clusters (defined by ZIP Code initially drawn within those PSUs). The Medicare enrollment file is then used to produce the final selection and ensure that the sample is representative of the Medicare population as a whole. The resulting sample size is designed to yield up to 16,000 unique respondents for a given year. Sample persons are interviewed three times a year over four years to form a continuous profile of their health care experience. In 2011, for example, 45,406 in-person interviews were fielded, of which 41,701 interviews were completed.
<p>In addition, the MCBS is a longitudinal rotating panel survey. Each year a new panel of survey participants is added to the survey and one panel is retired. Sample persons are interviewed three times each year over a four year period using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing methodology. These surveys form a continuous profile of each Medicare beneficiary's personal health care experience. The MCBS is thus uniquely capable of tracking changes in coverage and other personal circumstances, and observing processes that occur over time, such as people leaving their homes and taking up residence in long-term care facilities, or spending down their assets for medical care until they become eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>CMS is seeking creative and innovative approaches towards implementing MCBS in the future, while consistently ensuring that: 1) the data collected be nationally representative and scientifically sound, valid and reliable. Once the data are collected, they are cleaned, validated, and aggregated to develop comprehensive data sets. These data are then transmitted to CMS and/or its Designees. 2) the data collection remain uninterrupted to assure consistency and continuity. Due to the comprehensive nature of this data collection and the vulnerable nature of the survey population, three data collection periods per year are used to address likely respondent recall limitations. This methodology requires strict adherence to the timeline.</p>

<p>The NIH, ORIS is conducting market research to identify sources that have the combination of experience in: <br />&bull; Develop, Analyze, and Refine draft biomedical category concept listings and definitions.<br />&bull; Manual extraction of text from grant or contract applications and placement of the information into various database or worksheets.<br />&bull; Develop and Maintain category documentation in the office SharePoint wiki pages and shared folders.<br />&bull; Facilitate research category sessions with NIH biomedical category experts.<br />&bull; Curate and revise thesaurus (structured based on UMLS).<br />&bull; Facilitate and conduct annual maintenance review and analyses for completed category definitions and project listings for public display.<br />&bull; Facilitate analysis of category/other related data.<br />&bull; Facilitate training sessions on text mining and reporting systems, policies, processes and tools to NIH community. <br />&bull; Analyze system deficiencies, defects, bugs, and errors and collaborate with other ORIS staff and contractors to coordinate improvements.<br />&bull; Develop documentation to support project goals, track required tasks and provide meeting support as required.</p>
<p><br />The current contract can support up to 6 FTEs. Each year NIH reports how much it spends on various diseases, conditions, and other research areas. This information is presented in various budget documents, as well as on the NIH web site and in response to ad hoc requests from within the Executive Branch, Congress, constituent groups, and others. Within the NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs), research spending on individual projects is analyzed by experts to categorize them, and the total dollar amounts are compiled by category within each IC and across all ICs. The coding of research activity is not only a very labor-intensive process but the results, which are based on subjective analyses by many individuals, do not have the desired degree of robustness, consistency, transparency, and cannot be quickly replicated as expected by Executive Branch officials, Congress, the press, and constituency groups. The Research, Condition and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system will semi-automate the process of categorization and provide greater consistency, robustness, and transparency of NIH's RCDC Reporting.</p>
<p>The ORIS expects to conduct a competitive acquisition and award a contract no later than July 2013. The contract type will be Labor Hour tasks.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/MARKET SURVEY NOTICE FOR CIMOTS/COLDS

This is a sources sought synopsis for Contractor Instruction, Maintenance, Operation and Training Support (CIMOTS) for the Strategic Sealift Cargo Offload and Discharge Systems (COLDS) in support of Logistics Over the Shore and Joint Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS/JLOTS) objectives as well as related requirements for other government agencies. The principal place of performance of this contract is San Diego, California. The contractor will be required to provide instructional training (including high and medium risk), training management, maintenance, operational and training support services, to include Mobile Training Teams (MTT) for government students using government furnished equipment, material and methodologies to produce a graduate who satisfies the Fleet readiness and Strategic COLDS mission and various other requirements (see below - COLDS Major Capabilities Statement).

Contractor shall be responsible for the Cargo Offload and Discharge System (COLDS) which is the major Naval system for in-stream cargo offload and discharge.
  The background of the COLDS program is that it has two major subsystems: the cargo offloading and transfer system (COTS) for dry cargo and the off-shore bulks fuel system (OBFS) for liquid cargo.  Navy COLDS equipment and facilities include Lighterage,  Warping Tugs, Powered Modules, Causeway Ferries, Floating Piers, Roll-On/Roll-Off (RO/RO) Discharge Facilities (RRDF), and Elevated Causeway Expeditionary Pier.  Liquid cargo offload is supported by the Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) and the Offload Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS).  COLDS supports Logistics-Over-The-Shore (LOTS) operations, the loading and unloading of Marine Corps Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) and Assault Follow-On Echelon (AFOE) ships in the absence of established port facilities.
  LOTS operations can be conducted over unimproved shorelines, through fixed ports not accessible to deep draft vessels, and through fixed ports that are inadequate without the use of LOTS capabilities.
Executing LOTS requires a great deal of large specialized equipment.  The Navys COLDS forms the primary structures spanning the distance from the sealift ship to the shore.  Landing craft and warping tugs are also used to assemble causeways and move other equipment.  Other support craft include the Lighter Amphibious Resupply Cargo (LARC) Boat, Inflatable Boat and MPF Utility Boats.  Prior to assembly, unloading the causeway systems requires heavy lift capability often delivered by Navy amphibious construction battalions.
Award will be made in the form of an Indefinite Delivery requirement contract to one technically acceptable responsible offeror.
 A firm fixed-price type contract is anticipated for this effort with a five year ordering period, commencing on 01 Oct, 2013.  

The government is aware of only one source that has historically been able to satisfy the requirements of the CIMOTS/COLDS program; at present, services are being provided by Defense Support Services LLC., under contract N61339-08-C-0045. This sources sought synopsis is the Governments effort to ascertain if any other offeror is able to meet the needs of the Government for these requirements. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.
  

Interested sources shall (1) provide evidence of the offerors capabilities to perform all elements contained in the COLDS Major Capabilities statement; (2) provide a plan demonstrating ability to staff the requirement with fully qualified and certified personnel; (3) present evidence of satisfactorily conducting instructional, maintenance, operational, and training support services in a military classroom and at sea training environment within the past three year period (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact; and (4) discuss overall management experience/approach of similar programs. 

Answers with capabilities must be submitted by email to Mr. Byron Perez (Byron.E.Perez@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2007, no later than 4:00 pm EST, (MMDDYYYY).
 Alternative submittal method by mail to: NAWCTSD, Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN: Code 25362 (Byron E. Perez), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, Fl. 32826-3275. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The submission of this information is for PLANING PURPOSES ONLY. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations, request for bids or proposals, but, as stated above, is displaying the Governments intent to make certain that no other offeror is capable of meeting these requirements; as such, this sources sought notice is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.
 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, Byron E. Perez, via e-mail at Byron.E.Perez@navy.mil or by telephone at 407-380-4491.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia, PA office is seeking information for potential sources of expertise in the logistics support services necessary to assist Naval Weapons System Support (NAVWSS) in ensuring that the new ERP systems are effectively implemented, corrected defects are validated, and failed IDOCS (intermediate documents) are maintained at an acceptable level. 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the required products and/or services and plan to hire and maintain sufficient qualified staff. Additionally, this Sources Sought notice is being published with the intent to promote competition.
 Suggestions from industry regarding how competition may best be achieved are requested. All such suggestions will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its own choosing in accordance with the applicable procurement regulations. The anticipated place of performance is as follows:

Place of Performance:
Naval Supply Systems Command  Weapons Systems Support
700 Robbins Avenue  Building 1
Philadelphia, PA 19111

5450 Carlisle Pike  Building 311
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055

Anticipated Period of Performance:  28 March 2013  27 September 2013 and two 6-month options.

DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL
DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND
The NAVSUP WSS has recently implemented a new and complex Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) throughout its organization. This new system has completely changed the framework of the Navys information technology system. The system is designed to incorporate the latest commercial technology into the way the Navy conducts its supply and financial operations.
 The end result will be a streamlined system that is less costly to run and more efficient in the management of the NAVYs inventory assets. Due to the complexity of the Navy logistics operations, the Navy ERP Program has evolved into a very unique system with little or no comparison to the private sector.

As with any new system of this magnitude there are several problems that need to be addressed. Principal among these problems are the many documents that fail to successfully process through the new system. These documents fail for a variety of reasons and must be corrected and successfully processed back into the system. This is a critical step in the process and if not properly completed the entire system will be rendered ineffective.
 The failed documents were an expected outcome of the introduction of this new system and a process to analyze causes of these failures and to identify solutions was implemented. In the interim, the failed documents needed correction.

Services associated with this requirement are currently being procured via task order N00189-12-F-Z439 under contract GS-23F-0076K with GENERAL DYNAMICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY and previously through task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 with the same. The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price.

The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking. It is requested that, in its response to the Sources Sought, a vendor identify whether it has the capability to perform under all of the tasking or only specific portions of it.
 Also, if the vendor has any questions about the structure of the statement of work, please also identify those in the response.

ELIGIBILITY
The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 and the size standard is $14M. The Product Service Code (PSC) is R706.

SUBMISSION DETAILS
Interested businesses should submit a brief capabilities statement package of no more than ten 8.5" x 11" pages (font no smaller than 10 point) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in this Technical Description. All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size and Points-of-Contact information including name, phone number, fax number and e-mail address.

Responses to this Sources Sought shall be submitted electronically by email to Charles Hoyes, Contract Specialist, at charles.hoyes@navy.mil.
 Responses shall be received no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 26 Oct 2012.
Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Please submit all questions to the Contract Specialist via email or alternatively at 717-605-2024. No phone or email solicitations regarding the status of the request for proposal will be accepted prior to its release.

PTSD Service Dog Study - Wellness and Veterinary Health Care Plans

***THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NO PRICING IS REQUIRED. THE VA IS ONLY SEEKING SOURCES AND INFORMATION. CONTRACTORS ARE WELCOME TO PROVIDE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE SOLICIATIONS.***

BACKGROUND

On October 28, 2009, President Obama signed the FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (H.R. 2647) into law, which became Public Law No: 111-84.  The law contains provisions for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to commence a three-year study to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder.  As a result, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to partner with a contractor that can provide dog wellness and veterinary health plans for service dogs that are enrolled in the Research Study mandated by Public Law No: 111-84. The Public Law states that 200 dogs (at maximum) will be enrolled into this research study. At this time, 17 pairings have already occurred.

One or more dog vendors under contract to VA will provide trained service dogs. VA anticipates that the trained dogs will be 18-24 months of age when ready to be paired with a Veteran in the study.  Just before pairing, VA will enroll the dog in a wellness plan and a veterinary medical plan, for at a period of at least 2 years.  At this time, the breed(s) that might be trained are not known, but larger breeds of dogs typically chosen for service dog training will likely be utilized.  Dogs will be certified clear for both hip and elbow dysplasia by the Orthopedic Foundation of America (OFA), and screened for eye disease and any genetic diseases recommended for that breed by OFA.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SUGGESTIONS FROM VENDORS

VA requests comments and suggestions on the plan specifications below as to how VA can best protect the health of service dogs on the research study at a reasonable cost.  VA also requests descriptions of representative plans that might meet VA's needs to provide wellness and veterinary health plans for service dogs, consistent with the specifications provided below. 

[Note: this request for information is unrelated to other VA solicitations targeted for service dogs that VA supports as a medical benefit; this solicitation applies only to service dogs that will be in the research study described above.]  

MINIMUM CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS

VA seeks contractors that can provide wellness plans, comprehensive veterinary health plans, or both.  Contractor must:

"	Demonstrate experience in administering either plan type. 
"	Provide coverage in the state of Florida.  VA is also interested in contractors capable of providing nationwide coverage.
"	Agree to be set up as a VA vendor ("vendorized") so that Direct Deposit payments for invoices can readily be made using the centralized VA vendor payment system.  
"	Provide centralized invoicing for plans such that VA can reimburse a single vendor account for all plans.

Contractor must also:

"	Be able to initiate coverage within 2 business days after being contacted by VA.
"	Agree to recognize VA as the owner of the plans, and provide VA timely information related to the status of plans, status of payments, and utilization of plans by veterans.
"	Agree to allow VA complete access to any veterinary medical records supported by the plan (to the extent that such access is within the contractor's corporate purview to provide).
"	Provide a copy of the plan benefits to the Veteran and VA research team which outlines the policy details in lay terms.  
"	Provide to the Veterans a wallet-size plan identification card with a toll free hotline number in case they have questions or need assistance.  

DESIRABLE FEATURES OF WELLNESS AND VETERINARY HEALTH PLANS

Desirable features of plans include:

"	Flexibility in providing plans by the month or by the year (both plans).
"	Options to cancel a plan without penalty and with refund of policy payments for any remaining months or fractional months (both plans). 
"	A dedicated account representative as a contact to answer questions about billing and payment issues (both plans).
"	Strategies that minimize or eliminate out-of-pocket expenses to Veterans obtaining services as part of the plan (both plans).
"	Strategies that minimize or eliminate the need for Veterans to provide payment at the time plan services are provided (both plans).  
"	Plans that cover pre-existing medical conditions in dogs that do not affect the dog's ability to perform the trained tasks for the Veteran (both plans).
"	Incentives to encourage Veterans to complete wellness plan visits on schedule (wellness plan only).

OBJECTIVES OF WELLNESS PLANS

The objectives of the wellness plan will be to maintain a healthy service dog, prolong the working life of the dog, diagnose and treat medical problems or parasitism as soon as possible, and diagnose and treat any potentially zoonotic diseases to protect the health and well-being of Veterans and their families.

1.  Required Components of Wellness Plans

a.  Vaccinations as recommended by the AVMA and any vaccinations appropriate for local endemic diseases.

b.  At least semi-annually:

(1) Weight, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, heart auscultation.
(2) Fecal analysis for presence of intestinal parasites, including Giardia spp.
(3) Urinalysis via catch, including gross specifications (color/turbidity), specific gravity, sediment exam (presence/absence of white or red blood cells, crystals, casts, bacteria), chemical strip analysis (protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood, nitrites), and bacterial culture and sensitivity if indicated 
(4) Otoscopic examination with swab/culture as indicated.
(5) Ophthalmic examination, slit lamp preferred, with ocular pressure check if indicated..
(6) Complete blood count/differential, including  hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count and morphology, white blood cell count, WBC differential, and platelets.
(7) Serum chemistries- blood glucose, BUN, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (SGPT), cholesterol, sodium, potassium
(8) Dental examination with tartar removal, if indicated.
(9) Neurological exam, including tests for limb pain and paresis, and gait analysis.
(10) Coat and skin examination, palpation for any tumors/swollen areas.
(11) Rectal examination, including anal gland expression as needed.
(12)  Abdominal palpation

c. At least annually:

(1) Electrocardiogram
(2) Heartworm/Lyme/Ehrlichia antibody testing, and Rocky Mountain tick fever testing if appropriate to locale.
(3) Chest radiograph, >1 view if indicated.

OBJECTIVES OF VETERINARY HEALTH PLAN

The primary objective of the veterinary health plan is to defray the cost of diagnosis and treatment of medical problems as much as possible.  This includes surgical and other required diagnostic interventions.  

1.  Required components of a veterinary health plan

a. Access to and coverage of emergency clinic visits.

b. Coverage for any breed/mixed breed dog utilized by VA as a service dog.

c. Diagnosis and treatment for neoplastic, endocrine, musculoskeletal, and neurologic conditions that could affect the ability of the service dog to perform the needed tasks or could limit the working life of the dog.

2. A very desirable component of a veterinary health plan would be no or limited restrictions on pre-existing conditions.  [Note: VA would be interested in risk-based rate reductions based upon sharing the results of an initial wellness examination prior to pairing a service dog with a Veteran.] 


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 

The performance period would be one base year plus four one-year options.  The performance base period would not exceed 12 months from date of award of contract. 

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

PROPOSED TASKS - (WILL BE MORE DEFINED UPON THE RELEASE OF A SOLICITATION/ REQUEST FOR QUOTES/REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.)

Task 1- Provide copies of policies to the Veteran and VA Contract COR, and a wallet card with contact information and plan ID to the Veteran.

 	Task 2 - Provide quarterly updates on plan utilization by each Veteran (Veteran/Dog Pairing Policy information)

Task 3 - Provide quarterly updates on all plans in place, including start and expiration dates, and payment status.

<DESC><strong>Initial Communication for Industry Regarding AFMC Enterprise Services Initiative<br /></strong>Solicitation Number: AFMC_Enterprise_Services
<p>As part of a strategic effort to increase efficiency in our acquisition processes, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) senior leadership has approved an initiative to streamline the acquisition of engineering and professional services across the Command. The AFMC Enterprise Services site is established to provide a single point for communications and to facilitate industry participation - this site will remain available thru FY14. The result of the initiative will be to standardize the approach for acquiring these services across AFMC and implement multiple award contract programs that aggregate requirements aligning to AFMC's 5 major mission areas of Life Cycle Management, Test, Sustainment, Science and Technology, and Nuclear. Standardization will be employed in the areas of small business treatment, contract type, contract term and simplified and uniform source selection process, both at the basic contract level as well as at the task order level. The intention is to utilize small business firms as prime contractors or members of joint ventures. The goal of this initiative is to increase efficiency by reducing administrative burden through fewer, standardized strategic contracts.</p>
<p>This FBO site will be the easiest entry point for industry to follow the acquisitions for these services. The initial strategic effort will be for the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) enterprise program, called Test Mission Advisory Services (TMAS). Information on the TMAS acquisition can be found at:</p>
<p>https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=81794ccddf41e66f11a34f992ccd318c&amp;ta=core&amp;_cview=1</p>
<p>The second enterprise services effort will be for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), to be followed by an enterprise program for the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). More information related to these two acquisition efforts will be posted as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Frequently Asked Q&amp;As, Initial Acquisition Schedules, and other announcements will all be announced through this site. This site will be updated as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>Industry is encouraged to register on the site under the "Watch This Opportunity" tab to ensure receiving an e-mail notice whenever an update is posted. Questions may be directed to the AFMC_Enterprise_Services e-mail box: Strat.Sourcing.Suppt@WPAFB.AF.MIL and the Q&amp;A answers will be posted periodically at this site.</p>

<DESC>You are invited to learn about the new conformal ablative thermal protection materials under development at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. DESCRIPTION The Conformal Ablator TPS (CA250) Project Element funded through the NASA Game Changing Division of the Space Technology Programs Office and precursor programs have supported the development of new, conformal high strain-to-failure thermal protection materials at NASA Ames Research Center.  There are several classes of these materials: flexible, silica-based, RF transparent materials capable of withstanding heat fluxes up to 115 W/cm2 and formable carbon-based materials with demonstrated capability up to 540 W/cm2. Due to the nature of these materials, they should be easier to apply to spacecraft than current thermal protection systems (TPS).  Further, they should be manufacturable in large (~1-m2 or larger) pieces and bonded directly to an aeroshell with no need for uncoupled gap fillers.	The silica-based materials may be reusable if exposed to low heating environments or refurbished by spraying silicone on the surface post-flight. Based on Shuttle experience, it is believed that the life cycle cost of these new materials will be roughly 1/10 that of tiled TPS solutions.  EVENT DATE AND LOCATION Friday, November 2, 2012 at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California and via WebEx TIMES Presentation: 8:30-11:30am PDT One-on-one appointments  available: 1:00pm, 2:00pm, 3:00pm, and 4:00pm ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/REGISTRATION Please register for all attendees from your company, even if attending via WebEx and sign up for one-on-one (vendor-to-NASA) appointments, if attending in person and desired. Seating space is limited and NASA Ames reserves the right to limit the number of attendees. WHO SHOULD ATTEND? Commercial Orbital Space Transportation Services contractors and other spacecraft and mission designers.  Potential material suppliers are welcome as well. Visitors are required to be U.S. citizens.	ITAR information may be presented. POINT OF CONTACT For more information and to register, contact Robin Beck at 650-604-2581 or robin.a.beck@nasa.gov. R.S.V.P. by October 26, 2012.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY/PRE PROPOSAL NOTICE FOR GLEN CANYON POWER PLANT GENERATORS G1, G3, G5, AND G6 REWINDS (ROEBEL DESIGN REBUILDS)
You are invited to attend an Industry Day on October 24, 2012 to be focused on the Bureau of Reclamation's requirement for "Glen Canyon Power plant Generators G1, G3, G5, and G6 Rewinds (Roebel Design Rebuilds)."  This event is being hosted by the Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, at the Glen Canyon Dam Power plant in Page, AZ.   
Note that a separate Industry Day will be conducted for another Bureau of Reclamation requirement entitled "GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements" (Reference number R12PS40038) on October 23, 2012.  Search Fedbizopps to find the Industry Day notice for the "GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements" (Reference number R12PS40038). 
PURPOSE:   To determine project interest and industry capabilities.  This will be a forum for prospective offerors to hear the details of the project by the Glen Canyon Power plant team, both in the form of a presentation and a site visit, and to facilitate a question-and-answer session.   Information gained may be incorporated into the future solicitation or used as a basis for additional research into alternative methods of executing this project.  Participants will be given ample opportunities to talk directly with the Glen Canyon Power plant team during and after the Industry Day.
TARGET AUDIENCE:  Interested and potential offerors including prime contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and contractors interested in teaming or joint venture arrangements.  All should be aware that two separate Industry Days are being conducted back-to-back for two separate projects (Generator Rebuilds and GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements) at the same location.  This was done recognizing that potential offerors and interested vendors may have an interest in both projects and therefore could attend on both days without expending time and incurring costs for two separate visits.  It is also believed that it would increase vendor interest and attendance for both projects.  You may request a copy of the draft plans and specifications by following the instructions below under "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION."
WHEN:  Wednesday, October 24, 2012
WHERE:  Carl V. Hayden Visitor's Center Auditorium, Glen Canyon Dam, Page, Arizona
TIME:  0900 - 1600 Arizona Standard Time
REGISTRATION:  Please register for this event by close of business October 19, 2012 by sending an email to kmunro@usbr.gov, Subject:  "Industry Day-R12PS40054-Generator Rebuilds" and include your company name, attendee's names, phone number, email address, and your firm's contractors, manufactures, suppliers size and type of business (e.g. large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc) and bonding capabilities per contract in the body of your email.
SYNOPSIS:  The principal components of the work will involve the following major tasks: 1.  Remove and dispose of existing stator core and armature winding for generators, 2.  Factory test, install and field test new stator core for generators. 3.  Factory test, install and field test new armature windings for generators. 4.  Install and field test new armature windings for 4 generators. 5.  Furnish spare parts for generator armature winding. 6.  Remove, refurbish, re-install and test field poles for generators.
INQUIRIES: Prospective offerors should submit technical questions concerning this Bureau of Reclamation requirement to be addressed at Industry Day, via email to kmunro@usbr.gov, Subject:  "Question(s)-R12PS40054-Generator Rebuilds-(insert company name making the inquiry)."  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, anticipates issuing a competitive solicitation for this requirement approximately late January 2013.  Whether or not it will be full-and-open competition or subject to some type of set-aside is yet to be determined, depending on the results of this Industry Day and other pending market research.   In accordance with FAR 36.204, the disclosed magnitude of this construction project is over $10 million.   Draft plans and specifications for this project will be made available upon request via email to mhnelson@usbr.gov, Subject:  "Request for Draft Plans/Specifications-R12PS40054-Generator Rebuilds-(insert company name making the inquiry)."  The plans and specifications will be made available via e-mail since the files are small enough for most e-mail servers.
All prospective offerors shall be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registry via www.sam.gov and ensure completed and active Offeror Representations and Certifications for their company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335312 - Armature rewinding on a factory basis, size standard 1,000 employees. 
This Special Notice is being issued to help the Bureau of Reclamation determine the availability and interest of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this Special Notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this Special Notice.  This FedBizOps Special Notice is strictly for market research.   As a result of this Special Notice, the Government may issue a competitive solicitation; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the Special Notice (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Willamette National Forest, has awarded a sole source contract for the Springfield Interagency Office - Office Furniture and Reconfiguration through GSA contractor Herman Miller, Inc., c/o Office World Inc. (dealer). This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy the agency requirements, and pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(j) as implemented by FAR 6.305, availability of the justification. The Springfield Interagency Office (SIO) tenants include the Forest Service, BLM, and three branches of the military in a building owned by Oregon Military Department (OMD). In addition to construction of the building in 2008-2009, OMD initiated the purchase of the existing modular furniture, which is consistent throughout the building for all tenants. There are three departments within the Forest Service that require an office reconfiguration and the purchase of some furniture. The Forest Service has an inventory of excess furniture; however, not enough to complete reconfiguring the office for this move. The office modular furniture to be purchased needs to match and be compatible with the existing furniture. The purchase order includes the purchase of some office furniture, design, and installation. Estimated delivery and installation is November 30, 2012. The award number assigned to this effort is AG-04R4-P-12-0082, dated September 28, 2012.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Notice for Speaker Participation&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISA Enterprise Service Management Framework Consortium<br /><br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION <br />The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), is seeking participation from commercial companies or integrators that wish to speak at the Department's ESMF Consortium event and have experience in implementing ITSM/ITIL best practices in their environment or can speak to industry trends and practices in Service Management with special emphasis on Service Transition. DISA is interested in having four - six (4-6) speakers from industry to present their experiences in industry (as opposed to government) with ITIL/ITSM adoption efforts.</p>
<p>1.1 OVERVIEW</p>
<p>This event is solely for the exchange of information and knowledge. The speakers in the event will benefit from government exchange with the Defense Department as a whole; however presentation at the event does not provide speakers with any competitive advantage or preferential treatment in future acquisitions related to or resulting from the event. Additionally, the government does not support or endorse any company that attends or presents during the event.</p>
<p>1.2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Consortium event is intended to facilitate a learning exchange and public dialogue between industry and the Department of Defense (DoD). <br />To build upon the success of the Consortium the following objectives will be met:<br />&bull; Bring together government and industry professionals to detail the work that's currently being done throughout the DoD regarding ESMF<br />&bull; Highlight industry ESMF implementation best practices and lessons learned <br />&bull; Establish a Community of Practice</p>
<p>The two-day event will consist of industry and government speakers discussing existing DoD problems within the Service Transition domain (e.g., Change Management, Configuration Management, Asset Management,</p>
<p>Service Validation and Testing, Knowledge Management, and Release and Deployment Management)</p>
<p>The Consortium is held biannually at Fort Meade, MD on the DISA campus and will also be available via Defense Connect Online and video teleconferencing.</p>
<p>Government attendees include but are not limited to DISA, each military department, each combatant command, and military agencies. Participants for the most part will be GS-15 and O-6 level with some flag-level speakers and participants.</p>
<p>2. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>2.1 Speaker Experience (limit to two pages)</p>
<p>Speakers are asked to provide a submission that summarizes their experience with ITSM, ITIL, eTOM or other Business Process Management as applied to computing, IT, Telecommunications and Cloud Computing. Experiences should be outside the government realm and should demonstrate use internally to their corporation or large client applications (specifically to organizations that sell or support IT/Telecom services to groups larger than 10,000 with support staff in the hundreds). The government is looking to share experiences with large-scale service providers.</p>
<p>2.2 Speaker Presentation (limit to 15 slides)</p>
<p>Potential speakers should be able to speak to the application of ITSM specifically in the Service Transition Domain (e.g., Change Management, Configuration Management, Asset Management, Service Validation and Testing, Knowledge Management, and Release and Deployment Management). Presentation submissions must respond to one of the following problem statements and clearly state which problem is being addressed:</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: Identify approaches or solutions industry uses for Knowledge Management that leverage and enable Service Validation and Testing.</p>
<p>PS2: What points in the testing process does industry require metadata registration, and what are the processes used for updating that metadata?<br />PS3: Define steps necessary to model agency cultural change towards Knowledge Management as the framework required to continue to develop and nurture a successful Knowledge Management program.<br />PS4: Detail how all DoD Knowledge Management activities can be interlinked to roll-out a standardized (Joint) enterprise Knowledge Management Program.<br />PS5: Determine how DISA could leverage other DoD Knowledge Management activities to help alleviate current resource constraints (e.g. Knowledge Management training, rotations, etc).<br />SERVICE VALIDATION AND TESTING<br />PS1: Where in the test process does industry traditionally assess quality and what is industry perspective on importance of the quality assessment?<br />PS2: In advance of testing in an environment, to what extent does industry typically define services (e.g. transport, cross domain, run time), test tools and reporting platforms for types of testing described in the program Test Strategy? <br />PS3: What lessons learned in industry regarding core capabilities and metrics must be considered in the test environment (versus operations)?<br />PS4: What standard practices does industry employ for capacity and scalability testing within your test environment? <br />PS5: What core test measures, results and criteria does industry use to assess your systems during the Service Test and Validation phase?<br />PS6: To what extent do operations access your service and validation testing architecture to verify and validate their ability to run and sustain the capabilities prior to deployment? <br />PS7: What core monitoring capabilities does industry build into the infrastructure to collect information on the status of the service and its performance?<br />RELEASE &amp; DEPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: What are industry experience using business intelligence tools for decisional dash boarding, test results, configuration audits and operational reporting? <br />CHANGE MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: Currently DISA faces multiple challenges with the integration of the ESM Service Transition functions of Change Management, Configuration Management and Knowledge Management. What are some basic industry best practices to accelerate the capability and maturity of these service management functions into a mature Service Management System?</p>
<p>PS2: Define steps necessary to model and encourage industry cultural change towards Change Management as the framework required to develop and nurture a successful Change Management program.<br />PS3: What measures has industry instituted to implement complete transparency and visibility between all groups for all Change Management processes. Currently, visibility does not exist between DISA's stakeholders and senior management; transparency is required throughout the entire Change Management process.</p>
<p>PS4: Detail industry's efforts to develop and implement a centralized agency-wide tool that will standardize multiple disparate change processes, such as databases, spreadsheets, SharePoint and PowerPoint, and integrate them into a single tool, utility and/or dashboard.</p>
<p>PS5: Define the steps necessary to model industry change submittal and implementation towards the continued development of successful Change Management processes, including procedures, processes, terminology and change criteria, such as risk, priority and impact.</p>
<p>PS6: Detail industry efforts to develop the methods and matrices required to mitigate, reduce and/or prevent downtime or cost over-runs in the deployment, embedment and stand-up of changes within a Change Management environment in your organization.</p>
<p>PS7: Discuss industry efforts to ensure understanding of unintended effects of change, and how you evaluate the risk factors when considering the effects of a service change.</p>
<p>SERVICE ASSET AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>PS1: Detail how industry deals with ever changing naming standards for hardware and software products in your asset inventory files.</p>
<p>PS2: Detail industry efforts on how to adopt a risk-based testing approach aimed at reducing risk to the service and the customer's business and integrating testing into the project and service life-cycle.</p>
<p>PS3: Detail industry efforts on how to keep the Configuration Management Database up-to-date and accurate. Discuss automatic update of the CMDB using discovery tools vs. reconciling the discrepancies when the data discovered doesn't match what is in the authorized CMDB.</p>
<p>PS4: Discuss industry activities associated with monitoring process performance. What key performance indicators and metrics should be developed and implemented?</p>
<p>PS5: In light of the convergence of different applications amid the Service Transition, does the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF) also take into consideration an overarching and uniform Data Governance for the data within these systems?</p>
<p>PS6: Contrast the current users Configuration Management constructs against current industry change management concepts in order to assess meeting the customer's needs while inhibiting cost growth.</p>
<p>SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>PS1: As a federal government/DoD agency, DISA is required to follow federal statutes and regulations regarding supplier/contractor relationships. What are some practical approaches to implement a Supplier Chain Risk Management capability to appropriately manage supplier risk?</p>
<p>GENERAL<br />What special considerations affect Service Transition processes in the Joint Information Environment/JIE Technology Synchronization Office (JIE/JTSO) context, where multiple loosely federated sizable enterprises (combatant commands/military services/agencies in this case) with many critical global missions already in progress need to collaborate, coordinate and synchronize on some/most/all of the Service Transition activities? How will/should those special considerations for Service Transition affect Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Operations, and Continual Service Improvement? Are there differences in the near-term and long-term implications? How should we prepare for these impacts?</p>
<p>2.3 Submission</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO UNDERTAKE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT ACTION TO ADD ADDITIONAL SERVICE COVERAGE TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT

Network Contracting Office 8 intends to undertake a sole source contract action for the procurement of periodic maintenance and repair services for its EVOTECH sterilization equipment at its West Palm Beach VA Medical Center. The following system requires coverage.

Description							Quantity
EVOTECH Endoscope Cleaner & Reprocessor 208V	     	     5
These services will be procured from Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP), a Division of Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, located at 33 Technology Drive, Irvine, CA, 92618-2346. The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 81129 (Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance), with a size standard of $19 million.

The Government intends to issue a modification to contract VA248-12-C-0202 for this requirement on a Sole Source Basis, per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), wherein "the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source." Servicing the systems requires both adequate training and the ability to provide replacement parts.  ASP will not sell parts for the EVOTECH systems to anyone who has not undertaken their official training course in Irvine, CA.  Moreover, their technicians are legally bound by a non-compete agreement which prohibits them from servicing the EVOTECH systems independently of ASP.  Because of these two factors, besides ASP, there are no known providers of EVOTECH system maintenance service.  

All responsible sources which assert that they can provide these services may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Interested respondents must submit a capability statement within 3 business days after the publication of this notice. Submission of a capability statement shall be made via email, to Eric Sullivan, Contracting Officer, at eric.sullivan2@va.gov. Subject of email should reference VA248-12-C-0202. 

All responses received will be evaluated. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Costs associated with the preparation and submission of information and any follow-up information requests are the responsibility of the offeror, and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>BACKGROUND
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP), Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Tallahassee, located in Tallahassee, Florida, intends to award a firm, fixed, price requirements type contract to a qualified entity for the provision of professional, temporary services in the form of a Temporary Pharmacist. The services will be contracted witha Private Sector Temporary Help Services Provider and not with an individual. The Temporary Pharmacist will provide services for the inmates incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution and Federal Detention Center.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The medical services will be performed in the Health Services Department at the Federal Correctional Institution and Federal Detention Center, Tallahassee, Florida. The contractor will be required to sign the contractor log indicating the date of visit to the institution along with the time of arrival and departure for security reasons.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Contract performance shall commence from the first day of assignment up to 120 workdays in a 24-month period. A workday will consist at least one (1) session and not exceed eight (8) sessions. The total duration of services will be consistent with the needs of the government, the availability of funds, and contractor performance. The Government reserves the right to extend the purchase order an additional 120 workdays, if required.</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor will provide pharmacist services during the absence of the institution's pharmacist, i.e. during periods of annual leave, sick leave, and training, as well as reassignment. The contractor will normally work, Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays), normally between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes unpaid lunch period, (if applicable). A session will equal one (1) hour. Each contractor visit will normally consist of eight (8) sessions. The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will be responsible for defining the weekly schedule. These schedules are subject to change based on the variable needs of the institution and the unpredictable nature of the correctional environment. Upon agreement, any changes to the schedules must be coordinated with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) assigned under the contract. Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be experienced. Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one (1) session. Normally, any remaining sessions for that day will be suspended and the contractor will be free to leave and will not be paid for remaining unperformed sessions. However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions. In the event of any absence, the contractor shall provide replacement coverage. If the contractor fails to provide coverage, the Government may seek contractual remedy. At the beginning and end of each visit, the scheduled pharmacist will sign his/her name in a log book located in the FCI/FDCfront lobby/entrance. Payment for services will be based on actual scheduled sessions worked in accordance with the terms and pricing of the contract.</p>

POC: SFC DeLeon Kelly, (760) 380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

POC: SFC Zahnley,Jason 760-360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor's programs shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local requirements, specifically including Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962, et seq.) and implementing regulations (40 CFR part 247).
DIAP2010-14 Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (July 2010) a)  FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation.  One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 
(b)  The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS.  CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report.  Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
(c)  We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award.  Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official.  The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
(d)  When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions.  Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.
(e)  Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment.  Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22.  Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions.  If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form.  Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government.  If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date).  The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment."  Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.
(f)  The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
        	(1)  Protect the evaluation as "source selection information."  After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS.  If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions.  
	(2)  Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization.  Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.
	(3)  Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
	(g)  If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation.  The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.
    	(h)  A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.
DOI LOCAL CLAUSE IPP - Electronic Invoice and Payment Requirements - Internet Payment Platform Payment requests must be submitted electronically through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).

<p>VOLUME 2 - PRICE PROPOSAL:</p>
<p>This is a Firm Fixed Price contract. All labor categories will be billed as fixed hourly rates. Any other direct costs will be considered as cost-reimbursable items.</p>
<p>For the purposes of proposing, the Government estimates the level of effort required for<br />fulfilling the contract as follows:</p>
<p>Base Period - 570 estimated hours</p>
<p>Offerors shall use their independent judgment in determining the labor mix and SHALL USE the level of effort identified above to price the requirements identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>Each Offeror shall submit a price proposal separate from the technical proposal.</p>
<p>The price proposal shall include the following:</p>
<p>a) Completed signed copy of the proposal. The Offeror shall indicate the price to be charged for each item in Section B rounded to the nearest whole dollar. <br />b) Completed below Tables, Table 1 and Table 2, and Section B Summary Spreadsheet (Attachment 3) in Microsoft Excel format or compatible.<br />c) Fixed hourly rates shall be fully burdened and include all costs (direct and indirect), overhead, and profit. <br />d) Offerors are strongly encouraged to offer discounts off their published rates. Identify by percentage any discounts or price reductions offered. <br />e) Proposed other direct costs (ODCs) for travel in support of this contract shall not exceed $20,000. Accordingly, each Offeror shall propose a minimum ODC-Travel amount of $20,000. The Offeror shall complete the attached Travel Breakout spreadsheet (Attachment 4) in the event out-of-state travel is needed to meet the SOW requirements. <br />f) If applicable, Subcontractor and/or Teaming Partner Supporting Documentation. Both teaming and subcontracting are permissible under this RFP. If a teaming arrangement is proposed, each teaming partner shall provide a copy of their respective proposals to the prime contractor. If subcontracting is proposed, the prime contractor shall disclose to the Government's Contracting Officer (CO) a copy of the subcontract pricing, terms and conditions, or teaming agreement. The Government will evaluate the acceptability of any subcontracting or teaming arrangement as part of its evaluation of price. Failure to provide complete supporting documentation may result in no further consideration of the Offeror's proposal. Subcontractors may submit proprietary data directly to the Contracting Officer or through the prime contractor in a separate e-mail correspondence.<br />g) Offerors shall submit on-site and off-site hourly rates in the format identified in the below table.<br />Table 1 - Line Item Table</p>
<p>Number of Hours Hourly Rate<br />Period of Performance: Date of Award - 3/31/2013 <br />Position On-site Off-site On-Site Off-site<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999). The Government intends to award based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>A single award will be made to the responsible Offeror submitting an overall proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal meets the Government's requirements and whose technical proposal and price represent the best value to the Government. The Government also reserves the right to make no award pursuant to this solicitation. The evaluation of proposals will be based on the following factors:</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach and Understanding<br />B. Management Approach and Capabilities <br />C. Past Performance<br />D. Price (Non-Rated)</p>
<p>Technical Approach and Understanding is more important than Management Approach and Capabilities, which is more important than Past Performance. When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (A) Technical Approach and Understanding, (B) Management Approach and Capabilities, and (C) Past Performance are significantly more important than price. As the technical proposals become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced proposals. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced proposal if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p><br />EVALUATION OF FACTORS</p>
<p>Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Technical proposal submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>1) Technical Approach and Understanding - the degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates a knowledge, understanding, and technical ability to successfully perform the requirements of the SOW. Additionally, the appropriateness, soundness and reasonableness of the Offeror's problem resolution approach will be assessed.</p>
<p>2) Management Approach and Capabilities - the demonstrated effectiveness of the Offerors general management approach to providing personnel and all requirements of the SOW; and the adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed Project Management Plan.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - will assess the relevance, breadth and quality of the Offeror's recent past performance on similar type of work. The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror's past performance based on the past performance references provided in the Offeror's submission and/or other information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this procurement. An Offeror without a record of past performance or for whom information on relevant past performance is not available will be evaluated as neutral.</p>
<p>Price Proposal</p>
<p>The Offeror's proposed pricing will be evaluated against the Government's estimated level of effort. The Government expects to receive price competition through the submission of several price proposals. Offeror's shall propose fixed unit prices that are both realistic and reasonable.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this internet address: https://www.acquisition.gov/far; 52.204-4 Printed Copied Double-Sided on Recycled paper (AUG 2000); 52.246-15 Certificate of Conformance (APR 1984); 52.247-34 FOB Destination; <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>The proposal price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the offeror has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs. They assist in developing response strategies, in managing all aspects of grants for humanitarian donor organizations, and in preparing talking points, information products, and briefing material. They manage portfolios consisting of one or several countries, and are members of regionally focused humanitarian response teams consisting of other DOSs, a Team Leader, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists.</p>
<p>DOSs are part of the Disaster Response Team within DRM. This team consists of six regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), South Asia (SA), East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA). Each regional group is managed by a Team Leader.</p>
<p>With this solicitation, OFDA intends to hire DOSs for its Africa regional groups. After an initial time with the Africa regional groups, there may also be opportunities to work with other regional groups within OFDA.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Questions 10/11/2012:
<p>1) I have one final annoying question on your solicitation. Considering the drawings are 'build to order by specification', any changes we make need to be documented. Are you expecting new drawings or simply additions to Attachment C? I'm just trying to make certain I cover my drafting department if needed.<br />-- we are expecting drawings that will be your proposed implementation of the spec. They need to clearly demonstrate that you are satisfying all requirements whether you create new drawings or you red-line or markup the other drawings with the appropriate changes. Technical evaluation will be done based on the input you provide.</p>
<p>Answer: The drawings given provide specifications and requirements but do not dictate how the cables are to be constructed. That is up to the vendor to design, copy someone else's design, etc. ....</p>
<p>u. Proposals shall be accompanied by vendor production level drawings to demonstrate compliance to all specifications and requirements.</p>

(b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply: 
(1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation.

If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections.

(2) Tradeoffs are not permitted.

POC: SFC Zahnley,Jason 760-360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF. Contractors must register to use WAWF at this website and ensure an electronic business point of contact (POC) is designated in the System for Award Management (SAM) site at http://www.sam.gov within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract.

POC: SFC Jason Zahnley @ 760-380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>This project involves the renovation of this empty inpatient ward to accommodate these traumatically wounded and injured service members from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Due to the complex nature
of their injuries, this ward requires several areas to undergo renovation. Additionally, there is an opportunity to
conduct inpatient rehabilitation care on this same ward, saving transfer of these patients to network facilities and supporting continuity in their rehabilitation management. The current ward will require several modifications to make this a model environment for delivering care.

<ARCHDATE>10222012
<DESC><br /> U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission<br />Division of Contracts<br />Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>1.	The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a                   non-competitive firm fixed price type contract with Advanced Nuclear Technology International, Analysv&auml;gen 5, SE-435 33 M&ouml;lnlycke, Sweden.</p>
<p>2.	The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), supplies or services may be considered to be available from only one source when a source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that (1) demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see definition at 2.1010); (2) offers a services not otherwise available to the Government; and (3) does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>3.	In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.603(c), the unsolicited proposal for consolidate/compile information/reports relating to LWR Chemistry and Component Integrity, LCC*-10 Programmes, and related information  meets the stated requirements: (1) innovative and unique; independently developed by offeror; (3) prepared without Government supervision; (4) benefit to the Government, (5) not an advance proposal to a known agency requirement; and (6) does not address a previously published agency requirement.  The service that A.N.T International provides services that meet the agency's need to and augments the current research performed by RES/DE/CMB and RES/DE/CIB organizations.  The Contractor provides expertise on light water reactor materials corrosion and structural integrity.  To accomplish the above stated objectives for this project, the contractor must have:   (1) detailed knowledge of world-wide PWR and BWR nuclear power plants; (2) demonstrated experience and expertise in systems, structures, and components (SSC) important to safety; and (3) an assembly of international experts with unique materials expertise involving both plant experience and laboratory experience with demonstrated knowledge of irradiation behavior an plant chemistry. The period of performance for this contract is 1 base year and 2 optional years at a total cost of $75,000.00.</p>
<p>4.	 In accordance with FAR 2.101, the unsolicited proposal is unique because A.N.T International offers a comprehensive international survey of the results of worldwide research and publication of information from international scientific meetings and A.N.T. International is the only contractor that offers  compiles and consolidates information relating to the contractor's LWR Chemistry and Component integrity, LCC8-10 Programmes, chemical corrosion issues, and current emerging issues and recent progress relating to Structural Materials Degradation.   While other potential source may offer parts of information A.N.T. provides comprehensive and consolidate information/reports.</p>
<p>The main source of information will be the review of more than 150 papers presented at the International Conference on Environmental Degradation of Materials in Nuclear Power Systems - Water Reactors, and Additional information published in scientific journals. The Contractor will provide it's LCC8-10 Programme on plant chemistry, and LCC8 Reports on Plant Chemistry.  The CC8 Report will include three separate Reports on: (1) BWR Chemistry Volume II; (2) PWR/VVER Primary Side Coolant Chemistry Volume II; and (3) Annual Report on Key Emerging Issues and Recent Progress relating to Plant Chemistry/Corrosion - Review of the most recent information.  For the LCC9-10 Reports on Plant Chemistry. the following Reports will be prepared: (1) Annual Report on Key Emerging Issues and Recent Progress relating to Plant Chemistry/Corrosion ;   (2)  Review of key information published during the last 12 months (LCC9 and 10); (3) Annual Report on Operational Issues and Practices (LCC9 and 10); and (4) Effect of Coolant chemistry on fuel performance (LCC9). Furthermore the  research services provide an unique approach of gathering international high quality experts, and cumulative scientific knowledge presented in international forums</p>
<p>5.	 The cost for this unsolicited proposal is fair and reasonable when compared to similar services and reports.  In addition, since this work is cost-shared by many international organizations, the overall cost is much less than what it could be if it was not cost-shared by multiple organizations. In accordance with FAR 6.303-2(b)(6) this requirement will be posted in the Federal Opportunity Business fourteen (14) days after award.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price to the Government for these services is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>6.	The NRC conducted internet-based market research of potential organizations, who could provide similar or same services as proposed by ANT International.  Such organizations, with expertise in the field of nuclear reactor materials conducting the scope of the work proposed, may involve DOE laboratories, CNWRA (Southwest Research Institute, EPRI, KAPL (Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory), within the U.S., and other similar international organizations, such as JAERI (Japan), KAERI (Korea), and French laboratory, CEA Cadarache (France).  The results of the market research was that while there was isolated and scattered research in the subject areas mentioned in the unsolicited proposal, the NRC did not find a comprehensive international survey of the results of worldwide research and publication of information from international scientific meetings, as has been proposed in the ANT International's unsolicited proposal.</p>
<p>7.	In order to address the issue of removing any possible barrier to future competition, the government intends to conduct market research which include issuing a source sought notice prior to award another contract for this type of research services.</p>
