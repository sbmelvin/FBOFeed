<CONTACT>J. Paul Hardin, Contracting Officer, 210-977-3493
<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don’t intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary.

<DESC>1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 2.  CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations.  3.  CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with options for production and software maintenance and support.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified.  4.  Attached you will find draft copies of the Statement of Objectives (SOO), the Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), and the Request for Proposal (RFP) (all sections) for the aforementioned acquisition.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, plans to award a sole source modification under the existing contract N00167-06-M-5542, in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The contract is for an extended surface surveillance system to be used by LANTFLT aircraft carriers. This modification is necessary due to a change in location of the system, which will require additional components and supporting equipment. These additional components must integrate with Torrey Pines Logic’s proprietary control software. The anticipated modification to the current contract will increase the ceiling by approximately $170,000.  There is no change in the period of performance. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to!   the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division has a requirement for four (4) GPS High Stability (GPS/HS) Rb Timing Modules (including 1 PPS, 10 Mpps, and IRIG-B outputs) with GPS Antenna Assembly with 50ft cable.  The modules will be used as the time base in the Shipboard Acoustic Receiver/Transmitter System (SARTS) in support of Navy submarine acoustic testing.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm fixed price purchase order to EndRun Technologies.  EndRun Technologies is the exclusive manufacturer of the GPS/HS Rb Timing Module, and these modules must be identical to those currently in the system being replicated to minimize system development and out-year ILS costs.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to res!  pond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 01 May 2007, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and "green" building systems.   EXECUTIVE ORDERS , LAWS, REGULATIONS  Executive Order (EO) 12770 - "Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs" - In accordance with EO 12770 and Public Law 100-418, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement. EO 13423 - "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management" - In accordance with EO 13423 and the Federal Register's "Energy Conservation Standards for New Federal Commercial and Multi-Family High-Rise Residential Buildings and New Federal Low-Rise Residential Buildings", as of January 03, 2007 and January 24, 2007 respectively, work under this contract will be subject to the applicable requirements of these regulations. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A)	Pre-Design Services:  "	Programming (Site Analysis, Site Program, and Architectural Program) "	Contextual Analysis "	Supplementary Services B)	Design Services: "	Schematic Design "	Value Analysis and Value-based decision making "	Design Development "	Construction Documents "	Construction Support C)	Compliance Services: "	Research "	Inventory, Resource Surveys, Wetland Delineations "	Historic Structure and Cultural Landscape Reports and Assessments "	NEPA Compliance "	106 and NHPA Compliance "	Other Environmental Compliance (i.e. fish habitat assessments, biological assessments, statement of findings for floodplains and wetlands, coastal zone management consistency determinations) D)	Cost Estimating, including Life Cycle Costing and Total Cost of Ownership E)	Permitting F)	Construction Management A documented internal Quality Control program shall be applied to all services performed.  Further information on National Park Service governing laws and policies, standards, definitions, practices and guidelines can be found at - http://workflow.den.nps.gov/staging/6_Design/design_bid_build.htm. COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State and local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	Demonstrated experience with integrated design, with an emphasis on coordinated multidisciplinary teams, establishment of up-front environmental and sustainable goals, whole systems approach and follow-through. Ability of the team to communicate, coordinate, and facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary design team, considering the primary geographic area of work. Emphasis will be placed on the team's prior work experience as a team on previous projects, and ability to work with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns. 2.	Demonstration of a sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources and the global environment, as well as aesthetic considerations appropriate for National Park settings. Demonstration of a preservation design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable treatment solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to character-defining features, historic fabric and historic scene, and adherence to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Demonstrated understanding of the four categories of ultimate historic structure treatments: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and Reconstruction. 3.	  Demonstrated ability, experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract in various climatic regions for the geographic area covered by this solicitation. Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. 4.	Demonstration of the quality and effectiveness of the firm's work and quality review and assurance procedures.  Include examples of Quality Control process records demonstrating effectiveness of firm's procedures. 5.	Demonstrated experience with Natural and Cultural Resource Compliance (i.e. NEPA, Section 106) and demonstrated experience with local and state permitting and regulatory requirements with consideration of public water systems, sewage disposal systems, State Fire Marshall reviews, contaminated sites, fuel oil storage and transfer, etc.  Demonstrated ability to integrate compliance and permitting into the construction process.. In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards).  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.   SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENT:  If the apparent successful respondent is a large business, the respondent will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting plan, which in accordance with Public law 97-507, requires the A/E firm to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.

Newport has a requirement for Test and Installation Support of a Underwater Camera System to be tested, integrated with interfacing hardware, then installed onboard submarines.  The period of performance will be two years.  This procurement will be awarded sole source to Konigsberg Maritime, Houston, TX.

As the designer and builder of this system, Konigsberg is the only company qualified to provide the necessary technical support.  The solicitation will be available no earlier than 23 April 2007.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/HQ intends to award a sole source contract to Hamilton Sundstrand pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This procurement is for on-orbit water production services using a Sabatier-reaction based system for the International Space Station. The Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) is contracting for a Sabatier-based reaction system for the International Space Station (ISS).  The contractor shall complete the Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) of the Sabatier System and NASA will pay only for the performance of the system upon operation on orbit as part of the ISS.  NASA will serve in a limited capacity to assure safety.  The contractor shall provide Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) along with Hazard Analysis.  NASA will handle launch, on-orbit operations, and maintenance within the defined mass and servicing levels defined by the contract.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary data products required for operation procedures, launch constraints, and others.   The Contractor shall conduct all technical DDT&E of the system.  The Contractor is responsible for showing that the system will be safe and not damage any other ISS hardware by meeting the provided interface and acceptance testing criteria. The contractor will develop, procure, and build flight hardware, support equipment needed for operations, and training material within a schedule to meet delivery at least 6 months before the currently scheduled ISS assembly mission 20A which has a current manifest planning date of April 2010.  If the contractor chooses another delivery schedule for the flight hardware, the contractor will need to meet the launch requirements for the proposed launch vehicle.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be for a minimum of five years of on orbit operations plus the time proposed for development and launch delivery.   The contractor will provide the capability for on-orbit maintenance including maintenance and logistics planning and provision of spare parts.  Any maintenance while on orbit of the system beyond the negotiated maintenance will incur a financial penalty on a per hour basis and consumables or replacement parts that are required beyond the negotiated plan needing to be delivered to the ISS will also incur a financial penalty on a mass basis.  To mitigate the on-orbit delivery of mass (operational unit and consumables) the contractor shall define an up mass delivery schedule that includes mass, volume, and delivery phasing.  These elements will be part of the detailed negotiation with the contractor and the result would be a performance metric in the payment calculation. The formula for calculating payment for the operational year is based on the completion of the performance evaluation criteria along with any penalties from crew time and deviation from mass and volume schedule. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Hamilton Sundstrand is the only source that can meet the Government requirements.  The groundwork in Sabatier technology previously undertaken by Hamilton Sundstrand and its industry team is unique and is completely appropriate for adaptation to the new service-based model Sabatier System for the International Space Station.  No other entity has the on-going and continuous past experience in combination with facilities and the financial resources and openness to the service-based contracting model.

<SUBJECT>59 -- RFI COLLABORATION CAPABILITY FOR THE JOINT MISSION PLANNING SYSTEM (JMPS)
<SOLNBR>R1531
<CONTACT>Alan Salus al.salus.ctr@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Electronic Systems Center (ESC), 951 ELSG/EI, the Engineering and Integration Division on behalf of the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is conducting market research and as such is requesting information from Industry about standards, techniques and architecture-based design, implementation and stewardship approaches to assist in establishing the necessary information to construct a Statement of Objectives for incorporating a collaborative mission planning capability in the JMPS.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  This RFI is being conducted to determine potential approaches to satisfy collaboration - which is described in four different general scenarios: collaboration among like-aircraft operating in a single mission; dissimilar aircraft performing different functions in a coordinated multi-element package; dissimilar aircraft executing different tasking in close proximity to each other; and lastly, collaboration between tactical planners and higher headquarters with tasking being modified real-time in response to feedback from the aircraft.  The following assumptions apply to all scenarios: all workstations participating in collaboration are at the same classification level (cross-domain data-sharing is not an option); and, each operator in a collaborative effort has a network-connected JMPS machine.  Technical approaches can range from a new development to a COTS/GOTS product running external to the JMPS framework. For additional technical detail, see the attachment.    To arrange for an optional demonstration of technology or techniques that may have a role in achieving a collaboration capability for JMPS, please contact Mr. Mike Giger (SAIC), (781) 266-9341 or Mike.Giger.Ctr@hanscom.af.mil.  These demos are optional and will be entirely at the contractor's own expense.

<SUBJECT>B -- Basic Ordering Agreement - Consultant Services for Integrated Energy Planning Programs
<SOLNBR>RFP23413
<RESPDATE>042507
<ARCHDATE>05102007
<CONTACT>JoAnna Black, Sr. Contracts Specialist, Phone 631-344-3960, Fax 631-344-5499, Email jblack@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Assocuates is seeking competitive proposals (technical and price)from consultants to povide technical expertise and analytical support for integrated energy planning programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 

The resultant contract for this work will be a 5-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  All work under this BOA will be issued by subsequent task orders, inclusive of Statements of Work.  The task orders will include work for all areas described herein.
  
The general description of the scope of work is as follows: 
The Energy, Environmental and Economics Analysis Group (EEEAG) of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) provides technical expertise and analytical support for integrated energy planning programs.  Services include program assessment, policy analysis, energy and water technology assessment, environmental planning, and economic analysis.  Current EEEAG clients include several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offices, as well as other federal agencies, local governments, foreign countries, and others.  

In particular, EEEAG is home to the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) family of models, developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to support long-term strategic energy planning.  In this capacity, EEEAG staff are responsible for maintaining and enhancing several MARKAL model variants for DOE clients, including the U.S. MARKAL national and regional models, and a global MARKAL model, the Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) model.  Past work with DOE has included assistance on The System to Analyze Energy Markets (SAGE) model, an international MARKAL variant. 

From time to time EEEAG staff requires information related to the electricity sector formulation in the MARKAL model and its several variants.  The MARKAL model depends on a carefully considered balance between data aggregation and model structure to accurately portray the behavior of electricity markets.  Because of the central role of electricity in the U.S. and world energy markets, it is necessary from time to time to update MARKAL models to reflect new conditions and DOE Program requirements as they relate to the electricity sector.

In addition, BNL occasionally has need to obtain data from another DOE model, the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), in order to carry out certain funded tasks in support of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) benefits analysis for DOE, or for other purposes.  The NEMS model is the official DOE U.S. energy model, and the BNL U.S. MARKAL model must be consistent with the information it contains in order to carry out the BNL work for DOE supporting the GPRA analysis

To perform the tasks assigned to it by the DOE sponsors on short notice and in a timely manner, BNL/EEEAG seeks expertise from a qualified contractor under a Basic Ordering Agreement to:
•	provide specific expertise as requested in the appropriate representation of the electricity sector in MARKAL and its variants,  
•	assist with the necessary calibration of MARKAL and NEMS by providing the required information from NEMS in the form necessary to operate MARKAL, and
•	provide techncial support related to the NEMS model structure and data formulation as requested.  

The technical proposal must show the consultant's capability (previous and present experience) in fulfulling similar activities described herein.  The technical proposal must also show objective evidence of the consultant's  current expertise and past experience in all three of the following areas:
  
1.	Extensive understanding of electricity markets and how to represent these markets in the energy system model MARKAL at any level of geographic aggregation. 
2.	Current and demonstrated past experience with the formulation of the MARKAL model or its variants.
3.	Current and demonstrated past experience with the formulation and operation of the NEMS model.
In addition, the contractor must demonstrate that he can immediately provide assistance, without a learning curve.

Only consultants with experience in the three aformentioned areas will be considered for evaluation. 

The first task order under this BOA will be for assistance to enhance the formulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. national and regional MARKAL models.

All technical and price proposals are to be submitted by email to the attention of JoAnna Black, Procurement Supervisor, at jblack@bnl.gov.  The date and time established for receipt of proposals is 1:00 pm (local time) on April 25, 2007. 

All inquiries are to be submitted by email to the attention of JoAnna Black, procurement Supervisor, at jblack@bnl.gov.  telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.


This is a best value procurement. Technical Capability, Specialized Experience, and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
USPS Air Transportation CMC
Washington, DC


Please be advised that the US Postal Service has contacted selected integrated air cargo airlines who may be interested in providing air transportation service from many origins in the Continental United States, through an integrated hub, to San Juan, PR.  A solution meeting the following (minimally) is envisioned:
•	USPS will contract with a Certificated US Part 121 Air Carrier .
•	Integrated air cargo network approach.
•	Carrier must be able to transport parcels exceeding 16 ounces in accordance with TSA regulations
•	Estimated Average Weekday volume in pounds: 35,000
•	Desired Frequency of Service:  Tuesday through Sunday (X1)

We expect that this work will constitute incremental volume and revenue for the successful supplier.

Within 90 days of start-up, supplier must initiate bar code scanning of individual mail pieces to include EDI transmission of the data to the Postal Service.

US Postal Service personnel screening and security requirements will also apply.

The Postal Service is supplying this notice to firms it believes can satisfy the requirements who are known to either currently perform such work domestically, or who have affirmatively expressed interest in the recent past.  The Postal Service believes that its market research has already identified a sufficient number of firms to provide for adequate competition; however, if you are interested and are currently performing integrated air cargo through a domestic hub, and if you do or can serve SJU out of that hub, you must, within 5 days, submit a request to be considered for this opportunity.

Your request should be directed to:
	via email:  umesh.k.sawhney@usps.gov and to:  leslie.a.griffith@usps.gov

with a fax copy to:  202-268-0000

The data fields and licenses can only be purchased from Lloyd's Register-Fairplay because the information from a ship database of a different vendor would be different from that used by the Coast Guard.  Because the VOS project provides a periodic ship authority file to the Amver system for use by the Coast Guard (through the NOAA Amver/SEAS server), buying this information from a different vendor would require monthly reconciliation between the Lloyd's-Register Fairplay information and the other vendor's information, requiring NOAA to have the Lloyd's-Register information anyway.

3.  Prior Pre-Qualification of Certain Offerors
	Offerors may pre-qualify on the basis of Phase I submissions that were evaluated and approved in previous years.

A.  Firms found pre-qualified for other Department of State work in fiscal year 2007 or 2006 or 2005 may pre-qualify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 

	Letter of Interest from Previously Pre-Qualified Offerors:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with paragraph A above and indicate for which projects pre-qualification is sought.  Changes in the Offeror?s structure, size status, or Primary Design-Build Team since the submission of the most recent approved D/B pre-qualification submission must be identified in the letter for DOS to review and evaluate.  Offerors must cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes have been made since pre-qualification.  Every change must be sent for evaluation regardless of how minor the Offeror may believe it is.

The Percy Amendment also requires exclusion of firms from countries that exclude U.S. firms from their diplomatic construction projects.  The requirements of the Act will be applied to all Phase II proposals received.  The Offeror must complete and submit as part of its pre-qualification package the Percy Amendment Certification Form."  (The form is attached to this FEDBIZOPPS announcement and may be obtained from the DOS Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice.)

DOS will evaluate whether the Offeror?s proposal

1.  demonstrates capability to provide professional qualifications, specialized experience, and technical competence in design as well as design-build of domestic or international projects involving multiple contractor and subcontractor disciplines; 

2.  demonstrates that the Offeror and its design team have either individually or collectively been successful in accomplishing the design (preferably design-build) of projects of a similar scope, complexity and dollar value as the project for which prequalification is requested; 

3.  demonstrates that the D/B team will have sufficient capacity, including sufficient financial, professional, personnel, and facility resources, to accomplish the project(s). 

FACTOR 3: PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE

Offeror shall submit detailed information concerning Federal, State, and Local Government, and private contracts that demonstrate ability to perform D/B projects similar to those for which prequalification is requested.  Performance shall have been within the last three years.  These contracts may have been executed by other divisions, corporate management, or critical subcontractors, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort. 

	Information for each contract shall include Offeror?s company/division; project name; customer contact and agency/company; contract number; brief description of effort and relevance to the proposed effort; type, value and performance period of contract; Offeror?s role in the work (prime or sub); name, address and telephone number of current or last Program Project Manager, Contracting Officer, and/or Contract Manager.  Offeror may include additional relevant information demonstrating significant achievements or explain performance problems it considers relevant to the proposed efforts. 

	DOS will evaluate whether the Offeror?s past performance for other customers and its past performance for DOS demonstrate conformance to specifications and compliance with contract terms and conditions, including subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged businesses; adherence to contract schedules; effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract costs; conformance to construction safety plans; adherence to security requirements; responsiveness and business-like concern for the customer; and effective management of subcontractors and key personnel, including timely award of subcontracts and selection, retention, and replacement (when necessary) of key personnel. 

As prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 15.305(a)(2)(iv), an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will receive a neutral rating.  Offerors that meet the other requirements described in this notice are invited to submit a statement of the Offeror?s business structure (e.g., Joint Venture, integrated contractor), and design and construction portfolios that illustrate the D/B contractor?s capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The following replaces the previous announcement in its entirety. We apologize for any confusion caused by the initial submission.<br> <br> 1.	The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. <br> <br> 2.	CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.  The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. <br> <br> 3.	CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with an option for production.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified. <br> <br> 4.	Please provide answers to the following questions.  Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 20 December 2005 to: <br> jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.	Are you interested in competing for this requirement?  If so, will you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? <br> b.	Are you a Small Business?

Please describe your experience in one or two paragraphs. <br> <br>  See Note 26.

Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: W. Tirenin, IFGB and reference BAA 06-11.   Electronic submission to Walt.Tirenin@rl.af.mil is strongly preferred, or white papers on CD can be addressed to AFRL/IFGB (W. Tirenin), 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA 06-11.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 

(1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach;

(2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the National Intelligence Community's Information Assurance requirements, 

(3) Approach for evaluation of the technology; 

(4) The prospect for effective transfer of technology produced into the Intelligence Community; and 

(5) The reasonableness and realism of: proposed costs, fee (if any), and program milestones/schedule. 

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate and the Disruptive Technology Office (DTO) has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

The Government may use the services of Omen Inc., Scitor Corp, Teknoworks, Mitre, and Institute for Defense Analysis personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to the appropriate level of information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY.  Prior to award, the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

    Walt Tirenin
    Telephone:  (315) 330-1871

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Government has a requirement for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified commercial hardware solution to the requirements of GPS Message Router (GMR) performance specification (AVNS-PRF-10824).  The GMR will have internal GPS capability, si x (6) Ethernet IEEE 802.3 10/100 base T interface ports, three high speed, multi-protocol serial interface ports serial ports (EIA-232 or EIA-422 synchronous or asynchronous serial communication), at least one 480 Mbps USB (USB 2.0) port and will meet mili tary environmental requirements.  The GMR will provide the interface between the Air Warrior computer (EDM) and the Aircraft mounted GPS antenna and the Blue Force Tracking (BFT) transceiver.     This effort will be accomplished in two phases.  In the first phase, based upon full and open competition, firm-fixed price contract(s) not to exceed $300,000 will be  awarded to a maximum of two offerors for the delivery of four (4) production representat ive hardware samples and functional demonstration software.  The intent of Phase I is to promote competition through the delivery and initial Government evaluation of actual product samples. Competition for this effort will be limited to contractors who sa tisfy the following three requirements: -- Contractor must be Free from Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI). --Contractor must have a facility clearance of SECRET or higher in accordance with DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). --Contractor is required to have a COMSEC account established by the US Government. This requirement is specified in DoD 5220.22A, Communications (COMSEC) Security Annex.   The Phase II procurement is for a 5-year IDIQ production contract that will be limited to the offeror(s) selected for the Phase I effort.  The estimated total lifetime hardware purchases from the Phase II contract is 6,000 units.  The Government will relea se a Phase II RFP with a production statement of work to the selected offeror(s) approximately 45-60 day prior to the specified delivery date for the Phase I hardware samples.  Offeror(s) shall submit their Phase II proposal concurrently with the delivery of their four GMR hardware samples required as deliverables for Phase I.  The Phase II RFP will require the offeror to provide pricing data to perform the production statement of work and provide GMR unit price data.  The contractor with the lowest price a nd technically acceptable hardware, as determined through the performance of limited Government acceptance testing, will be awarded the Phase II production contract.   The release of the Phase I RFP is anticipated on or about 15 May 07.

Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified herein below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance.<BR><BR> Contact ClientServices@FedBid.com or call 1-877-9FEDBID to address any questions of comments<BR><BR>New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and NO "gray market"<BR><BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission<BR><BR>FOB Destination CONUS (CONtinental U.S.)<BR><BR>Delivery shall be within 30 days or order<BR><BR>Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: ·	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  ·	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. ·	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. ·	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the scanners soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the Datalogic Gryphon Barcode Scanner in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>J. Paul Hardin, Contracting Officer, 210-977-3493
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for GROUND OPERATING EQUIPMENT (GOE) INCREMENT 1<br> <br> 1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. <br> <br> 2.   CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. <br> <br> 3.   This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don't intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary. <br> <br> 4.   Please provide answers to the following questions.  Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 14 December 2005 to: jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.  Are you interested in competing for this requirement?  If so, will you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? <br> <br> b.  Are you a Small Business?  If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? <br> <br> c.  Do you have similar experience in development and/or production of these type devices?  Please describe your experience in one or two paragraphs. <br> <br> See Note 26.

Develops and implements financial management improvements and the way the Bureau tracks, manages, and monitors the usage of these funds.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and agency broad program goals and policy statements, OMB circulars, directives, and regulations, Treasury Department regulations, judicial decisions, and CG decisions. Guidelines also include the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, and various appropriation acts. These guidelines are frequently inadequate in providing criteria for resolving problems that arise, such as evaluating unusual requests. The employee uses ingenuity and originality in interpreting, applying, and deviating from established procedures and techniques for the purpose of establishing specific procedures to be followed in the expenditure and accounting of funds.


Complexity

Work consists of selecting and using many different and unrelated analytical techniques and methods in the financial management work performed in support of INL's post-conflict programs, much of which is performed under tight deadlines, due to the critical nature of the program. The employee makes recommendations concerning changes in funding and budget plans that conform to changes in the substantive programs. Established criteria to identify and measure financial accomplishments, and develop methods to improve the effectiveness with which programs are administered. Incumbent works closely with the division Chief and other senior specialists, both within the Division and elsewhere in the Bureau, to identify and measure financial accomplishments, to develop methods to improve the over-all effectiveness of the program, and to evaluate the impact of changes when funding cuts are imposed. Sound judgment is required in making recommendations that are critical in nature and involved sensitive, political issues relating to country projects, requiring that the incumbent keep abreast of activities vis-à-vis the impact of changes in funding.

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances – the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.
 
II.  MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

•	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
•	Extensive experience in the financial management field, including a mastery of the concepts, principles, practices, laws and regulation which apply to financial management analysis and budgeting for substantive programs and services including expert knowledge of OMB and congressional laws, regulations, policies and directives. One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-12 level in the federal service.
•	Ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing and to interact with individuals at all levels.

Desirable Qualifications

•	 A Bachelor’s Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or financial management.
•	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications. Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise.

III. POSITIONAL ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent reports to the Division Chief of other senior specialist as designated by the Chief, with whom he/she develops a mutual acceptable project plan that typically includes identification of the work to be done, the scope of the project, and deadlines for its completion. Within the parameters of the approved project plan, the employee establishes and executes a work schedule, insuring that the necessary planning, coordination, approvals, negotiation, and other requirements are completed in a timely manner so as not to adversely impact the delay of any assigned contracts. Incumbent works independently but keeps the supervisor appraised of potentially controversial findings, issues, or problems with widespread impact. Work is reviewed for soundness of overall approach, effectiveness in meeting requirements, and effectiveness of recommendations.

The Bureau of Public Debt on behalf of  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor for synthesis and recommendations on the design and specification of interior and exterior lighting for people who have low vision.

BACKGROUND
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is an independent federal agency concerned with accessibility for people with disabilities.  The Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility guidelines to ensure that newly constructed and altered buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.  In November 1999, the Access Board issued a proposed rule to revise and update its accessibility guidelines.  During the public comment period on the proposed rule, the Access Board received comments from individuals with vision impairments about the need for standards for interior and exterior lighting.  Commenters from deafness organizations also noted the need for adequate lighting for sign language communication.  Similar comments were made at the Board’s public information meeting on July 25, 2006.  In addition, the January 2001 report of the Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee (PROWAAC) recommends research to define specifications for exterior lighting levels in the pedestrian environment.  No current US lighting industry standards include provisions or recommendations for lighting levels that serve the needs of people who have vision impairments, including the large and growing population of individuals with age-related vision loss.  While the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (1991) sets minimum lighting levels for elevator car controls, platform, and car threshold and landing sills (ADAAG 4.10.11), no other lighting minima or characteristics are specified.  These provisions were retained in the 2004 ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines.  

Much is known about illumination levels, types, and criteria that will support low-vision users;  recommendations are available from a variety of resources in the US and abroad, including The Lighthouse, Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, Johns Hopkins Eye Research Institute, the Council of Citizens with Low Vision International, the American Foundation for the Blind, The Society of Light and Lighting in the UK, and Queen’s University in Canada.  Key issues include:

	--color rendering;
 	--color and luminance contrast;
	--glare;
	--emergency and egress route illumination levels;
	--exterior route illumination levels; and
	--lamp types, fixtures, and mountings.

OBJECTIVE
The Board seeks a consultant knowledgeable in low-vision lighting issues to produce a synthesis of current U.S. and international knowledge, research, standards, and recommendations on interior and exterior lighting for low-vision users.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Working with the Board and other experts, including lighting standards developers, the consultant shall identify and review completed and current research and standards, both US and international, that are relevant to interior and exterior illumination for people who have low vision.  From this information and input, the consultant shall research and develop a synthesis that describes the current state of science in this subject area and formulate recommendations for comprehensive new guidelines for interior and exterior illumination that can be further developed by the Board for incorporation into the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines.  The synthesis shall identify locations where accessible lighting levels are critical for usability. In addition, locations where lighting may be needed for sign language communication must be identified.

The synthesis shall include a consensus of expert recommendations on interior and exterior lighting characteristics for low-vision users, identification and discussion of key issues requiring resolution, and recommendations for future research.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The Contractor shall meet with the CO within 30 days of project award.  The final report shall be submitted for review and approval within 120 days of project award.  Alternate formats shall be submitted within 15 days of approval of the final draft.   A presentation to the Board will be scheduled at a time of mutual convenience.

 The Bureau of Public Debt on behalf of  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor for synthesis and recommendations on measures of work efficiency and related issues in manual wheel chair use on cross slopes on outdoor pedestrian surfaces.

BACKGROUND
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is an independent federal agency concerned with accessibility for people with disabilities.  The Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility guidelines to ensure that newly constructed and altered buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.  In June 2002, the Board published draft guidelines  for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way that included provisions that set maximum cross slope of an accessible outdoor pedestrian route at 2%, consistent with standards first developed in 1980 for routes in buildings and on sites.  

Several research projects on human factors in manual wheelchair use have identified cross slope as a key factor in usability.  However, there is no consensus on method or measurement protocols for assessing the effects of cross slope on the mobility and safety of people who use manual wheelchairs outdoors. Some highway industry research has employed methods that purport to show that cross slopes that exceed 2% do not exacerbate the difficulty of manual wheelchair travel, perhaps because only one arm is used in forward motion, the other being used for braking.  The physics of cross slope, on the other hand, show that a 5% cross slope requires resistance to a downturning force more than double that at 2%.  The US Access Board believes that standard human factors measures developed for ambulatory persons may not reflect considerations significant to manual wheelchair users.

OBJECTIVE
The Board seeks a consultant to look at the research record on manual wheelchair users and nondisabled subjects, including athletes in both categories, and extract information needed to produce a compare-and-contrast analysis (method-to-method and between populations) of :

--the various measures of energy use, effort, efficiency, and work utilized in 
  human factors research today (SmartWheel, oxygen uptake; carbon dioxide 
  expulsion; heart rate, user perceptions, etc.); and

--the physiological parameters of human performance (lactic acid threshold, 
  resting/maximum heart rate, MET values, maximum power produced, etc).

In addition to these comparisons/analyses, develop factors that address the related effects of cross slope on manual wheelchair users, including:

--surface moisture that may lead to slipping; 
--the stability and tipping points of wheelchairs; 
--caster flutter effects; 
--one-armed propulsion effects (e.g., loss of momentum); 
--arm and shoulder fatigue;  and 
--repetitive stress injuries that over time can affect independence and overall 
  mobility in both travel and transfer.

From these data and comparisons, characterize the ‘accuracy’ of various methodologies in assessing manual wheelchair mobility and recommend and support a methodology of choice.   In addition, make recommendations about future research directions and data needs that might further refine mobility measures.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In consultation with the Board, human factors researchers, and experts on wheelchair mobility, the consultant shall identify and review completed and current research in this subject area and develop a plan to gather, compare, and present the data needed for this study. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The Contractor shall meet with the CO within 30 days of project award.  The final report shall be submitted for review and approval within 240 days of project award.  Alternate formats shall be submitted within 15 days of approval of the final draft.   A presentation to the Board will be scheduled at a time of mutual convenience.

Responses to this announcement shall be sent to:  Gina Hanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 304-480-7181, Fax (304) 480-7204, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov by 2:00 p.m., Eastern time April 23, 2007.  Responses shall include Company Name, DUNS #, Size Standard, address, telephone number, point of contact, email address and brief capabilities statement .

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR RESPONSE BY SMALL BUSINESS ONLY. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541380 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF $11 MILLION LIMIT ANNUAL RECEIPTS.  

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to provide laboratory services for the National Children's Study.  The support services being sought are related to the analysis of specified chemicals and microbiological agents in environmental samples of soil, dust, air, water, and food that will be collected throughout the study (as described below).  NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities of SMALL (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) BUSINESS organizations interested in providing these services.  

Background 
The Children’s Health Act of 2000 authorized the NICHD and a consortium of other Federal Agencies to “…plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to ...incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences of children's well-being.”  That study is now known as the National Children's Study (NCS).  Investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)--including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)--and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as other Federal agencies, have been planning and have begun to implement this study.  The NCS will study the complex relationship between health and the environment through long-term follow-up of approximately 100,000 children and their families across the United States. 
Study planners have identified the following child health areas as priorities for the NCS: pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavior, injury, asthma, obesity, and physical development.  As a result of the many study hypotheses being considered for the NCS, as well as the anticipation that other hypotheses will emerge during the course of the Study and afterward, several million environmental samples will be collected over the life of the project. 
Environmental samples to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to: soil, dust wipes, vacuumed dust, particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants collected onto filters and passive samplers, tap water, and food samples.  Many of these samples are expected to require immediate analysis.  However, depending upon stability and Study needs, other samples will be stored between 6 and -80 °C in the NCS Biological and Environmental Sample Repository (NICHD Contract).  These samples will be withdrawn over time and sent to laboratories for analysis as required.It is expected that 90% of all environmental samples collected will be analyzed within one year after collection. In addition, the laboratory may be requested to package and ship unused portions of samples or prepared samples (ampulated vials of sample digestate or extract) to the NCS Repository.  Laboratories must be able to provide results of analysis, quality control data, and raw data in an electronic data delivery format to be specified by the Government. 
Plans for sample collection and analysis for the Study are evolving. At present, the specific types of environmental analyses required along with the analytes of interest within the first 5 years of collection are listed in Table 1.

A contract is anticipated to be used for the National Children’s Study Environmental Laboratories.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will need to stipulate which item numbers they propose to analyze. Capability statements will be evaluated separately against the following technical areas of experience and expertise for each facility (specific physical location/address where specified sample(s) will be analyzed):  

a)	Laboratory Facility Experience and Expertise.  Provide names of projects (for government experience: contract number, contract officer and technical representative; for non-government experience: contact name, address and phone number), distinguishing previous experience from current projects.   Response must include number of samples as well as duration and description of services provided, in sufficient detail to demonstrate: 

i.	Extensive experience by the facility in analyzing the types and volumes of samples as listed in Table 1.  

ii.	Experience in receiving and processing the types of samples as listed in Table 1.  

iii.	Experience in repackaging and shipping unused portions and prepared samples according to federal, state and local regulations.  

iv.	Experience in handling special environmental sample types.  
 
v.	Capability for an electronic information system to document receipt, process, analysis, and disposal or shipment of samples.

vi.	Capability to support and adhere to standard electronic data delivery formats, such as the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) or the Environmental Standards Data Council (EDSC) Environmental Sampling, Analysis Results (ESAR).  Specify the standard(s) currently utilized at the facility.  

vii.	Personnel with demonstrated ability and experience to manage a large long-term project.

viii.	Personnel with demonstrated expertise in computerized sample and data management. 

ix.	Participation in appropriate quality assurance and quality control programs.  Include the names of external proficiency, performance, or accreditation programs the facility participates in, the dates of participation, and the status of performance for the last two years. 

b)	Facilities:  
i.	Provide a brief description of the facilities and demonstrate the laboratory facility’s capability to perform the analyses on the environmental matrices and the analysis(es).

ii.	Capability to handle emergency situations, such as equipment or computer system failure.  


c)	Service Capabilities: Demonstrate the capability to provide services in the following areas for a study of the size and breadth of the NCS:


i.	Accessibility: a. Ability to host site visit audits for pre-award, post-award or other QC purposes.  b. Facilities open and staffed to receive samples 365 days per year with appropriate and sufficient staff available for emergencies.  


In addition to the above information, the organization may submit any additional information for each submitted facility capability statement that they believe is pertinent, in particular, the analytical methods used for listed measures and recommended alternatives that are technically equivalent yet provide potential cost savings, and experience in method development and research, e.g., pesticide method development.  Do not submit facility manuals or protocols. 

Interested organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project must submit two (2) original signed hard copies of their capability statement addressing the areas above.  Respondents may submit their capability statements via e-mail in addition to the two hard copies.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 4:00PM local time on May 4, 2007.  Capability statements must identify the business status of the organization (small business, 8 (a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB).   NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  See NUMBER NOTE 25. 

Responses are to be submitted separately for each facility at which analyses will be performed.  Each response should be no more than 25 pages, including any attachments.  Clearly indicate the facility location/address and the measure(s) which would be analyzed by that specific facility on the top of the first page of each response.  Limit information presented to the facility and measures(s) indicated on the response. Each facility will be evaluated independently.

<CONTACT>Shelley Marken, 301-619-8443
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify nontraditional defense contractors (A nontraditional Defense contractor is one that for a period of one year has not entered into or performed on any contract in excess  of $500,000 to carry out prototype projects or to perform basic, applied, or advanced research projects for a Federal agency that is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations) that believe they have viable candidate drugs or biologics that can be exp editiously developed and will provide a safe and effective medical countermeasure against radiation injury.  The Department of Defense, through the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office, is gauging interest of industry, especially nontraditional defense contractors, in the Advanced Development of therapeutic medical countermeasures to treat acute radiation syndrome (ARS) using award instruments other than procurement contracts.  Drugs or biologics proposed shoul d, when administered following exposure to ionizing radiation, decrease incapacity and prolong survival by treating the gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome of ARS.  Specifically, when administered following exposure to ionizing radiation, the medical countermea sure should either prevent or reduce the extent of incipient radiation injury or promote repair of manifest radiation injury to allow preservation or restoration of the anatomic integrity and normal physiologic functioning of the GI tract.  The Award Recip ient will be responsible for conducting Technology Development and System Development activities and selecting and managing Subcontractors capable of conducting various activities associated with drug or biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Depending on the technical maturity of the proposed technology, activities may include process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant smal l scale manufacturing and testing of the product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in accordance with FDA Good Clinical Practices (GCP) regulations and guidelines.  These therapeutic medical radiation countermeasures are being developed in response to a requirement to treat service members for the effects of radiation injury and to allow commanders to sust ain and continue operations in the event of nuclear or radiological attacks on U.S. Forces.  Prospective products should have substantiated in vivo safety and efficacy data that clearly demonstrate the potential for further development into a FDA-approved drug or biologic.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, however, parties interested in responding must furnish, in writing, a 1-2 page synopsis of their candidate which clearly supports its therapeutic potential and the ability of the Responden t to perform the tasks associated with Advanced Development. The inclusion of in vivo data in the synopsis is encouraged.  MITS is contemplating the use of funding instruments such as grants, technology investment agreements, or other transactions.  The re sponse should indicate the type of award instrument of interest.  Any information received in response to this Sources Sought Notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. This information may be submitted via mail, e-mail, or fax.  All re sponses shall be submitted by no later than May 2, 2007 by 4:00 pm EDT in order to be accepted for review.  All paperwork must be sent to U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: Shelley Marken, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, MD 21702, Fax ( 301) 619-5069 or by e-mail to shelley.marken@det.amedd.army.mil.  The NAICS code is 541710.  This notice should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or an  obligation on the part of the U.S. Government and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<SUBJECT>61--Power Converter/Transformer (PCT) Requirements for 53rd Signal Battalion
<SOLNBR>W91260-07-T-0005
<RESPDATE>042407
<ARCHDATE>06232007
<CONTACT>George P Knowlton IV, 719-554-1967
<DESC>This is a Request For Information from U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Strategic Command (SMDC ARSTRAT). Power Converter/Transformer (PCT) requirements for 53rd Signal Battalion:  Convert power 208/120, 3 Phase, 50hZ to 208/120, 3 Phase, 60hZ with a wye connector on both the input and output sides.  Planned location is on the north end of the main island Japan.  The maximum output required is 300 Amps (this replaces a 100KW generator as power source).  Prefer converter to also be capable to condition the power, i.e., TVSS.  Converter must be able to withstand all weather conditions with minimum protection from rain, snow, summer humid/heat and some salt air corrosion potential (not directly adjacent to the shore).  Ambient temperat ures range will be from approximately  -20F to 100F.  Delivery requirement is to U.S. Army SMDC/ARSTRAT, Peterson AFB, CO 80914 for trans-shipment by government to final destination. I have a copy of a power connection (one line) diagram available. Please send me email requesting it and Ill em ail it to you. What is the input voltage on the primary side of the Site Transformer? The prime power distribution is 4160 v.  A phase to ground value.  Do we need to supply the transformer and input disconnect to the motor generator (MG) set? We do not have a transformer at the proposed site dedicated to these requirements; one would have to be purchased and installed by SMDC to support the beddown. I und erstand that to mean that we would provide the funds, but that they would provide all the labor and material to get power to our site, to include the necessary transformer. Again, we'll have to validate details, but I don't believe that we will need the MG  supplier to provide a transformer nor the secondary feeder and power disconnect for the MG. Do you need a 300A output? If so we would need a 400A feed. Is this available? From what I know about the current and future power requirements for our equipment, we will probably never exceed a 200a, 3 phase load at 120/208v. Therefore, I believe the refe renced 300a output with 400a service feeder would be overkill.  The supplier should design the MG to accommodate the max 200a load for our equipment plus whatever load the MG itself generates, to include temporary power (amperage) surge due to motor load s tart upon.  Supplier should be able to provide us with a recommended feeder service size and rated time delay overcurrent protection device (breaker) based upon above and address this in their quote. Is the dB level a concern as it seems that the unit would be outdoors? We believe anything below about 85 dba meets minimum OSHA standards for noise levels and should not be a problem if located outdoors. Our experience (positive) in the past has been with motor-generators.  This is our preferred converter type but would consider argument for solid state.   Request the following information in your cabilities statement/pricing quotation. 1. Are there recommended spare parts, support equipment or cabinet options? 2.  Request the PCT weight and cube information and the weight and cube information in delivered shipping container configuration.  3.  Request pictures, hook-up specifications and other drawings that will help our design for installation of the PCT.  Are there any ground mounting considerations or recommendations.  4.  When operating are there noise hazard considerations?  Estimated dB level? 5.  What is the warranty provided?  Is there an extended warranty plan available and what is the cost? 6.

<SUBJECT>D -- CUSTOM LAB APPLICATIONS ON DISCONTINUED EQUIPMENT
<DESC>This is an intent to sole source. The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has a requirement for support for the Laboratory Sample Flow System (LSFS) and Microbiological and Residue Computer System (MARCIS).  The applications supported by these systems require a high level of expertise in the agency’s data and reporting requirements as well as the sampling programs conducted. The expertise must be of a level to quickly troubleshoot problems with applications.  There is a need for the contractor to have intimate knowledge and experience in the operation and function of these highly specialized applications. The contractor must possess specific equipment with which to accomplish the process. The contractor must be able to develop modules for existing applications to accommodate the agency’s changing sampling programs and reporting needs.

USDA/FSIS intends to purchase these services from ID Enterprises Inc.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is Citation 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The prospective follow-on procurement will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Fixed Price contract with a one year period of performance and four option years.   

The objective of this procurement is to continue to support and provide enhancement to these critical agency applications until such time as they are replaced.  The agency’s minimum need is to have a contractor with in-depth knowledge of these applications to provide support and enhancements and a statistician with intimate knowledge of the Agency’s sampling and testing programs.  The current customized software and HP 3000 hardware are a necessary component to this requirement as they are the vehicle to be used for the data warehousing of the analytical results and sample disposition until the final phase of validation is implemented on the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and the Public Health Data Suite (which includes PREP, LEARN, M2K and eSAMPLE) is fully implemented.  

ID Enterprises has developed and continues to maintain mission critical applications for the agency.  This company provides a source of immediate knowledge of the detailed and complex sampling criteria and rules for the many and various sampling programs conducted by the agency.  The applications maintained by ID Enterprises are mission critical to the agency’s laboratories to provide timely data to agency field and headquarter’s personnel on sample status and laboratory results of product or carcasses which may be held pending laboratory results. The time and expense of training another contractor in all the nuances of the agency sample and reporting programs as well as the complexities of the custom software would result in unacceptable delays to meeting the requirements of the Agency and public safety.  One of the critical applications resides on antiquated hardware (HP3000 series 948) no longer supported by the manufacturer.  ID Enterprises owns and maintains a compatible HP 3000 system running the same level MPE/iX operating system and software platform.  This allows ID Enterprises to test and develop software in-house without putting an excessive load on the agency systems prior to implementation of software updates or edits.  Until existing applications can be replaced, it is mandatory to keep them operating.  The contractor statistician has extensive knowledge of the statistics used to publish the final Rule on Pathogen Reduction Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (PR/HACCP) Systems which focus to reduce both pathogenic organisms on meat and poultry products and the incidence of food borne illness associated with these products.  The expertise is used extensively in the development of new performance standards for baseline studies, HACCP for Residues, and microbiological testing program for Ready-to-Eat, E.coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria mono and other pathogen testings.   With the implementation of electronic collection of information and submission of forms the statistician performs extensive Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) of the data, screens and reporting.

There is an urgent need to maintain and enhance these custom applications as the agency mission to collect, analyze and report sample results involves the public health.  Samples collected and submitted for testing are typically held in the establishments until laboratory results are received.  Notification of presumptive and confirmed positive samples utilizes these applications.  Protecting the public health is at stake in assuring these applications function continuously.  ID Enterprises owns and maintains HP3000 systems. ID Enterprises has a staff of programmers and a statistician with intimate knowledge of the agency sampling programs and the specialized software applications. 

This is sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes only on responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.       Interested contractors may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contract no later than 3:00 pm local time on April 23, 2007.   Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be submitted to Lorna Craig, Contracting Officer, at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Mail Drop 5230 Beltsville, MD 20705-230.  Responses will also be accepted by fax at 301-504-4276 or by e-mail at Lorna.Craig@fsis.usda.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Subject Matter Experts (SME) to Support Operational Test
<DESC>ANNOUNCMENT:
The United States Air Force, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) seeks small business sources for subject matter experts (SME) to support operational tests.  This FedBizOpps notice is an announcement seeking market information on small businesses capable of providing the services described herein.  AFOTEC is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  The information requested by this Request for Information (RFI) will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  For the purpose of this RFI, the anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, engineering, and Life Sciences, and the small business size standard in number of people is 500.

This RFI is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.


SYNOPSIS OF THE REQUIREMENT:
The mission of AFOTEC is to test and evaluate new weapons systems in realistic battlespace environments to provide decision makers accurate, balanced, and complete assessments of mission capability.  AFOTEC conducts these tests at various locations throughout the US and sometimes at deployed locations.  The new weapons systems AFOTEC tests include Air Force and joint aircraft; air armament; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR); and space systems.

Many AFOTEC programs require subject matter experts (SME) to conduct plausible operational tests and evaluations (OT&E).  Technical expertise is required for OT&E concepts, planning, execution, and reporting.  Tasks would cover the range from advice, education and training, test and evaluation (T&E) design, data analysis, and reporting.  Specifically, SMEs could be required for coordinating multiple test team activities, program presentations, and team meetings; participating in T&E documentation preparation (test concepts, test plans, data management and analysis plans, detailed test procedures, and reports); collating and basic analysis of information for both internal and external daily, weekly, and monthly reports; maintaining a test database system; scheduling internal and external test team meetings; coordinating test team logistics; and monitoring deliverables against plans and flagging any potential problems.

The length of time a SME could be required depends on the program, the program’s stage in the acquisition cycle, the money available for test, and the amount of work needed to answer specific test measures.  Thus, the length of time could range from a few months to a few years.  Also, the time the SME is needed may not be in just one block of time.  The SME may be needed at various stages of the test program.  For example, the SME may be required to work on the program for four months, not needed for six months, and then be required for a year to finish the program.  The time between the determination of the need for SME support and the beginning of work may be as little as two weeks.

For the purposes of this RFI, a SME is
-	an individual who exhibits the highest level of expertise in performing a specialized job, task, or skill within an organization, or
-	an academic expert in a particular discipline, and/or
-	an operator.
SME operators may be required when AF personnel are not available due to manning shortages or the demands of real-world operations.


REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:
AFOTEC requests Capability Statements include the following.

1.  Company name, address, point of contact (POC), telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, NAICS code, GSA schedules held, small business type (8(a), small disadvantaged business, HUBZone, minority-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, etc.).

2.  Demonstrate the ability to provide SME support for short periods of time (1 to 4 months) on short notice (as little as 2 weeks from need determination to work start).

3.  Demonstrate the ability to provide SME support for broken blocks of support time (e.g., 2 months working the program, 4 months with no support for the program, 6 months back working the program, etc.).

	3.a.  Demonstrate the ability to provide the same SME in question 3 for the same labor cost.

	3.b.  Demonstrate the ability to delay SME support if there is a delay in a test program.

4.  Demonstrate the ability to provide SME support at several locations.

5.  Demonstrate the ability to provide SMEs with clearances up to Top Secret with temporary access to Sensitive Compartmented Information.

<SUBJECT>R -- Pre-Solicitation Conference for CNI MEO Partnering Initiative
<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Philadelphia Contracting Dept. in concert with Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC), will jointly conduct a pre-solicitation conference on 04 May 2007 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM at the EDO Corporation facility located at 2800 Shirlington Road, 12th Floor, Arlington, VA 22206.  (See Directions Below).  This event is anticipated to last the entire scheduled duration.

In accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 (revised), Performance of Commercial Activities, public-private competitions for Commander, Navy Installations Command’s (CNIC) Emergency Management Dispatch Services and Non-Guard Security Support Services were announced in FedBizOpps on 29 and 30 Sept 2006.  Approximately 347 civilian and 110 military positions are affected by the public-private competition for Emergency Management Dispatch Services.  Approximately 461 civilians and 1,480 military positions are affected by the public-private competition for Non-Guard Security Support Services.  In order for the Agency Tender Official (ATO) to effectively compete with private industry, it has been determined to be in the government’s best interest to obtain private industry contractors (partners) to assist with creating the MEOs and resulting agency tenders.  If the government were the winning service provider as a result of the A-76 competitions, the industry contractors (partners) would then commence performance for those functions it proposed to perform in the agency tender.

The pre-solicitation conference is being conducted under the auspices of market research for purposes of engaging potential competitors in open forum dialogue to discuss the government’s intended partnering process.  This will include discussion of anticipated evaluation criteria, timelines and the format for Schedule B.  It is anticipated that a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be posted as an amendment to this Special Notice prior to the pre-solicitation conference.

<SUBJECT>--US Army Corps of Engineers Announces Resolution of Information Management/ Information Technology National A-76 Competition
<DESC>Reference Special Notice published on 21 June 2006, USA-SNOTE-060621-0005:  April 17, 2007The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has announced the final performance decision is in favor of the Most Efficient Organization for the Information Management/Inf ormation Technology A-76 competition. The new IM/IT operation is expected to save up to $1 billion over the next five years. The competition was initially completed in March 2006, and the Governments Most Efficient Organization (MEO) was selected based on  lowest price, technically acceptable.  After subsequent protests, the final performance decision is the selection of the MEO. The Corps will sign a Letter of Obligation with the MEO on April 19, 2007 and implementation of the new organization will begin i mmediately following.  The MEO organization, Army Corps of Engineers Information Technology (ACE-IT), will have a one-year phase in period, a one year base period, and four one-year option periods.  To deliver the full range of IM/IT services, ACE-IT has p artnered with Lockheed-Martin to provide contract support.  Lockheed-Martin worked closely with the team that developed the Governments tender under the competition to address contracting needs.  The ACE-IT organization will be headquartered in Vicksburg,  Miss., with 55 local offices at Corps offices throughout the U.S.  For subcontracting possibilities, please contact Mr. Bill Colmer at bill.colmer@usace.army.mil.  The competition began in June 2004, and involved work performed by approximately 1300 DOD c ivilian employees and more than 500 contractors at Corps locations throughout the United States.  The competition included the following services: (1) automation services and systems support, (2) communications services and systems support, (3) information  assurance service and support, (4) record management services and support, (5) printing and publication services, (6) visual information services, and (7) IM/IT Administration and Management.

Brand Name Justification - 
The Department has Symantec software installed in the Department's intranet environment. In order to have assistance from Symantec in case of a malfunctioning software product, the Department would need to have the support contract for all workstations across the enterprise. Without the contract, no support would be provided. It would not be cost effective and would be time consuming if the Department had to replace all of the software.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK (SOW):  EMBANKMENT MATERIAL TO RAISE USIBWC LEVEES FROM INTERNATIONAL DAM TO RIVERSIDE DAM.  I.  PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many Texas cities including El Paso, Presidio, McAllen-Mission, Harlingen, and Brownsville.  FEMA decertification of the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) levees in El Paso County, TX, in February 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  The USIBWC plans to raise approximately nine (9) miles of USIBWC levees in El Paso County to meet the minimum 3 feet of freeboard criteria.  This will enable USIBWC to certify the reach from International Dam to Riverside Dam, a portion of the Rio Grande Rectification Project before the end of calendar year 2007.  II.  DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 165,000 tons of embankment material to be delivered on USIBWC’s levees from International Dam to Riverside Dam.  All materials furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in this SOW.  The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.  III.  PROJECT LOCATION:  The Rio Grande Rectification Project is located along the Rio Grande in El Paso and Hudspeth Counties.  For this SOW, material will only be delivered on USIBWC levees in El Paso County.  Locations of these levees are shown on attached maps (available from USIBWC).  IV.  MATERIALS:  Embankment material shall consist of impervious materials classified in accordance with ASTM International, ASTM D 2487 as lean clay (CL), low plasticity silt (ML), sand containing more than 30 percent of clay (SC), and borderline clay and silt (CL-ML).  The material shall be free from: roots and other organic matter; contamination from hazardous, toxic or radiological substances; trash; debris; and frozen materials.  The material shall be such as to produce a stable embankment and shall have a minimum Plasticity Index (PI) of eight (8) and a maximum Plasticity Index (PI) of 30.  V.  MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS:  Measurement of embankment material shall be measured by the ton of 2,000 pounds dry weight in vehicles.  The Contractor shall provide a standard platform truck scale conforming to the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 520 “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.”  The dry weight will be determined by deducting the weight of the moisture in the material at the time of weighing from the gross weight of the material.  The moisture in the material will be determined in accordance with Test Method Tex 103-E at least once each day.  Prior to first delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officers’ Representative (COR), a written report of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of Item 520.  When inaccuracy or inadequacy is discovered, scale use will not be resumed until corrective measure has been completed and/or the scales calibrated as provided by Item 520.  Any electronic device that has been adapted for weighing that meets the calibration requirement is acceptable.  As loads are delivered, loading tickets shall be furnished to the COR.  VI.  PAYMENT:  Payment for furnishing, delivering, weighing, and testing embankment material in accordance with this Scope of Work and measured as provided under Section IV “Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price per ton for embankment material.  When requesting payment, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer receipted (by USIBWC Inspectors or COR), and certified (by the Contractor) weight tickets for each delivery load of material.  VII.  SAMPLING AND TESTING:  A.  The Contractor shall be responsible for assuring that all embankment material delivered to the job site meets the specified requirements in Section IV “Materials.”  The Contractor shall establish a sampling and testing program to include gradation, plasticity index, and moisture content testing to assure compliance of materials.  Testing of all material shall be in accordance with the following Texas Department of Transportation standard laboratory test procedures:  Moisture Content Tex-103-E, Sieve Analysis	Tex-110-E, and Plasticity Index Tex-106-E.  B.  Frequency of Testing:  The Contractor shall:  (a) test once prior to initial delivery and every two weeks for the duration of the project for gradation and plasticity index (Contractor is to notify the COR at least three (3) days prior to taking samples for gradations and plasticity index); and (b) tests for moisture content at least once each delivery day.  The Contractor may test more frequently for gradation and plasticity index to assure material complies with the Scope of Work.  C.  Inspection:  Embankment material the Contractor proposes to furnish shall be available for inspection by the COR.  All sources or stockpiles the Contractor uses to supply materials for the contract shall be subject to inspection and approval by the COR for the duration of the contract.  D.  Government Testing:  The Government will be randomly testing materials throughout the duration of the project to verify that materials being delivered to the job site by the Contractor meet the specified requirements in Section IV “Materials.”  Any materials found to be noncompliant shall be subject to removal by Contractor’s forces and shall be subject to nonpayment.  Government will review noncompliant material and final determination on action to be taken shall be made by the Contracting Officer.  Removal of noncompliant material by Contractor shall be done within 24 hours of notice from CO.  VIII.  SUBMITTALS:  A.  The Contractor shall submit, within five (5) calendar days after receipt of Notice of Award, the source for embankment material proposed for use.  B.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
(ii)  Solicitation IBM07Q0008 is being issued in a Request for Quotes format.  
(iii)  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-15.  
(iv)  IBM07Q0008 is based upon unrestricted competition - offers will be accepted from all responsible sources.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 212321 for construction san and gravel mining, with a corresponding small business size standard of 500 employees.  All offerors must disclose their appropriate size standard in the submitted quotation(s) in order for the quotation to be considered responsive to this solicitation.  
(v) Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001, Flexible Base Material, Estimated Quantity 24,000 tons, Unit Price and Total Cost are to be shown in proposals responding to this solicitation.  Unit prices quoted shall be per ton and include hauling.  All material furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in the scope of work.  
(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK (SOW):  I.  PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many Texas cities including El Paso, Presidio, McAllen-Mission, Harlingen, and Brownsville.  FEMA decertification of USIBWC levees in El Paso County, TX, in February 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  The USIBWC plans on raising approximately 8 miles of USIBWC levees, within a 12 mile reach between International Dam and Riverside Dam in the Rectification Project within El Paso County to meet the minimum 3 feet of freeboard criteria.  This will enable USIBWC to partially certify this reach in the before the end of calendar year 2007.  Because the levees serve as access and maintenance roads along the floodplain and given that the embankment material required for raising the levees does not provide a durable driving surface, a proper surfacing material must placed on the levees in areas where they will be raised.  II.  DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 24,000 tons of flexible base material to be delivered on USIBWC’s levees between International Dam and Riverside Dam.  This material will be used as surfacing material for USIBWC levees.  All materials furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in this Scope of Work.  The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.  III.  PROJECT LOCATION:  The Rio Grande Rectification Project is located along the Rio Grande in El Paso and Hudspeth Counties.  For this Scope of Work, material will only be delivered on USIBWC levees in El Paso County.  Locations of these levees are shown on maps available from USIBC upon request.  IV.  MATERIALS:  The Contractor shall provide flexible base materials in accordance with the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 247 Flexible Base, Type A Grade 6.  Physical Requirements:  Type A – Material shall be crushed stone.  Grade 6:  Grading Requirements are U.S. Standard Sieve Size 1” Percent Retained 0; U.S. Standard Sieve Size ¾” Percent Retained 0-15; U.S. Standard Sieve Size No. 4 Percent Retained 45-75; U.S. Standard Sieve Size No. 40 Percent Retained 60-85;  Max Liquid Limit	40; and Max Plasticity Index	12.  V.  MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS:  Measurement will be by the ton of 2,000 pounds dry weight in vehicles.  The Contractor shall provide a standard platform truck scale conforming to the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 520 “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.”  The dry weight will be determined by deducting the weight of the moisture in the material at the time of weighing from the gross weight of the material.  The moisture in the material will be determined in accordance with Test Method Tex 103-E at least once each day.  Prior to first delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officers’ Representative (COR), a written report of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of Item 520.  When inaccuracy or inadequacy is discovered, scale use will not be resumed until corrective measure has been completed and/or the scales calibrated as provided by Item 520.  Any electronic device that has been adapted for weighing that meets the calibration requirement is acceptable.  As loads are delivered, certified weight tickets for each delivery load shall be furnished to the COR.  VI.  PAYMENT:  Payment for furnishing, delivering, weighing, and testing flexible base material in accordance with this Scope of Work and measured as provided under Section IV “Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price per ton bid price.  When requesting payment, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer receipted (by USIBWC Inspectors) and certified (by the Contractor) weight tickets for each delivery load of flexible base material.  VII.  SAMPLING AND TESTING:  A.  The Contractor shall be responsible for assuring that all flexible base material delivered to the job site meets the specified requirements in Section III “Materials.”  The Contractor shall establish a sampling and testing program to include gradation, liquid limit, plasticity index, and moisture content testing to assure compliance of materials.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to  award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Clause 6.302-1(c) with Hispanic Associates of Colleges and Universities, 8415 DataPoint Dr, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78229 for  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to participate in the Hispanic Associates of Colleges and Universities National Internship program for the period of June 1 through August 31,2007.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the Hispanic community.  Presently NARA?s Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, Hispanics comprise only 1.5 percent of NARA?s workforce, as compared to 7.4 percent of the Federal workforce and 10.7 percent of the total civilian labor force.  Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed Federal agencies to look to alternative sources for Hispanic applicants.  

The supplies and services to be provided are commercial within the meaning of FAR Clause 52.212.1. This statutory authority for other than full and open competition is USC 2304 (c) (1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies who can provide the above listed proprietary items must indicate their interest on or before 04/23/2007 by FAX at (301) 837-3227.  Oral communications are not acceptable. No quotation/proposal received in response to this notice shall be considered since this synopsis cannot be considered a Request for Quotation/proposal. All responsible sources will be considered for evaluating the determination to issue a sole source contract. The purchase order will be issued on or about May 24, 2006 and will be for a period of  3 months . The NAICS code is 813410 Civic and Social Organization. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. Refer to Note 22 in Fedbizzopps.

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS

1.  Operating environment - Where it will be deployed, sea conditions, etc?

It will be deployed near or in the harbor.  Sea conditions vary from large, rolling waves to 2-3 ft. high waves in the harbor.

2.   Support equipment - Will you be deploying from shore or from vessels? Do you have cranes available on the shore or the vessels?

We will be deploying from shore.  We do have cranes and large harbor forklifts available on shore.

3.    Draft - What is the depth of water where you would be working if there was a spill?

Draft is from several feet to very deep.

4.   Oil - what type of oils do you handle and may need to recover?

Bunker C, frying grease, motor oils, diesel/JP8, and gasoline.

5.   Power – Is there a requirement for a hydraulic power unit?

There is no need for a hydraulic power unit as the hydraulic power system from a heavy equipment will power it such as from a tractor or bobcat.  All we need is the hydraulic fittings to fit them, i.e. intake and outlet spring pressure-loaded relief valves.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 300 TO 400 TON SUPERSTRUCTURE HYDRAULIC CRANE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional guidance on the question and answer provided in amendment 1. Amendment 1 stated: Question: The requirement addresses compliance with ASME B.30.5. In the case of the Grove, Terex and the Liebherr Cranes we do not comply with ASME B.30.5. These units are manufactured in Europe and as such ASME B.30.5 is not the governing requirement. The CE uses a DIN / ISO standard which is comparable to the U.S. ASME B30.5.  I request that the specifications be changed to allow either ASME B30.5 or the CE equivalent. Answer: ANSI/ASME B30.5 is our governing document.  We can not remove the requirement for a certificate of compliance that states that the crane meets all those requirements.  If the DIN/ISO standards are comparable then it should not be a problem for the CE to provide a certificate of compliance to ANSI/ASME B30.5.  AMENDMENT 2 GUIDANCE: The vendor shall provide a signed certificate of compliance from the manufacturer stating that the standards they manufacture to meet or exceed the requirements of ANSI/ASME B30.5.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 5, 2007.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

Are you speaking about the visual impairments associated with the blast and brain injuries that the VA would be seeing in these inpatient settings or are you referring to an individual with a visual impairment who might be seen in your Blind VA programs?"&#160; In response, the following is offered as clarification:&#160; In the background, it refers to the visual impairment that would be seen in combination with other conditions such as TBI.&#160; These patients would be seen at the Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center (PRC) first, not at a Blind Rehabilitation Center (BRC).&#160; Therefore the contractor needs to look at the overall rehabilitation that takes place at the PRC.&#160; However, when appropriate the PRC may transition a patient to the BRC for continued rehabilitation for their visual impairment.&#160; For these instances the contractor needs to look at the transition process to see that it follows the appropriate directives.&#160; Firms may fax their quotations to (202) 273-7448 or e-mail to Phyllis.Jackson@va.gov and Priscilla.Lee@va.gov
