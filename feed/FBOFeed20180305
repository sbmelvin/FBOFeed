In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer James Headington, 405-734-1984, james.headington.1@us.af.mil

<DESC>This requirement is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The solicitation will be available for review on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). Potential offerors are encouraged to submit offers via email to the address listed on the solicitation. Therefore IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception: (i)	Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized. Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically. The solicitation number for this requirement will be: SPRTA1-18-Q-0237.

<DESC>This is a PRESOLICITATION NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br /><br />
<p>The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch Systems Enterprise Directorate (LE) intends to execute a sole-source contract action with ManTech SRS Technologies, Inc. (ManTech), for Falcon Heavy Launch System(s) Certification Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) services. This SE&amp;I service includes review of all of the corresponding processes and standards used in engineering, manufacturing, testing, and operations in the Launch Service Provider's facility, and at each of the launch sites located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida; Los Angeles and Vandenberg Air Force Bases in California.  This effort also requires expertise in data and risk management, systems engineering, program management, manufacturing engineering, quality engineering, logistics support, system security, information assurance, and mission integration in support of New Entrant Certification for the Launch Enterprise.</p>
<p>The effort is a follow-on to the Program of Record (PoR) SE&amp;I contract because market research indicated that an award to a contractor other than ManTech would create substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The acquisition described herein will be a sole-source procurement conducted in accordance with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract award will be Cost-Plus Fixed Fee with a period of performance from contract award to March 2020.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal and it does not restrict the SMC/LE as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Any response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>This notice expires fifteen days after the first day of publication of this notice.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />All communications associated with this request shall be submitted via email to the primary and secondary Points of Contact (listed above).</p>

<DESC><p>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of Maritime and NATO Airborne Early Warning (NAEW) Interfaces and Associated Communications Systems Ship-Shore-Ship Buffer (SSSB) for Poland. The SSSB-POL project will allow data and voice communications between the Polish Control and Reporting Centers (CRC) and vessels deployed in the Baltic Sea area.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) hold an active SECRET level facility security clearance, 3) be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 4) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The scope of this bid will encompass the procurement and installation of the Electronic Portion comprising the radio communication, antennas, inter-site link equipment, etc., of the SSSB-POL project. This includes some limited civil works portions associated with those elements. The major civil works portion has been performed previously by Poland through national competitive bidding and are out of the scope of this bid. Completed civil works include, buildings, site perimeters, and associated facilities to host and operate the SSSB Electronic Portion of the project.</p>
<p>The contract resulting from the IFB will be a single Firm Fixed Price contract with an expected completion date of approximately 17 months. The contract will be awarded to the bidder submitting the lowest priced technically compliant bid. The NCI Agency intends to place a single contract with one contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>Execution of the proposed contract will require unescorted access and work of contractor personnel at NATO Class-II security areas. Personnel will be required to hold individual NATO SECRET security clearances. Only companies maintaining the appropriate clearances will be able to perform the resulting contract. The contractor is responsible for obtaining from DOD all NATO clearance certifications.</p>
<p>Prospective bidders will be invited to participate in a Bidders' Conference and Site Survey. The exact dates and agenda for these events will be announced closer to the date. Therefore, and in order to be eligible to attend the Site Survey in Poland, the bidders are kindly reminded to take timely actions to have a valid security clearance of a minimum of NATO SECRET. Information regarding, the official Request for Visit for the Bidders Conference and Site Surveys will be issued through the appropriate channels upon release of the IFB.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />1. Background<br /><br />The Project "Provide Maritime and NATO Airborne Early Warning (NAEW) Interfaces and Associated Communications Systems, Ship-Shore-Ship Buffer (SSSB), for Poland". This project also known as the "SSSB-POL" project, allows data and voice communications between the Polish Control and Reporting Centres (CRC) and vessels deployed in the Baltic Sea area. <br /><br />To achieve this communications capability, two major structures are planned to be established at the Northern coast of Poland to facilitate the TransmiUReceive capability of Link-1, Link-11 B, Link-11 and Link-22 data links and voice signals. Those facilities near the Baltic Sea coast, located at Rzucewo and Rozewie, will be connected to the Polish Command and Control (C2) systems via a SSSB data buffer centre at the Maritime Operations Centre (MOC) in Gdynia, in order to make the required capabilities and data available to the Polish operators.<br /><br />2. Operational Objective<br /><br />Ship-Shore-Ship Buffer (SSSB) is a communication system supporting NATO Command and Control (NATO C2) and is a critical component of the NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence System (NATINAMDS). It enables air surveillance and C2 data and voice to be exchanged between NA TO Air and Maritime forces, NATO Air Defence Ground Environment (NADGE) sites and Maritime HQs ashore. SSSB provides a tactical interface between land and maritime elements to exchange air surveillance information in real-time via existing NATO Data Links (including Link-1, Link-11 B, Link-11 and Link-22). <br /><br />Communications are crucial for the successful execution of Air, Maritime and Land Operations and for the co-ordination between Air, Land and Sea assets. A comprehensive communications capability is required to link airborne, ground-based forces and maritime forces, through SSSB, and provide the appropriate interfaces with strategic, operational and component levels of the NA TO Command Structure. <br /><br />The purpose of implementing the SSSB system in Poland is to provide a data exchange network Link-11/TADIL-A (Tactical Digital Information Link -A) and Link-22 without degradation of the information content, in accordance with applicable STANAG and MIL Standards. <br /><br />The integration of the two radio sites at Rzucewo and Rozewie, connected to the SSSB buffer centre at the MOC in Gdynia shall allow air and naval surveillance in the High-Frequency and Ultra-High-Frequency (HF/UHF) ranges with data Link-11/Link-22 modes and voice modes. Monitoring and control of communication resources will be performed via the SSSB buffer centre at the MOC.</p>
<p>3. Contract Scope of Work Description<br /><br />The scope of this IFS includes the procurement, installation, integration with C2 systems and testing of the SSSB Electronic Portion and ancillary equipment of the two radio sites (at Rzucewo and Rozewie) including minor associated Civil Works and the inter-site communication subsystem. The terrestrial National Defence Network (NON) links, between Rzucewo, Rozewie and the MOC Gdynia are not part of the project scope. <br /><br />This project encompasses the implementation of the Electronic Portion of the SSSB-related aspects of project serial 2000/5Wl15001 under Capability Package 5A 0035, and can be divided into the following subsystems: <br /><br />Radio Communications Sub-system: <br />To be installed at the Receive (RX) and Transmit (TX) radio sites Rzucewo and Rozewie and dedicated to the Ship-Shore-Ship communication in HF (Beyond Line&shy;Of-Sight) and in UHF (Line-Of-Sight) in the Link-11 and Link-22 modes for the data exchange and in voice mode for the operators' co-ordination, using Contractor&shy;provided as well as Purchaser-provided (PFE) elements, including associated training and testing activities. <br />Inter-site Communications Sub-system: <br />Distributed subsystem dedicated to the connection between RX, TX and Buffer Centre, incl. interfacing to the National Defence Network (NON) of Poland, and the implementation of a dedicated Digital Line-Of-Sight (DLOS) inter-site link between the two radio sites. <br /><br />Infrastructure Sub-system: <br />Provided at the radio sites to enable site operations. Major Civil Works are the responsibility of the Host Nation (Poland) and are already accomplished, encompassing major elements like buildings, supporting Non-CIS subsystems and site perimeters. Minor Civil Works are associated to CIS equipment and shall be responsibility of the prospective Contractor, including but not limited to the implementation of the HF and UHF antennas, associated foundation and ducting works, inter-site communications sub-systems, and augmented Power Supply capabilities, as required. <br /><br />The Command and Control system to be installed at the MOC Gdynia is not part of the scope of this project, and will be implemented by the NCI Agency's AMDC2 SSSB Cell, for the purpose of:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>Remote-management of the radio subsystems</li>
<li>Translation of the Link-11 /Link-22 protocol into Link-1 and Link-11 B in accordance with STANAG 5511, STANAG 5601, etc.</li>
<li>Presentation of the Air, Surface and Subsurface tactical picture</li>
<li>Management of the Voice co-ordination of the Link-11/Link-22 data link</li>
<li>Provide secure data encryption of Link-11/Link-22 (Communication Security, COMSEC)</li>
<li>Monitoring of the correct operations of infrastructure and equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID<br /><br />NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 26 March 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): Q1 2018</p>
<p>- Bid Closing: TBD</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): Q1 2019</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /> <br />Title:  Metabolic Epidemiology Branch Support Services<br /> <br />The Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodologic studies, specialized tasks in large scale studies, full scale support for cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span></p>
<p>A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within MEB focus on the role of nutrition, energy balance, hormones, and metabolism in cancer etiology through population-based epidemiologic studies.  MEB research relies heavily on large prospective cohort studies, but the portfolio includes targeted case-control, cross-sectional, and case series analyses as needed.  These studies are carried out in environments that are optimal for achieving scientific goals and may include special high-risk populations.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, MEB's approach has been to (1) integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers into interdisciplinary molecular epidemiologic investigations to understand a variety of exposures as related to multiple cancers and gain insights into mechanisms that mediate risk factors; (2) sub-divide tumors into etiologically and prognostically distinct entities; (3) examine natural history of and progression for cancer precursors; (4) address rapidly emerging issues in cancer epidemiology through novel investigations of poorly understood risk factors and under-studied cancers; and (5) assist in training the next generation of molecular epidemiologists.</p>
<p>The philosophical focus of MEB research is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and to investigate the roles of diet, body size, and physical activity and their mechanisms of action including intermediate biologic markers.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in MEB research. Approximately twenty-eight studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirement</span></p>
<p>This support services contract is essential for MEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/MEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining exposures to identify new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk.  Thus, the support services contractor will need to provide staff with high quality logistical skills, knowledge of epidemiological studies and diverse biological specimens, and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance.  The contractor will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, pilot, and feasibility) studies.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the activities described in the attached <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft</span> Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201300016C held by Westat, Inc.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that one contract may be awarded beginning on or about December 31, 2018.  The anticipated period of performance is January 1, 2019 - August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Plan Performance Assessment Services
<SOLNBR>24322618R0013
<CONTACT>Cheryl D Allen, Phone 202.606.2054 , Fax 202.606.1464, Email Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Employee Insurance Operations (FEIO) administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program for eligible Federal employees and annuitants, other statutorily eligible individuals, and their eligible family members. The FEHB Program covers approximately 8.3 million lives and provides about $53 billion a year in healthcare benefits.
<p>OPM aims to improve the health of the populations we serve, ensure the delivery of high quality consumer focused health care, and provide Federal employees, annuitants, and other statutorily eligible individuals with affordable insurance benefits. To reward quality care, OPM evaluates FEHB carriers on key parameters of clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and contract oversight through the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment. Many aspects of the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment framework rely on measures from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS).</p>
<p>Scoring measures against national benchmarks helps OPM recognize top plans in the program, inform enrollee choice, and link objective performance to profit factors. In addition, the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment aligns OPM required health plan measures with other major systems of measurement, without creating a disparate set of measures unique to the FEHB Program.</p>
<p>OPM has collected FEHB Carrier HEDIS and CAHPS measures for many years. The first year of FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment scoring was in 2016. For 2017, we added an Improvement Increment to the Clinical Quality, Customer Service and Resource Use (QCR) score. FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment guidance and instructions are issued to FEHB Carriers via Carrier Letters which are available on the OPM website at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/carriers/#url=Archive.</p>
<p>OPM seeks technical expertise and data systems capabilities to collect, calculate, aggregate, and report measurement data related to the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment. The additional services provided under the proposed contract will streamline data reporting and analyses, expand the capacity of OPM to utilize a broader range of relevant measures along with appropriate benchmarks or reference ranges, and strengthen the integrity of the performance calculation process. The required expertise to perform these specific services includes healthcare analytical system proficiencies, as well as subject matter expertise in healthcare measure development, evaluation, and reporting. The successful offeror must demonstrate detailed evidence of their experience in the areas of clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and quality assurance evaluation, as well as health plan efficiency measurement. Due to the technical nature of this project, extensive experience in the details of measure auditing and reporting is required, including but not limited to the NCQA HEDIS Audit and the CAHPS Survey. Having provided a similar scope of data evaluation and aggregation services to large commercial or government entities is highly desirable. In addition to the technical expertise described above, OPM is seeking a collaborator with the vision and capability to help refine the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment methodology as new measures are added and trends are elucidated.</p>
<p>OPM has published the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment methodology and reporting instructions through a series of Carrier Letters. The offeror is expected to be familiar with published OPM materials, including material provided at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/carriers/#url=Performance-Assessment.</p>
<p>We will procure the proposed acquisition using full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 15. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which we will consider.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be firm-fixed-price. The performance period for the proposed contract is expected to be five years: a one-year base period and four one-year options.</p>
<p>OPM intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) on or about March 12, 2018. The RFP and all documents relating to this requirement will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website for release of the RFP and all other documents relating to this requirement. We encourage interested parties to register on the FBO website for e-mail notification of all actions relating to the RFP and for the interested vendors list. After we release the RFP, we will give interested parties the opportunity to ask questions. We will include all questions and answers in an amendment to the RFP and post the amendment on the FBO web site.</p>
<p>Proposals will be due on or about April 11, 2018. We anticipate awarding the proposed contract by July 31, 2018.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement. Therefore, there is no incumbent.</p>

<p>1. Site Restoration</p>
<p>The mission of the Site Restoration program is to provide integration, planning and analysis for all soil and groundwater remediation, deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) and facility engineering. The Site Restoration subprograms and their objectives follow: <br /><br />Soil and Groundwater <br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the largest groundwater and soil remediation effort in the world. The inventory at the DOE sites includes 6.5 trillion liters of contaminated groundwater, an amount equal to about four times the daily U.S. water consumption, and 40 million cubic meters of soil and debris contaminated with radionuclides, metals, and organics. At the large sites such as Hanford (Richland, WA), Savannah River (Aiken, SC), and Oak Ridge (Oak Ridge, TN), the Office of Technology Development conducts research and demonstration projects to test new technologies and remediation approaches. These initiatives are developing remediation alternatives ranging from active engineered systems to passive methods such as natural attenuation to address a variety of DOE&#8208;EM contaminants. They are being integrated into a systems&#8208;based, risk&#8208;informed, remediation framework that is being applied across the DOE&#8208;EM complex. <br />R&amp;D can include characterization and monitoring; stabilization, remediation and processing; and modeling, visualization and analysis. The goal of research and technology development activities is to deliver approaches and technologies from highly leveraged and strategic investments that maximize the reduction of risk and life&#8208;cycle cleanup costs.</p>
<p>Sub&#8208;Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Attenuation Based Remedies for the Subsurface <br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to solutions to address subsurface metal and radionuclide contamination and recalcitrant organics in particular, iodine, chromium, cesium TCE, and uranium.<br />C1: Research should complement or extend the work.</p>
<p>PA2: Deep Vadose Zone <br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to improved characterization, remediation, monitoring, and prediction for the deep vadose zone <br />C2: Research should complement or extend the work funded at Richland and address those issues related to uranium, iodine, and chromium.</p>
<p>PA3: Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants <br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the control of the flux of contaminants in soil and water environments <br />C3: Research should complement or extend the work of the Mercury Initiative based at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that focuses on protecting surface water, groundwater, and ecological receptors. The Oak Ridge Mercury Strategy can be found at https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/05/f32/2016%2C%20Technology%20Plan%20to%20Address%20Mercury.pdf.</p>
<p>PA4: Monitoring at Environmental Remediation Sites<br />PA4: Across the DOE Complex the long-term monitoring of subsurface contamination that is left in the ground to be naturally attenuated and/or bioremediated requires new approaches, sensors and data analysis to ensure the safety and health of the environment. For additional information please visit https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications /external/technical reports/PNNL-21379.pdf.</p>
<p>Deactivation &amp; Decommissioning <br />Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) is the process of taking an active/excess/abandoned facility to a final disposition end state. Because of residual radioactivity, other hazardous constituents, and the physical condition of EM's facilities, D&amp;D presents unique hazards that must be addressed from a safety, programmatic, environmental, and technological standpoint. The general D&amp;D process applies to all facilities across the EM complex. The D&amp;D function with the Office of Infrastructure and D&amp;D focusses on innovative applications and timely insertion of existing commercially available technologies, processes and hardware to identify and address D&amp;D risks and challenges. In cases where appropriate technologies do not exist or do not exist at the required level of maturity, the Office supports the research and development (R&amp;D) to increase the technology maturation. The program supports the development of informed facility D&amp;D strategy such as In&#8208;Situ Decommissioning (entombment), enhanced verifiability of the efficacy of D&amp;D operations, increased productivity and personnel safety of D&amp;D operation, facilitation of acceptable facility end&#8208;states, and independent verification.</p>
<p>Sub&#8208;Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):<br /><br />PA1: Unique sensor networks for remote monitoring of entombed facilities and tanks <br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to the development and deployment of these networks <br />C1: Research should extend techniques already developed at DOE labs</p>
<p>PA2: Interactions between radiological and chemical contaminants of concern to DOE (e.g. plutonium, cesium, mercury, etc.) and facility materials (e.g. concrete, steel, nickel, etc.) <br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to a better scientific understanding of these interactions <br />C2: Scientific understanding should support the subsequent development of cost effective methods to decontaminate facility materials</p>
<p>PA3: Incombustible fixatives and decontamination agents <br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the development of these fixatives and agents <br />C3: (None specified)</p>
<p>PA4: Acceptability of various decontamination and fixative agents mixtures <br />RN4: Testing protocols to demonstrate the acceptance <br />C4: Protocols should be applicable to various DOE facilities</p>
<p>PA5: Robotics and remote systems with plug&#8208;and&#8208;play interchangeable components <br />RN5: There are a number of areas where advancements in robotics will benefit the DOE Environmental management mission. Research in any of the areas described below will be considered. R&amp;D leading to advances in the development of multi-use robots and remote systems ranging from simple tele-operated units to fully autonomous systems applicable to DOE Environmental Management tasks including D&amp;D is the objective. R&amp;D targeting sensors which can be deployed on mobile platforms is also a prime area of interest. Sensors of concern include devices to characterize the condition of inaccessible nuclear facilities like concrete structures such as gamma scanning, UT, IR, GPR, laser mapping, etc. Wearable robotics to enhance worker capability and safety is another category suitable for research. The DOE complex has numerous gloveboxes in which operators work through rubber gloves. R&amp;D into tele-operated manipulators that can be deployed through existing gloves and requires no modification to the existing infrastructure would be beneficial. https://energy.gov/em/office-environmental-management<br />C5: Research should support component development with application to DOE nuclear facilities. Devices developed for DOE nuclear facilities must be rugged and able to operate in radioactive environments ranging from low to highly radioactive. Developers should consider the facilities to be an industrial setting with the objective to execute tasks that are dirty (contaminated), dull (routine, repetitive), dangerous (occupational hazards), and difficult (requires engineered measures).</p>
<p><br />PA6: Models for facility decommissioning <br />RN6: R&amp;D leading to model development <br />C6: Research could include modeling of degradation and its effects on decommissioning scope and costs</p>
<p>PA7: Enhanced Characterization and Real Time Monitoring Technologies <br />RN7: R&amp;D Leading to improved field deployable instrumentation; with increased detection limits and precision and accuracy for both radiological and chemical contaminants<br />C7: Research could include development of a real time, field deployable asbestos characterization/quantification instrument and fixed radiation monitors with automatic shift in the direction of prevailing and changing winds</p>
<p><br />2. Tank Waste</p>
<p>EM is dedicated to safely disposing of waste and seeks cost effective and environmentally responsible project execution methods. EM offices that focus on waste management provide leadership in planning and executing EM programs for the storage, retrieval, pretreatment, treatment, and final preparation of nuclear materials for disposal and tank closure planning.</p>
<p>Tank Waste and Waste Processing <br />The Department has approximately 88 million gallons of liquid waste stored in underground tanks and approximately 4,000 cubic meters of solid waste derived from the liquids stored in bins. The current DOE estimated cost for retrieval, treatment and disposal of this waste exceeds $50 billion to be spent over several decades. The highly radioactive portion of this waste, located at the Hanford Site, Idaho National Laboratory, and Savannah River Site, must be treated, immobilized, and prepared for shipment to a waste repository. Efforts currently focus on improving pre&#8208;treatment to reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed, retrieval technologies, vitrification performance, and breakthrough immobilization technologies.</p>
<p>Sub&#8208;Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Current DOE tank waste and waste processing approaches <br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to the development of technology improvements that address technology gaps or optimize the current DOE flow sheets <br />C1: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Characterization of Physical and Chemical Properties; Improvement in Slurry Transport, Mixing, and Flammability Control; Refining the Separations Processes; and Optimizing Processing Facilities and Waste Forms</p>
<p>PA2: Alternative DOE tank waste processing options <br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to addressing challenges to alternative processes, to eliminate the need for new massive facilities, to start waste treatment operations sooner, and to accelerate reduction of hazards from materials stored in tanks <br />C2: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Development of Alternative Separations Methods and Deployment Strategies, Development of Alternative Waste Forms and Processes</p>
<p>PA3: Tank Management and Closure <br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to improved tank integrity, and water intrusion detection and leak detection. <br />Closure objectives include achieving retrieval goals, developing protocols for residual waste characterization and immobilization, establishing barriers to release of constituents of interest, and development of closure materials <br />C3: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Improvement in tank leak and intrusion detection and mitigation; improvement in in situ sampling, analysis, characterization, and monitoring for tank closure; development of retrieval method alternatives (mechanical and chemical); and improvement in the technical basis for closure and performance assessments.</p>

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is seeking partners interested in developing competitive proposals in response to NASA Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), Missions of Opportunities (MoOs) and proposal calls from other government agencies. ARC is interested in identifying potential partners that can perform science investigations, research activities, and develop and demonstrate new technologies that are aligned with NASA's goals. Information is also sought on regarding partners that, in addition to performing substantial research, can provide flight hardware (i.e. spacecraft, deployment systems, suborbital systems, ground support systems, equipment, or instrumentation) necessary to implement proposed science investigations, research activities or technology demonstration missions.
<p>As background, NASA often competitively selects scientific investigations, technology development and demonstration missions through solicitations or announcements posted on NSPIRES http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external. These missions are typically led by a single Principal Investigator (PI), Principle Technologist (PT), or Project Manager (PM). The PI, PT, or PM may be from Government or non-Government institutions, including academic institutions, industry or nonprofit entities, from one of NASA's nine field Centers, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), other federally funded research and development centers, or other U.S. Government agencies. Mission teams may be formed from any combination of these institutions including international partners. ARC may respond to an AO or other proposal calls in either a lead or supporting role.</p>
<p>This synopsis/special notice is posted annually in anticipation of upcoming AOs, and may have subsequent specific updates as ARC seeks partners for specific proposal opportunities. ARC is currently considering responding to AOs from NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Human Exploration and Operations Missions Directorate (HEOMD), and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD).</p>
<p>A full description of calls for proposals from the Science Mission and Space Technology Mission Directorates at NASA Headquarters can be found at http://nasa.gov or http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external. Additional information is available at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers. For the 2017 and anticipated 2018 calls for proposals, Ames is most interested in the following opportunities: (See websites for further information)</p>

<p>JOINT ASSAULT BRIDGE (JAB) Max Rate Production</p>
<p>The Government plans to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) modification to the current FFP eight year JAB production Contract W56HZV- 16-C-0028 awarded on a competitive basis to DRS SUSTAINMENT SYSTEMS, INC. (DRS) on 11 May 2016.</p>
<p>The XM1074 JAB program is an Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) Joint Interest Program that will replace the legacy M48/M60 tank-based Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) and Wolverine systems. The JAB system will be a fully-tracked armored combat engineer vehicle specifically designed to provide Armored Brigade Combat Teams assault bridging capabilities to support maneuver elements. Using the M1A1 Abrams chassis as the basis for the system, the JAB will provide equivalent crew protection and vehicle survivability, while having the necessary speed and cross country mobility to keep pace with maneuver forces. The JAB will launch and recover the Army's existing hydraulically-actuated AVLB Military Load Class (MLC) 85 scissor bridge. The contractor will integrate an industry-designed hydraulic Bridge Launcher Mechanism (BLM) onto a modified M1A1 chassis to launch the existing AVLB MLC-85 scissor bridge.</p>
<p>Product Manager Bridging (PdM) Bridging is seeking to expand the maximum annual production ceilings in the current JAB Contract in order to provide buying flexibility to the Army. PdM Bridging will pursue a contract modification with DRS to revise the current range pricing on the subject contract by increasing the option ceilings in FY 19- 23 to a potential max of 75 JABS, thereby speeding up production and potentially fulfilling the AAO of all 365 JAB systems (337 Army and 28 USMC) under the current contract W56HZV-16-C-0028.<br />Disclaimer: This is a sources sought notice and is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the information contained in this posting or information received as a result of this posting. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which the agency will consider.</p>

<SOLNBR>RFI-2018-RapidIV
<RESPDATE>040418
<CONTACT>Leslie Adams, Contracting Officer, Phone 3012867241, Email Leslie.M.Adams@nasa.gov
<DESC><br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutes (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition (Rapid IV) catalog follow-on contracts to procure spacecraft designs that comply with mission requirements.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based responses hereto.<br /><br />
<p>The Rapid IV acquisition is intended to result in the award of multiple fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for spacecraft bus core systems that would be used to meet the Government's science and technology needs. Under the Rapid IV process, contracts are awarded to vendors based on their ability to meet specific criteria (i.e. the ability to execute the Statement of Work (SOW); and provide a "heritage" spacecraft, which has successfully completed on-orbit checkout and acceptance). Vendors would submit core spacecraft designs that could be successfully modified as carriers for one or more flight instrument payloads. Each core spacecraft system would need to supply all necessary design, fabrication, assembly, test, flight payload instrument integration and test, final observatory (spacecraft plus payload) integration and test, shipping, launch support, on-orbit check-out and operations support. Operations support would include all required ground support equipment as well as associated flight and ground based software and software maintenance for the spacecraft offered.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information, comments, and suggestions from spacecraft manufacturers regarding:</p>
<p>- Interest in supplying spacecraft under the new Rapid IV contract</p>
<p>- Estimated number and types of potential spacecraft offerings</p>
<p>- Comments on the current Rapid III contract, if any</p>
<p>- Suggestions for the Rapid IV contract, if any</p>
<p>Responses must include at a minimum the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone and Historically Black Colleges and Universities)/Minority Institutions; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).</p>
<p>The information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will be considered in the development of the terms and conditions of the upcoming solicitation. GSFC welcomes any information submitted by interested parties in response to this request.</p>
<p>The Rapid IV contracts serves as a fast and flexible Government-wide, firm fixed price (FFP), IDIQ procurement tool for flight proven spacecraft or spacecraft components.</p>
<p>The Rapid IV contracts are managed by the Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO). The RSDO also facilitates mission-specific spacecraft procurements for government customers via the Rapid IV contract. The purpose of the Rapid IV concept is to reduce overall procurement-lead time, as well as reduce mission implementation cost and risk by leveraging flight proven spacecraft designs.</p>
<p>The spacecrafts under contract are placed in the Rapid IV "catalog" for potential procurement via IDIQ delivery orders for mission customers. These mission-specific delivery orders are competed amongst the Rapid IV contractors and awarded based on the contractor's ability to satisfy the customer's mission requirements. Modifications to the core spacecraft to meet the specific requirements of future missions are normal and expected.</p>
<p>It is expected for the Rapid IV contracts to include an "On Ramp" feature, which allows for the catalog to be refreshed in order to give new vendors the opportunity to propose flight proven spacecraft designs. On Ramps also give vendors already awarded an RSA contract the opportunity to propose additional flight proven spacecraft designs and/or update their existing catalog designs.</p>
<p>The Rapid IV acquisition is anticipated to be procured under Far Part 15.  As opposed to the current Rapid III contracts, NASA/GSFC does not anticipate that the Rapid IV contract will include the NASA/GSFC Mission Assurance Requirements (MAR) at the Master contract level.  The anticipated minimum quality management standard may be SAE AS9100/ISO 9001.  The Rapid IV contracts will have a Base Period of Performance of five (5) years; however, it is anticipated that the Rapid IV contracts will also have an option to extend for an additional five (5) years, for a total of ten (10) years. Those companies not familiar with Rapid III contracts are welcome to visit the RSDO website: http://rsdo.gsfc.nasa.gov for background information. Specifically, review material under "Mission Statement" and "Rapid III" menu tabs.</p>
<p>The range of possible NASA missions is broad in scope, type and size. Therefore, the Rapid IV contracts would seek heritage spacecraft buses of various sizes (e.g., 6U cubesats to geosynchronous spacecraft), capabilities, lifetimes, orbit use and mission suitability, in order to be ready to support a variety of mission needs quickly.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to Leslie Adams via email (in either Microsoft Word or ADOBE PDF format) to the e-mail address listed no later than April 4, 2018 at 4:00 PM EDT. Please reference RFI-2018-Rapid IV in any response.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained from this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Comments and suggestions for improving the requirements documents are always encouraged and solicited.</p>

<p>Government Quality Assurance Plan (QAP):<br />In your role as Contracting Officers Representative (COR), you assume some Quality Assurance duties. You will monitor contractor performance, complete and sign the Quality Assurance Worksheet provided below at least monthly, but you can submit the worksheet more frequently if needed. This worksheet allows you to document compliance with the Contract and fill a regulatory requirement to ensure adequate oversight is being performed. <br />Quality Assurance Plan Worksheets are to be sent directly to the Contracting Officer (CO), not later than the 5th day of the month following the service (every month). At a minimum, the COR must send a completed copy of the worksheet to the CO after the first month of service and for any months where there is a rating other than Green. The CO will assume a quality performance rating of "Green" on all measured deliverables unless otherwise notified. <br />The quality rating may change from "Green" to "Red" without notice, however we encourage the COR to utilize the "Yellow" quality rating to alert the CO of quality issues that have the potential for a "Red" quality rating if corrective action is not taken. <br />Any time the rating is less than Green the COR shall clearly document the worksheet to indicate what did or did not occur per the PWS requirement. When an observation indicates other than a "Green" rating, the COR will require the Contractor to initial the observation. Initialing the observation does not constitute concurrence with the observation; it only acknowledges that they have been made aware of the defective performance. If the Contractor's response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the Contractor to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources capable of providing Explosive Detection Canine Team (EDCT) services for multiple locations throughout New York City, NY. An EDCT is the equivalent of a Detection Dog Handler (Occupation Code 27030) as set forth in the United States Department of Labor (DOL) Directory of Occupations. The information requested by this Sources Sought may be used within the FPS to facilitate acquisition planning and will not be disclosed outside of the Government. <br /><br />EDCT Contractors will be required to provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, files and any other resources necessary to accomplish the EDCT services. The contract will require a Secret level facility security clearance. All personnel supporting the contract will be required to meet FPS training, certification, and suitability standards. The services to be provided will include: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Basic Services</span> - Basic services are the permanent ongoing services specifically included in the task order(s) at time of award, or added through modification up to any established maximums identified in the contract. Basic services will occur primarily at vehicle screening checkpoints on a regularly scheduled basis.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Temporary Additional Services</span> - During the term of the contract, the Government may have requirements for temporary additional services (TAS) beyond the basic services requirements. TAS are the short term, non-recurring needs for service such as an increase in hours to an existing or subsequently added post to include the weekend where a public demonstration is taking place over the weekend, addition of posts to provide for increased security for special events or high profile visitor to the building, extension of existing post hours in a building to cover seasonal fluctuations (such as at an IRS building during tax season), etc. Due to the nature of TAS, the Contractor may be required to perform these services with little advance notice.<br /><br />The training requirements to be provided for all EDCT's working under this effort are as follows:<br /><br />- Contractor-Provided Basic Training (initial - prior to standing post; 64 hours)<br />- Contractor-Provided Refresher Training (recurring - every 3 years; 40 hours)<br />- Government-Provided Orientation Training (initial - prior to standing post; 8 hours)<br />- Contractor-Provided EDCT Certification (In accordance with FPS Directive FPS-05-004, Explosive Detection Dog Canine Program and FPS Directive 15.1.7.1, Vapor Wake Detection Canine Certification) (initial; annual re-certification)<br />- Contractor-Provided EDCT Sustainment Training (In accordance with FPS Directive FPS-05-004, Explosive Detection Dog Canine Program and FPS Directive 15.1.7.1, Vapor Wake Detection Canine Certification) (recurring - minimum 16 hours/month)<br />- First Aid, CPR, AED (in accordance with ARC/AHA requirements)<br />- State/Local Training pertaining to EDCT duties/functions (as required)<br />- Unanticipated Special Training (as required)<br /><br />It is anticipated that services will consist of approximately 3,000.00 hours of basic service, and 1,000.00 hours of temporary additional services on an annual basis. EDCT's provide service at approximately 1-5 facilities location throughout New York City, NY.<br /><br />For purposes of the Sources Sought, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612. If your firm is capable of providing the requirements described in this Sources Sought, please provide capability information using the attached project form via email to Daniel Rapoport (215) 521-2265, Daniel.Rapoport@hq.dhs.gov by 3:00 PM EST Friday, March 9, 2018. In the subject line, please write "Canine Sources Sought" and provide your firm name.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, or an Invitation for Bids. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract for the items contained in the Sources Sought. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this Sources Sought, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examining attorneys conduct searches for conflicting marks as part of the official examination of an application after a trademark application has been filed. In evaluating an application, the examining attorney conducts a search of USPTO records to determine whether there is a conflict between the design mark in the application and a mark that is either already registered or pending in the USPTO. The principal factors considered in reaching this decision are the similarity of the marks and the commercial relationship between the goods and services identified by the marks. <span style="letter-spacing: .65pt;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">To find a conflict, it is not required that the marks and the goods/services be exactly the same; instead, it is sufficient if the marks are similar and the goods and or services are related such that consumers would mistakenly believe they come from the same source.<span style="letter-spacing: .65pt;"> </span>Similarity in sound, appearance, or meaning may be sufficient to support a finding of likelihood of confusion.&nbsp; <span style="letter-spacing: .65pt;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">External customers can also conduct a search prior to submitting an application in order to save time and/or money.&nbsp; While many trademark applicants are represented by legal counsel and/or hired professional search firms who provide advance search reports, over 30% of applicants are pro se (not represented by counsel) and rely on the free, publicly-available USPTO search system to determine if their mark would cause conflict with a previously filed mark.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The search system is also used for many other reasons beyond the likelihood of confusion search.&nbsp; Internal users search for applications featuring common data elements such as examples of marks of various types for use in training materials, and for examples of goods and services that have been accepted by USPTO in the past.&nbsp; Because of the myriad of reasons why a search of USPTO&rsquo;s records could be conducted, maximum flexibility and ease of use in constructing searches while using multiple criteria is essential.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.25in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Currently, USPTO&rsquo;s homegrown X&#8208;Search application is the trademark search system used by internal employees.&nbsp; The Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) is the public-facing version.&nbsp; Both products rely on the same Live Link Discovery Server (LLDS) by Open Text. The LLDS search engine is a viable solution but the frontend applications (i.e. TESS and X&#8208;Search) are redundant and use outdated technologies.</span></p>

As the number of trademark filings increases, the ability of examining attorneys and our customers to review and filter this content is becoming increasingly strained. USPTO is interested in information technology (IT) solutions that can assist in narrowing the broad information base to manageable sizes for more careful individual review by both internal employees who can be given extensive training and external users who may not understand the nuances of searching.

<CONTACT>Wilson, Mary
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Interior, US Geological Survey (USGS) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for the potential need for genetic analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) developed using regionally standardized baseline data sets that are the current recovery program protocols, with species validation and parentage assessment using microsatellite DNA genotyping at 19 loci. Our mission is engaged in cooperative studies to aid in the recovery of the endangered pallid sturgeon. Free-embryo and larval stages of pallid sturgeon are being collected below known spawning sites and at fixed locations on the Yellowstone River.  Collected specimens must be separated from other sympatric species of sturgeons and paddlefish, and identified to species.  In the case of specimens collected at known spawning sites and identified as pallid sturgeon, the DNA of the specimen must be compared to known (previously genotyped) adults to assess parentage and purity. 

The accurate identification of pallid sturgeon larvae and assignment of individual specimens to specific known parents requires complex genetic procedures which include, but are not limited to: DNA isolation, DNA purification, DNA sequencing, microsatellite analysis, and amplification of microsatellite loci via the polymerase chain reaction, automated DNA sequencing, multi-locus genotype data generation, and genotype analysis.  The analysis requires expertise and experience with pallid sturgeon genetics and hybridization with closely related species.  The interpretation of the data requires a readily available standardized baseline data set to perform accurate identification, account for regional variability, and to assign parentage of individuals to known parents.

The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541714.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

 
If your organization has the potential ability to meet this requirement, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. 

The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract.

<DESC>VA James J. Peters VA Medical Center Research Department intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with New York Genome Center, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1; to provide sequencing services in support of their research study  Neuronal Subtype Specific Epigenetic Regulation in Schizophrenia .   

These services must be provided by a qualified vendor within in one hours  drive of the VA facility, due to the nature of the study and perishability samples.  Members of the VA laboratory in the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC), Bronx, NY, will deliver the samples to the Center/Facility. Due to the necessity to maintain temperature control, physical integrity of the samples and chain of custody, transportation of the samples outside this specified radius is infeasible.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Friday, March 9, 2018, 1400 ET.

<DESC>DoD Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is partnering with the C5 Consortium to hold an Industry Day which will be held on Thursday, October 12, 2017 at the JW Marriott in Washington, DC.<br /><br />The purpose of the Industry Day is to identify possible collaboration and business opportunities to modernize DoD Travel. The Department is considering transitioning to a secure, efficient, and effective end-to-end travel solution that includes Travel Management Company (TMC) services supported by travel and expense management technology. This solution must be able to book travel, manage travel related expenses, and initiate travel-related financial transactions. The Department will use an iterative implementation, based on agile processes, to ensure rapid deployment of capability. The first iteration will focus on Temporary Duty (TDY) Business Travel in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), setting the stage for further capability expansion to a broader set of travel requirements.<br />The Department is interested in reducing overhead costs for travel transactions and lowering overall travel cost per trip by empowering travelers to make travel decisions that benefit their organizations. To address overhead costs, the Department seeks to minimize customization, while enhancing flexible configuration of systems by aligning travel policies with standard industry practice, but without negatively affecting usability, auditability, compliance, or security.
<p>The day will be spent reviewing the travel service requirements and the procurement process, answering any questions from vendors that are interested in the opportunity. Following the main presentation (including question and answer opportunity) and lunch, there will be time allotted for one-on-one question and answer sessions. Prior commitment to consortium membership is not required to attend the Industry Day. Prospective offerors, regardless of consortium membership, are encouraged to attend. Interested parties may obtain further details and register regarding the Industry Day from C5 at https://www.regonline.com/C5IndustryDay. Formalized membership to the consortium will be required to respond to the requirement.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals or Request for Quote. It is for planning purposes only. A contract award will not be made from this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide industry with advanced notification of the Government's intent.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACT to Fairbanks North Star Borough. Fort Wainwright is in need of a critical upgrade that will allow Fort Wainwright E911 to connect to the Fairbanks North Star Borough E911 system. This upgrade is crucial to ensure up-to-date emergency information. Fort Wainwright is requiring an Airbus Vesta 911 system that will provide the ability for Fort Wainwright to handle on-post, as well as commercial, housing, and cellular 911 calls transferred from the Fairbanks Emergency communications Center (FECC) with ANI/ALI display. Interconnecting the two 911 systems is mutually beneficial because it allows exchange of enhanced features offered through an NG911 environment including: map imagery, wireless telephone location information, failover support, shared network infrastructure improving the overall 911 service to residents in the Borough and to those who live and work at Fort Wainwright. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between United States Army Garrison Fort Wainwright and Fairbanks North Star Borough for the Interconnection of 911 system was signed Jan 2016. <br />This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals, nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Israeli Lounge International Design Competition
<p>1. Introduction<br /><br />An international competition is being held to obtain a design for the existing Israeli Lounge at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. This space is part of the living memorial to President John F. Kennedy. <br />The competition presents a unique opportunity to reshape and transform an historic space within a Memorial that is visited by millions from around the world annually. <br />It is expected that the new design will highlight the potential and excitement of arts and cultural exchange creating a new image, mood, and artistic experience that showcases and celebrates today's Israeli culture in an innovative and interesting way.<br />The new design shall be a celebration of Jewish culture, including philosophy, the arts, science, and religion; should include both historical and contemporary references; and should be an homage to the country of Israel.<br />2. Location<br /><br />The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts<br />The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the "Kennedy Center"), located on seventeen acres overlooking the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., is America's living memorial to President Kennedy and his vision that the arts and cultural achievement should be an integral part of human experience. The Kennedy Center fulfils this vision and represents not only the dynamic core of Washington's cultural environment, but is America's showcase for the performing arts. It is the nation's busiest performing arts facility: each year the Kennedy Center's nine performance spaces host approximately 2,000 performances for audiences totaling nearly two million. Its diverse offerings include specially priced, low-cost, and free performances, making its programs available to everyone. In addition, more than a million visitors tour the Kennedy Center's public spaces each year, and an additional 20 million attend touring productions or tune in to Kennedy Center-related television or radio broadcasts. The Kennedy Center presents the greatest performers and performances of music, dance, and theater; supports artists in the creation of new work; and serves the nation as a leader in arts education.</p>
<p>The Israeli Lounge <br />The existing Israeli Lounge is located on the Box Tier level of the Concert Hall, in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, and was a gift from the People of Israel. The Concert Hall is the home of the nationally recognized National Symphony Orchestra led by Maestro Gianandrea Noseda, and for concerts, and other performances, this Lounge serves as a space for patrons, donors, guests, and Kennedy Center staff to entertain and host people from around the globe to connect and reflect on an important part of the world. <br />Originally designed by Raphael Blumefield, the space currently features painted ceiling panels by Shraga Weil and a wood wall sculpture by Nechemia Azaz. Photos and commemoratives of former music directors from the NSO adorn the walls of this lounge. Doors midway along the south end of the Lounge serve as sound separation from the activities in the lobbies and the Grand Foyer. There is an integral bar and associated kitchen and pantry. <br />The Lounge space is 59 feet long by 20 feet wide and approximately 20' high. A floor plan and photographs of the Lounge are included on the design competition page on the Kennedy Center website.<br /><br />3. Support<br />Design and construction of the Lounge renovation are being supported by a generous gift from Mikhail Fridman and LetterOne, benefactors to the Kennedy Center. Additional information is available on the design competition page on Kennedy Center website.<br />4. Budget<br />The project budget is $1 million. <br /><br />5. Design Objective<br />The new design shall be a celebration of the country of Israel and Jewish culture, including philosophy, the arts, science, and religion. It should include both historical and contemporary references. <br />The design should take into account the multifunctional purpose of the lounge. During performance intermissions, the Lounge provides a space for Concert Hall patrons to congregate and refresh with snacks and drinks. At other times the space may be used for dinners and should accommodate up to 60 guests. Finally, the space will be available to individual groups and Kennedy Center staff for meetings and presentations. <br />The design shall address all necessary physical infrastructure and include the entry doors and accommodate a maximum occupancy of 78 people. The kitchen and pantry were recently renovated and can be placed outside the scope of this project, unless a reconfiguration of these spaces is included in the concept design to meet the design objective. <br />The lounge's location within a federal Presidential Memorial should be respected and the design should be in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and all other applicable regulations. <br />Specific Design Criteria<br />All designs must work within the existing Lounge footprint. While it may be possible to relocate or adjust the current ingress and egress, it will not be possible to completely move or remove existing walls. Designs should illustrate how the design can be accommodated within the existing space with minimal disruption to structural elements. If applicable, designs should illustrate security requirements and how such requirements can be accommodated.<br />The design should clearly indicate how the concept will be executable within the budget scope while meeting user needs and all cultural factors stipulated above, while considering sustainability and life-cycle costs. <br /><br />6. Competition Rules<br />Eligibility<br />The competition is open to all designers, artists, sculptors and architects. <br />Competitors must be 18 years of age at the time of submission. <br />A competitor may enter the competition as an individual ("Individual") or member of a collaboration ("Team").<br />Officers, members of the Board of Trustees, or employees of the Kennedy Center, their immediate families or others living in the same household and any professional interior or architectural design firms or contractors with which any of the above are affiliated are not eligible to compete. Technical advisors for the competition and the competition selection committee are also ineligible to compete.<br />Registration</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to 13.106-1(b), the National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to award a simplified acquisition, sole source purchase order with Gartner, Inc. for the IT Research and Advisory Services.
<p>Gartner Research is the only firm capable of providing specialized information technology-focused research and advisory service. Gartner is unique both in terms of the number of specialized research analysts they provide - over 1,900 analysts, including 15 government-focused analysts with specialized Federal Government experience.</p>
<p>Gartner for Technical Professionals provides in-depth, technical advice that NSF needs for faster and more effective architecture, engineering and implementation decisions. This can be done via its documents, teleconferences, webinars, and training events lead by its technical experts who provide customized input and advice. Gartner enables NSF to quickly validate technical approaches and decisions being provided by contractors, such as Booz Allen Hamilton and Phacil.</p>
<p>NSF requires research and analysis services that are unique to Gartner (e.g., Magic Quadrant, Hype Cycles, Key IT Metrics Data, customized support of job classes, contract review services, and Services for IT Leaders). Gartner focuses on many technical areas of information technology that are not covered by other research consulting vendors. Gartner also provides toolkits - templates to supplement the research - that can be immediately applied to help solve real life IT challenges.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for informational purposes only</p>

This posting is not a solicitation or a request for competitive quotes or proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition is possible and would be advantageous to the Government.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. on 3/12/2018 by sending an e-mail to Tonia_ellen@fws.gov The point of contact for this announcement is Tonia Contracting Officer.

The primary purpose is to hire an expert consultant to plan, organize and conduct an American Eel Range States Workshop and to develop a Technical Report on the legal and illegal international trade, harvest & management, and conservation status of the American Eel throughout its range Description of Services Required: The USFWS's International Affairs Program seeks a qualified expert consultant to develop an American eel range states workshop in response to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Decision17 .187 and gather recent information on American eel harvest, management, trade and illegal trade and enforcement throughout its range; identify the challenges and difficulties in American eel harvest, management, and trademanagement; develop management recommendations that would assist in the legal and sustainable use of the species (e.g. collection of harvest data, best management practices, monitoring of trade, law enforcement, identification techniques for American eel life stages, and outreach, education and awareness raising). In addition, the consultant will produce a draft report from this workshop that Canada and the United States will submit for consideration at the 30th Meeting of the CITES Animals Committee to be held July 2018. The estimated cost to USFWS for the workshop and report is $100,000. Statutory Authority: FAR Subpart 13 .106 -1 (b) - Soliciting from a Single Source, used in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1901. Reason for Cited Authority: The Sargasso Sea Commission Secretariat is the only vendor capable of completing this workshop in the time-frame needed. They facilitated a similar workshop for the American eel in North America in October, 2015 and for the European eel in October, 2016. They have the necessary past performance, familiarity with scientific/technical and trade aspects of eels as related to the workshop objectives, familiarity with this marine species and its range countries, and experience in planning and executing international workshops for eels. The consistency and continuity afforded by this vendor, who has specifically planned and conducted workshops for eel species is important to the success and effectiveness of the proposed workshop for American eel. The Sargasso Sea Commission is a member of the IUCN network and Anguillidae ( eel) Specialist Group and therefore, has access to species experts within IUCN and the convening power necessary to successfully plan the Workshop. Lastly, they have a demonstrated track record of producing reports from the previous workshops that they conducted which is important to meeting the time-sensitive deadline of having a report submitted for consideration at the July 2018 Meeting of the CITES Animals Committee. The United States will need to submit such a report by May 17, 2018. Description of efforts: 

 Sargasso Sea Commission is the only entity capable of completing the workshop for American eel. Background: The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is found throughout the Northwest Atlantic, south along the Atlantic coast of North America, into the Gulf of Mexico and south throughout the Caribbean as far south as the northern coast of South America. International trade in Anguilla species has existed for decades and includes products related to aquaculture, food and accessories. Harvest of the species for international trade and domestic use has reduced some species to the point where they are now listed by IUCN as threatened and endangered. Once a population of one eel species becomes depleted or trade in it becomes regulated, the demand shifts to other species with less harvest pressure or fewer protections. The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) was listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II at CoP14 and was included in Appendix II in 2009. Following the listing of the species, and subsequent export bans imposed on the European Union States, there was an ensuing increase in demand, harvest and export of the American eel. A recent multi-jurisdiction U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) investigation called OPERATION BROKEN GLASS investigated the illegal trafficking of American eels. To date, the investigation has resulted in guilty pleas for 19 individuals whose combined conduct resulted in the illegal trafficking of more than $5.25 million worth of elvers. CITES Decision 17 .187 directs range States and Parties involved in trade in Anguilla spp. to: a) promote international or regional cooperation on a species-by-species basis, including the convening of regional meetings to discuss how to fill the information gaps and ensure long-term sustainability in the face of increasing demand from international trade; b) provide the Secretariat and their consultants with specific information needed for the purposes of completing Decision 17.186 a) and b) as well as the results of the regional meetings; and c) participate, where appropriate, in the technical workshops and share expertise and knowledge. Scope: USFWS requires a consultant who has experience and expertise in convening eel experts and range states to understand and appropriately manage the species. In particular, a consultant needs to have a history and experience convening key range states in eel conservation discussions and can add value to this initiative. The consultant must act as organizers and facilitators of the American eel workshop to include participation of relevant eel harvesting and trading range state government authorities. The 3-day workshop will be held and hosted by the Dominican Republic, ideally in early April 2018. The consultant, in collaboration with the sponsors, will invite representatives who are CITES, fisheries, and customs/enforcement authorities from approximately 15 American eel range states and other participants, such as species experts. The purpose of the workshop is to respond to CITES Decision 17 .187 and gather recent information on American eel science, management, trade and illegal trade and enforcement throughout its range; identify the challenges and difficulties in American eel harvest, management, and trade management; develop management recommendations that would assist in the legal and sustainable use of the species (e.g. collection of harvest data, best management practices, monitoring of trade, law enforcement, identification techniques for American eel life stages, and outreach, education and awareness raising); and to agree upon possible next steps for regional American eel conservation and management. This information will be the basis of a report that the sponsor governments may submit to upcoming CITES meetings. Deliverables: We expect the consultant to undertake the following work:  Support an American Eel Range State Workshop in April 2018, including: o In consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Fisheries and Oceans Canada to develop the agenda for the workshop, a potential list of speakers and a list of workshop participants, and the terms of reference for workshop and associated break out groups. Draft invitation letters for the approval of travel for participants in consultation with USFWS and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, that once approved it will send to invitees. Select and hire a conference venue, including adequate meeting space including lodging participants, plenary sessions and 2-3 break out groups; audiovisual needs and a meal plan (breakfast, lunch & dinner) for meeting participants.  Handle logistical and travel arrangements (invitations, lodging, meals, incidentals, insurance, transportation) for up to 65 travelers, including participants and speakers.  Arrange and hire simultaneous interpretation/translation services.  In consultation with USFWS and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, develop an American eel questionnaire to gather information and send out to participants in advance of the workshop. Compile responses from questionnaire. Facilitate workshop, working groups, and produce meeting notes that can be shared among participants. Draft the Workshop report with a synthesis of information presented and conservation recommendations for USFWS and Canada approval by May 1, 2018. Finalize the Workshop report by May 15, 2018. Requirements: The workshop consultant must have expertise, proven experience, and range state convening power relevant to the conservation of American eel and be capable of delivering the Workshop in the host country, the Dominican Republic. The consultant should be familiar with the biology, trade and management of the American eel across its range and build upon its previous experience in planning and supporting this Workshop. Logistical planning for the workshop will require sustained communication and correspondence with USFWS and Fisheries and Oceans Canada staff. Costs associated with performing the required duties shall be budgeted by the workshop consultant including salary, airfare, ground transportation, meals, lodging, and travel, supplies, interpretation and other expenses. Place of Performance: The work will be performed at the location of the consultant's offices and at the site determined by the consultant in the Dominican Republic. Period of Performance: The project will require commitment from consultants beginning upon the date of the award and lasting through May 31, 2018, including full-day commitments for at least during the 3-4 days of the workshop itself. In addition the consultants will be required to perform on a part-time commitment basis during the planning period before the workshop and after the workshop to produce a draft Report.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /></strong><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: <br /></strong><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a simple mechanism for the clean cutting of high strength and high toughness carbon nanotube/polymer fiber composites on demand without high blade wear, replacement rates and related high costs. The cutter is comprised of a set of blades both to score through any resin coating the fibers and to provide an electrical current to cut through the fiber/composite reinforcement and any remaining resin in yarns, tapes and sheets. This technology offers the potential of a very meaningful advance in a critical subsystem area (CNT/composite cutting) in a growing industry. Industry experts recognize the issue as extremely important and one with unsatisfactory solutions for much of the industry, in particular for product manufacturers who turn the CNT/composite raw materials into products of many varieties and properties. The initial application of this technology addresses a rapidly growing component of the market, 3D CNT printing, in which the high strength of CNTs, and especially reinforcements such as yarns, tapes and sheets makes them very difficult to cut. This filament cutting mechanism takes advantage of the electrical conductivity and chemistry of CNT fiber reinforcement to provide a means to achieve clean and precise cuts while utilizing a low amount of energy. The technology employs an opposing set of blades (knives, cursors, or wheels) that serve as both cutter and electrodes, and between which the region of the filament to be cut is isolated. The blades serve to score and degrade any resin coating in the reinforcement fiber, enabling the oppositely dc charged blades to come into contact with the electrically conductive fiber, completing an electrical circuit. This completion of the circuit causes a surge of electrical current to flow through the fiber in the small region between the blades and thus causes the fiber to rapidly heat up. The rapid heating causes the oxidation of any polymer that is on the fiber surface. Additionally, rapid heating also causes ablation/vaporization of the fiber and/or polymer coating. There is no shearing action required to cut the very strong, tough fibers, which eliminates unintended damage to the fibers due to them being dragged by the blade. Increased blade life is thus an additional benefit. A key aspect of the technology is that it is designed as an in-line, embedded technology for applications such as its initial design goal 3D printing. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong><br />

Existing regional and bilateral maritime law enforcement programs with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam focus on developing institutional functions and strengthening operational capabilities in the maritime domain. INL Manila is managing more than $10 million in maritime law enforcement assistance funds and coordinating with partners such as Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and Joint Interagency Task Force West (JIATFW) an even greater investment by these organizations in bilateral maritime law enforcement and related technical assistance programs in the Philippines. The maritime law enforcement assistance is focused primarily on Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), National Coast Watch System, and Philippine National Police-Maritime Group. Several of the projects currently in the initial stages of development such as the construction and startup of a PCG Technical and Maritime Training Center involve joint investments by the Government of the Philippines, JUSMAG, JIATFW, and INL. This assistance will support INL's continuing training and capacity building efforts for these maritime law enforcement organizations.</p>

The Advisor will also work with colleagues and counterparts in the U.S. Government and the Government of the Philippines to foster maritime law enforcement cooperation throughout Philippine security forces. The Advisor will reside in Manila, with considerable time spent traveling and working in the field with INL's implementing partners.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Groupware Inc., DBA iSupport Software&nbsp;for a iSupport Software Enterprise License Renewal. <br />iSupport is an approved, CDC level Ill commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solution used by NCHHSTP and other organizations within the Agency as both a service desk ticketing platform and configurable administrative management tool. iSupport has been formally reviewed, evaluated, and approved by the NCHHSTP Information Systems Security Officer, CDC Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) and the CDC 508 Accessibility and Compliance Office. NCHHSTP iSupport applications/instances have been specifically configured to provide specific capabilities and meet unique requirements. The continued maintenance of this software is critical to the Center's centralized processing and payment of travel expenses, small purchase approvals, facilities requisitions and managing personnel actions. In addition, iSupport is also the platform used for submitting, tracking and resolving service desk tickets from users of various programmatic computer applications developed in-house. Moving to another technology would introduce risks and incur significant cost increases that include (a) conducting a detailed alternative analysis of potential alternative solutions, (b) purchasing and supporting a different technology/platform, (c) construction and testing of new user interfaces and applications compatible with the new platform, and (d) configuring a new system to meet specific Program requirements and specifications and (e) migration of legacy information/data into the new environment/system.
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within Seven (7) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.
