<SUBJECT>A--In-Situ TRU Delineation and Waste Removal of Radioactive Waste at Hanford 618-10 and 618-11 Burial Grounds
<SOLNBR>DE-RA26-03NT41755
<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, johnson@netl.doe.gov;Mary Price, Contract Specialist, 412-386-6179, mprice@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) announces the availability of Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) No. DE-RA26-03NT41755 entitled In-Situ TRU Delineation and Waste Removal of Radioactive Waste at Hanford 618-10 and 618-11 Burial Grounds, expected to be published on or about May 30, 2003.   The PRDA supports the mission of the Office of Science & Technology (OST), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM), U. S. Department of Energy  (DOE).  The objectives of this procurement are to demonstrate technologies for in-situ delineation and excavation of transuranic (TRU) waste utilizing innovative technologies at three Hanford burial grounds.  Using the 618-10 Cold Test Facility and the 218-W-4C Low-Level Burial Grounds (LLBG) as initial demonstration sites, the technologies will subsequently be applied to Hanford?s 618-10 & 618-11 burial grounds.  Successful completion of this project will accelerate cleanup of the Columbia River Corridor, thus meeting the objectives of the Performance Management Plan for the Accelerated Cleanup of the Hanford Site, (DOE/RL-2002-47, Rev. D) by accelerating cleanup of the Columbia River Corridor for industrial use, and support fulfillment of Record of Decisions that have been put in place for these sites. The proposed work will be accomplished in three phases.  The evaluation and selection of technologies for demonstration will be completed in Phase I. Cold demonstration at the Hanford 618-10 cold test facility and a hot demonstration of retrieval technology at Hanford?s 218-W-4C Low-Level Burial Grounds will comprise Phase II.  Based on the success of these demonstrations, a follow-on hot retrieval demonstration at the Hanford 618-10 and/or 618-11 Burial Grounds is proposed for Phase III.  Reporting and D&D and removal of equipment from the demonstration sites are proposed for Phase II and III. The burial grounds are located at the Department of Energy Hanford site in southeastern Washington State.  The 618-10 and 618-11 burial grounds were operated for disposal of pre-1970 generated TRU and low to high-level activity waste to support defense production of plutonium at the Hanford site. Documentation of materials placed in the burial grounds is incomplete, but it is recognized that high-activity fission products, low-level, and mixed low level radioactive waste, plutonium, uranium, and other TRU wastes were placed into the waste sites in various forms. Chemical species in both burial grounds may include solid metallic sodium, beryllium residues, contaminated lead shielding, technetium oxide, promethium oxide, zirconium cladding, potentially pyrophoric metal turnings, thorium oxide, other thorium compounds, and uranium compounds.  Radioisotopes may include tritium, carbon-14, cobalt-60, zinc-65, strontium-90, ruthenium-103, iodine-131, cesium-137, cerium-144, promethium-147, radium-226, thorium-232, uranium-233, uranium-235, neptunium-237, uranium-238, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, plutonium-240/241, americium-241, and curium-244. This project will provide support to the selection of final remedies for portions of the 200 and 600 Areas through the demonstration of waste delineation and hot spot removal that provide immediate risk reduction.  A mixture of technologies is assumed by all parties to be the solution. Teaming with other firms to provide a comprehensive approach for various aspects of this solicitation is strongly encouraged.  Since the selected remedy must have regulator approval, the project will also emphasize effective regulator and stakeholder involvement. Prior to excavation at the 618-10 and 618-11 burial grounds, pre-excavation characterization is required to be demonstrated that has the capability to delineate burial ground boundaries and waste locations and to identify significant contaminant sources present at the sites.  The capability of technology to delineate the location of the horizontal and vertical boundaries of the burial ground trenches, the exact location of vertical pipe units and caissons and the location within the burial ground of potential significant sources of contaminants must be demonstrated before excavation begins.  To aid in planning the demonstration of excavation technology and to determine health and safety precautions, the types of wastes to be exhumed during the hot demonstrations in Phases II and III must be determined.  In addition, if possible, the characterization technology should also be capable of delineating the physical size of waste masses or containers, the quantity of these waste masses or containers, and the concentration or radiation intensity of the wastes to be exhumed.  The high dose rate of the wastes is expected to require remote excavation and handling of materials to protect site workers. Environmental controls will be required to prevent unintended release of contaminants to the environment.  Field characterization of exhumed waste for TRU content, radiation type and intensity, will be conducted, preferably on a real-time basis.  In addition, completion of the appropriate safety basis documentation will be necessary, including site-specific health and safety plans, prior to any excavation activities.  At this time, based upon limited inventory information, burial grounds 618-10 and 618-11 are both considered as hazard category 3 nuclear facilities.  Classification of these facilities could change during the course of site characterization and subsequent remediation activities. This project will contribute to accelerating the remediation of the 618-10 and 618-11 burial grounds and to significant reduction in overall project costs. This could be accomplished by removing tritium and radionuclide source terms, thereby mitigating the future contamination of both the vadose zone and groundwater; aid in the future selection of excavation technologies for both contact handled (CH) and remote handled (RH) TRU waste; and provide lessons-learned and potential bench-marking that will assist in the refinement of these technologies prior to full field-deployment at these burial grounds. Cold testing of retrieval and excavation technologies for TRU waste and/or caisson and pipe unit removal at the 618-10 burial ground cold test facility during year two will not only minimize safety concerns and issues during actual ?hot? retrieval and excavation activities, but will also contribute to the ALARA and Integrated Safety Management Principles.  Once these technologies have been demonstrated during the duration of this four year project, they can then be deployed in the future at Hanford as well as other sites throughout the DOE complex that require in-situ location/identification and retrieval of TRU and tritium source-term wastes.

<SUBJECT>A--Alternatives for Characterization and Removal of Deposits at Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plants
<SOLNBR>DE-RA26-03NT41771
<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, johnson@netl.doe.gov;Mary Price, Contract Specialist, 412-386-6179, mprice@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) announces the availability of Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) No. DE-RA26-03NT41771 entitled Alternatives for Characterization and Removal of Deposits at Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plants, expected to be published on or about May 30, 2003.   The PRDA supports the mission of the Office of Science & Technology (OST), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM), U.S. Department of Energy   (DOE). The objective of this procurement is to develop state-of-the-art alternatives for the characterization and removal of enriched uranium (EU) and technetium-99 (TC99) in the deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) processes of the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) at Piketon, Ohio.  The alternatives will be developed through an integrated system engineering study and development of next-generation technologies and material products, which are compatible with ultimate disposition paths and disposal sites for the materials. Such processes will focus on a safer, more cost effective approach to characterize and decontaminate equipment at PORTS, which will optimize flexibility in ultimate disposition. The proposed work will be accomplished in three phases:  Phase I will include evaluation of available technologies and develop a detailed project plan for the project based on the specific PORTS GDP equipment;  Phase II will include testing of a mock-up GDP equipment for a non-intrusive nondestructive assay (NDA) for characterization of EU and Tc99 in GDP equipment and components, and for laboratory scale testing of viable alternative approaches for deposit removal technology, identified in Phase I,  which meet the waste acceptance criteria for the designated disposal facility.   Based on the successful results in Phase II, Phase III will include the testing and demonstration of the selected alternative technology on actual GDP equipment in the field at the PORTS site. The baseline approach to characterization of GDP equipment and components uses nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques to determine the location of deposits of U235 within the process equipment; the confidence level is about +/- 50% and only indicates the qualitative presence of deposits.  Results are adversely affected by GDP equipment geometry/shielding, proximity of other nearby deposits, and inadequacies in models used to convert field data.  The resulting risks of over-identifying or under-identifying individual deposits or overall masses of uranium in hold-up deposits will result in reduced confidence, excessive margins for safety, and significantly increased management costs. In-situ characterization of GDP components via high-accuracy NDA techniques is required to identify locations and quantities of a EU and Tc99 material holdup within the process and to demonstrate compliance with nuclear criticality safety (NCS) guidelines.  Quantification of EU deposits prior to equipment D&D is necessary to identify process equipment requiring special handling to minimize potential criticality concerns, as well as to ensure that EU levels are below that considered always safe when equipment is placed in close proximity to other EU contaminated equipment within the disposal cell array. Apart from the need to quantify EU levels within process equipment for NCS determinations, accurate determination of EU quantities is desirable for material accountability purposes, improve worker safety and to ensure that EU levels will not exceed disposal facility waste acceptance criteria. The baseline procedures to remove EU and Tc99 deposits require the dismantlement of the process equipment cell and equipment components to provide physical access to the deposits to allow manual deposit removal. Reliance on equipment dismantlement down to a component level is labor intensive, time consuming, and creates a health and safety risk for the worker and the environment. For example, the current dismantlement approach at the GDP at Oak Ridge, TN uses thermal cutting to separate the equipment and manual methods to remove the deposits. Not only is this approach a time consuming and labor intensive, but also has resulted in four fire incidents due to the thermal cutting. Because PORTS produced higher EU, nuclear criticality issues associated with the high enrichment portions of the facility are significant.  Deposit removal is necessary to alleviate these criticality concerns in the removal and disposition of the equipment.  Additionally, removal of the deposits helps to minimize the risk of contamination to the D&D worker and the environment and facilitates the disposition of the equipment in the safest and most cost-effective manner possible.

<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) whose purpose is to extend the ordering and performance periods for the Reconnaissance, Intelligence Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services (RPS) Contracts with Lockheed Martin Corp. (F19628-97-D-0008) and Raytheon Corp. (F19628-97-D-0009). The Contracts ordering period will be increased by (3) years, from ending 31 December 03 to 31 December 06. The Contracts period of performance will also be increased by (3) years, from ending 31 December 04 to 31 December 07. This change will not increase the ceiling price of the two Contracts. The extension is a contract action required to provide for the acquisition of upgrades to existing  Subsystems, Ground Control Processor (GCP) and Deployable Ground Intercept Facility (DGIF), which were developed and fielded by the aforementioned Contractors, as parts of the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS). The anticipated upgrade candidates planned for functional integration into the two Subsystems, are Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) and Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). The NCCT Program goal is to demonstrate initial concepts of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform collaboration over a common network to expedite persecution of time sensitive targets. Formation of initial concepts is scheduled thru 2005. The ASIP Sensor Program is a development effort centered on providing a near-term SIGINT capability on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its development period will proceed thru 2007. The scope of the subject RPS Contracts scope is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades. The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as the only holders of RPS Contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements"  This notice does not constitute a request-for-proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Reference Note 22.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to SPARTA, Inc. to develop advanced enemy threat discrimination and tracking algorithms and a state-of-the art decision theory concept known as Decision Architecture.  The required support consists of a technical director and integrator for the Decision Architecture, software developer for three of the Decision Architecture elements, and software developer for a variety of tracking and discrimination algorithms.  As technical director, SPARTA will oversee the development of the System Model and the Global Planner.  The System Model, or discrimination fusion engine, is an advanced mathematical representation of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that will enable fusion of sensor information from across multiple BMDS sensors.  The Global Planner provides BMDS sensor resource and weapons resource decision-making capabilities given the information in the System Model.  As the decision architecture element developer, SPARTA will continue to create prototypes of the System Model elements and the Global Planner elements needed for integration to the BMDS in Block 06.  SPARTA will also develop algorithms to support the development of models for forward based sensor environments and discrimination and tracking algorithms for the BMDS.  No other source has the required expertise needed to deliver the first decision architecture prototypes in 1Q CY05 as well as support customer development of the decision architecture over the remainder of the 3 ½ year period of performance.  The estimated cost of the contract is $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 during the period of performance.  See Note 22.******

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: CSC is the only company that can work with this protocol. All components required to complete this final 15% of this system must be compatible with hardware already in place. Use of any other manufacturers equipment would cost the Government additional time and money while attempting to integrate the different systems. Thus Chesapeake Sciences Corporation (CSC) is the only vendor that can meet this requirement.  NAICS Code 541330 Applies

This acquisition will comply with the procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, the Commercial Activities (CA) program. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government in-house operations to contractor operations.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office has a requirement for a follow-on contract for engineering services to conduct on-going engineering evaluations and studies of a 310-Bcf gas storage reservoir that contains approximately 31 Bcf of injected Government and privately owned helium in a partially depleted natural gas field approximately 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The original contract, NAR020100, was a small business set-aside, awarded to NITEC, LLC of Denver Colorado, on June 27, 2002.  Under contract NAC020100, NITEC, LLC performed an engineering study to (1) determine the validity of using the bhp/z vs. cumulative production curve to determine ultimate, recoverable reserves; (2) estimated the structure and volume of the reservoir; and (3) developed a model and simulation of the reservoir using off-the-shelf and customized computer software products.  NITEC, LLC reviewed prior engineering reports, available pressure tests, deliverability tests, production and injection volumes and related gas compositions.  From this, NITEC, LLC developed a material balance equation that confirmed the reserve volumes used by the BLM.  Much of this work would have to be repeated, at extra time and cost, by any new consultant before starting the history match phase of reservoir simulation.  Additionally, NITEC, LLC analyzed the available geological data, the Brown Dolomite, and completed structure maps for the Brown Dolomite.  Much of the geophysical analysis was completed using proprietary software.  All of the logs and core data for the field were analyzed, and then the results used to quantify the extent and characteristics of natural fracturing.  Pressure build-up tests were evaluated to tie performance based reservoir permeability to that obtained from cores.  Any other consultant would have to repeat much of the above work, at extra time and cost, before even beginning a simulation.  For the above-stated reasons, the circumstances permitting other than full and open competition as cited in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" are germaine to this procurement.  This statutory authority applies as a follow-on contract awarded to anyone other than NITEC, LLC would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  As such, the BLM intends to award a firm-fixed price, not-to-exceed, labor hour contract, sole source, to NITEC, LLC, for the follow-on effort described above.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, the Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528.  See Note 22!

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for the following commercial items:

-Ultimate Building Machine (UBM) Model 120 to include spare parts kit and accessories
-Ultimate Building Machine (UBM) Model 240 to include spare parts kit and accessories

Operational Use-  
USAF structural engineers use the Ultimate Building Machines (UBM) and accessories to construct expedient metal bread-loaf/gable end shaped buildings.  This unique construction industry machinery is the only known of its kind and is engineered, manufactured, and distributed by Mobility In Construction (MIC) Industries, Reston, Virginia.

Extended Description-
The UBM is a trailer mounted computer controlled metal forming building system.  The system consists of three components, which perform distinct functions.  First, the Skate Roller Metal Forming Machine transforms rolled flat metal stock into a trough.  The trough is then run through the Curver Assembly, which bends the trough to the desired building profile controlled by the onboard computer.

The curved troughs are then assembled in groups of three (picks) and craned into place.  Each pick is seamed and tack welded in place awaiting encasement in the concrete foundation.  

UBM Models 120 and 240 perform the same functions; however, the 240 will accept thicker gauge steel for larger buildings specifications.

Accessories essential to this building system include, but are not limited to:
-Seamers, which connect each trough together with a rollover seam
-Concrete form system, which is engineered to support expedient construction
-Coil transport trailer, which stores and transports rolled metal stock for immediate use


This currently is a sole source item supplied to the USAF Engineers.  The 341st Contracting Squadron is attempting to solicit competition.  Please reply immediately to TSgt Amy Pope, amy.pope@malmstrom.af.mil with information regarding this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIH MRI Research Facility (NMRF) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Invivo Research Inc., 12601 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 for the purchase of a Magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system.   The In Vivo NMR Research Center is a service center for the scientific community to work towards the advancement of In Vivo NMR technology, its application to animal physiology, and ultimately, its application in the clinical setting.  The magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system will be used with a NMR Center’s government owned GE 1.5 Tesla magnet for performing patient and animal studies.  In order to run patient and animal studies EKG gating is needed when running cardiac sequences.  When performing patient studies, NIBP or non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry is required to monitor the patient.  When performing animal experiments, capnography, anesthetic agents and invasive blood pressure are required to monitor and maintain a stable physiological preparation through the course of the experiment.  The Invivo system is able to detect the QRS complexes during any of the fast cardiac imaging sequences including the hybrid echoplanar perfusion sequence which the NMRF has been using for the last couple years.  The Invivo magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system is the only piece of equipment known to the  researcher that meets the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet all of the above requirements, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 22, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to cancel Solicitation DTCG23-03-B-TMX030 for Satellite Communications.  The IFB was posted on February 27, 2003 and bids were received on March 25, 2003.  This cancellation is in accordance with FAR 14.404-1(a) which permits cancellation of an invitation after bid opening only for a compelling reason.   The IFB was ambiguous in how the bidders were to price the required services, and how the government would evaluate the prices.  The IFB also did not provide a consideration of all factors of costs to the government in accordance with FAR 14.404-1(c)(4).  The IFB need to be revised.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government and all interested parties that the bid be cancelled and resolicited.

<DESC>This Amendment No. A001 is issued to provide the following information:

1.  The frequency and range information provided by the Government for the portable radios is:  UHF band 403 MHz to 420MHz.

2.  The Government will not entertain proposed substitutes since only Motorola radios will satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.  This is due to maintaining compatibility with the existing portable radio system (i.e., existing batteries and charges, and the existing parts stock).  The programming of the radios must be performed by on-site personnel due to security reasons.  The purchase of another manufacturer's radio would require additional programming software and cables.  

3.  The Government will handle all programming of the radios and frequencies. 

4.  Due to internal reasons, the Government will not require the radios to be on charge at once, thus the difference between the number of charger positions and the number of radios ordered.

The date for receipt of offers is unchanged as a result of this amendment.

END OF AMENDMENT NO. A001 TO RFQ NO. EMV-2003-RQ-0022.

<DESC>This is a requirement for 1 each, NSN 4920-01-025-5236RN, PN 989D809G01.

 This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.

<DESC>This modification to subject solicitation is hereby issued to extend the date of receipt of offers from 16 May 2003 to 21 May 2003.
 
Additionally, the following inoformation is hereby provided for clarification purposes:  

The fan housing should have an inner wall constructed of perforated steel to provide the most benefit from the insulation or sound absorbing material. Placing the perforated steel on the outside of the fan housing is not acceptable. I understand that the insulation will absorb some VOC's and become hazardous or possibly flammable when the perforated steel is on the inside.  That is part of the reason for the requirement in paragraph 3.4.5.3 for the fan belts and pulleys to be encased in a dust-proof , vapor tight housing. This will contain any hazardous or flammable conditions in the fan housing and keep electrical devices such as the motor from being exposed to hazardous or flammable conditions. 

In addition to the above information, the Special Notice published under Reference Number-F2MAN031000100 dated/posted 12 May 2003 is still applicable to this solcitation.

This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.


QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:  The following answers are provided in rsponse to questions received:

QUESTION:
	a.   Who will be providing (Government or Contractor) the standard delivery hardware as depicted in the statement? (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph e and Demonstrator #2, Page 2, Paragraph e).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: The contractor shall provide standard delivery hardware.  The intent is to provide the hardware from the demonstrator outlets to four patients.  The hardware should include standard flow control equipment.  For this demonstration project, it is suggested that the hardware package include 4 each nasal cannula, 2 each non-rebreather face masks, and 1 each bag valve mask.  The contractor may suggest other quantities of these patient oxygen delivery items. 

Demonstrator #2: The contractor shall provide distribution hardware from the 2 each paratrooper supply outlets on the demonstrator to the 8 ea. remote paratrooper outlets.  The contractor is not required to provide delivery hardware for the medical outlets.   

QUESTION:
	b.  Does the hardware described in question a above count towards the total weight of the system? (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph d). 

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: Yes.

QUESTION:
	c.  What are the specific airdrop parameters that must be met? Specifically, what is the terminal velocity of a 75 lb. mass being airdropped?  (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph i).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: The intent is to be able to airdrop the unit, as an individual unit or as part of a standard pallet, from an aircraft cargo ramp at normal airdrop altitudes.  The unit must have full operational capability after landing.  The parachute will be supplied by the Government and secured on the unit by the Government prior to the airdrop mission.  The contractor must ensure the parachute can be properly attached and quickly detached.  Further, the parachute would not count toward the total weight of the unit. 

QUESTION:
	d.  What is the length of the oxygen hoses required for the manifold?  (Demonstrator #2, Page 2, Paragraph e).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The length of the hose that connects the demonstrator paratrooper supply outlet to 4 each paratrooper quick disconnects is estimated at 20 feet.  Two hoses are required. 


QUESTION:
	e.  What is the duration requirement of oxygen flow at 11 lpm for this system?  (Demonstrator #2, Page 3, Paragraph f).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The demonstrator does not have a duration requirement at 11 LPM.  

QUESTION:
f.  Is the Contractor Statement Of Work (CSOW) required for Step 1 or Step 2 of the solicitation process? Or both?

ANSWER:
Both.  

QUESTION:
g.  Is ballistic protection required on the top and bottom in addition to all four sides on all the systems? 

ANSWER:
Ballistic protection is required on all sides and top and bottom of all systems.  Side protection would be the most critical.  The Government is aware the contractor will require some openings in the ballistic protection hardware to ensure proper functioning of the unit and access to the connections and controls/displays.  Therefore, it is suggested that the contractor design openings which do not expose the most vulnerable internal components to ballistic rounds.  The intent is that the unit should not injure anyone or damage equipment nearby after being struck by 7.62 mm rounds.  It is acceptable for the unit to be non-functional after being hit by ballistic rounds.  

QUESTION:
	h.  What is the number of total outlets for Demonstrator #2?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2 Outlets (i.e. outlets on the unit):
a. 2 ea. paratrooper supply outlets with each capable of delivering 100 ambient LPM at sea level.
b. 1 ea. standard paratrooper outlet, to be used if one of the remote paratrooper outlets is damaged.
c. 4 ea. standard medical outlets.

Demonstrator #2 Remote Outlets:
8 ea. standard paratrooper outlets.

QUESTION:
	i.  Will the paratrooper and medical outlets be used simultaneously?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The paratrooper and medical outlets will not be used simultaneously.

QUESTION:
	j, What is the maximum system flow for Demonstrator #2?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The maximum flow would be 200 ambient liters/minute at sea level.

QUESTION:
Demonstrator #2:  The Combat Oxygen System solicitation refers to "Liquid oxygen storage volume: 25 Liters" (see Advanced Demonstrator #2, Paratrooper Oxygen System). Does this mean that the proposed system should use LOX (liquid oxygen), or was this terminology used simply as a measurement of volume (capacity)?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2:  The proposed system should use liquid oxygen and the storage volume should be 25 liters.

<DESC>The point of contact is hereby changed to reflect Franklin Gunn.  

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has the responsibility of performing Background Investigations on personnel selected to enter on duty with USAID and to update security clearances on personnel already on board.  A Contract Background Investigation Program has been established to contract these Investigations out to trained and experienced investigators, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have 5 years of current experience conducting personnel security Background Investigations.  

Contractors are required to conduct personnel Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI), Periodic Reinvestigations (SSBI-PR) and other personnel security-related investigations under this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  Background Investigations will be conducted in full compliance with Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, Security Policy Board Issuance's I-97 and 2-97, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Right to Financial Privacy Act and other relevant regulations, and USAID/SEC policies and procedures which will be made known to the Contractor.  Investigations shall further comply with the standards and requirements prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapters 731 through 736.

Contractors must have, or be able to obtain, a Top Secret security clearance based on a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation to be considered for award. Contractors must be willing to undergo orientation training and attend periodic training conferences in the Washington, DC area.

Contractors will be assigned to a Primary Regional Area (PRA) in reasonable proximity to their residence (to the extent possible, within a 150-mile radius of the residence) where the majority of their work will be performed.  Nonetheless, the Contractor must be available to accept work involving travel to other PRAs and/or anywhere in the United States and Overseas locations. Work assignments will be made on the basis of workload and/or financial considerations as the needs of USAID dictate.  It is preferred that the Special Agent possesses a current U.S. passport in order to accept work that requires overseas travel. 

With each investigation call/order, Contractors shall be tasked to complete the following investigative coverage (leads):
- Schedule and conduct a Personal Interview of applicant;
  Verify identity and citizenship status;  
  Verify employment during the past 5 to 7 years through records   and interviews; 
  Verify claims of residence during the past 3 years through   records and interviews;  
  Verify statements of educational achievement through records and   interviews;
  Conduct interviews of references; 
  Conduct interviews of ex-spouses;
  Conduct Local Agency (law enforcement agency) Checks (LACS); 
  Verification of public records, divorce, bankruptcy,   civil/criminal actions;  
  Expand the investigation, as necessary; 
  Security or other types of Special Investigations will normally   be conducted in close association with Security Branch     management.  Special projects related to investigative/operational case management may be required.

Contractors will be expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Completion of at least three (3) investigations per month is required and mandatory upon the availability of assignments.  Performance reviews will be conducted on an annual basis. 

It is preferred that Contractors be computer literate and proficient in a word processing application, preferably Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, for the preparation of Reports of Investigation and other relevant correspondence and forms.  Knowledge of Microsoft Excel is desirable for the preparation of vouchers and other forms.  
 
Each call order will specify the following: 

(1) The work to be performed by the Contractor; 
(2) The place(s) where the work is to be performed; 
(3) An effective date and a completion date of the order; 
(4) The number or work hours ordered; 
(5) The fixed hourly rate; 
(6) A fixed price which shall constitute the  maximum obligations of the Government to the Contractor for performance of the order and, 
(7) where applicable to the specific order, Government furnished property and/or logistical support will be provided to the Contractor.

Contractors shall be paid for authorized services provided at the fixed hourly rate of $33.00, plus authorized expenses.  The hourly rate will increase by $1.00 per hour effective for all Orders issued on or after the first day of each fiscal year.  Higher hourly rates are payable for priority designated work when specifically authorized.  Rate adjustments will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 

The Contract Line Items will be split into costs for Background Investigative Services and Other Direct Costs (i.e., travel) for each call order.  Each Order will contain (in addition to the fixed hourly rate), other authorized direct costs necessary for the performance of the work including travel and transportation, per diem or subsistence.  

When specifically authorized, per diem and expenses will be paid for required travel.  Applicable per diem rates shall be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation, Title 41 CFR, Chapter 301. 

All applicants will be responsible to register with the designated Financial Management company, as applicable. 

USAID intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2007.  Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a Blanket Purchase Agreement.  A Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is not a contract.  A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  The purchase limit of each call/order shall not exceed $5,000,000 in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 collectively.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the USAID representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services. 

The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition.  Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 99) Evaluation. Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Incorporated by reference are FAR 52.212.1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial. 

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

The USAID will award  BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on  past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of  USAID's terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be assessed points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of  at least 65 will be considered for issuance of a BPA.

a. 	Experience (60 Points)  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  USAID will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breath, it depth, and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA.  Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment, experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience), experience with or exposure to Foreign Affairs Agencies, computer proficiency.

b.	Past Performance  (40 Points)  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  The USAID will contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, USAID will contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases. USAID will assess the vendor's  communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. 

Contractors with recent USAID experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided USAID.  USAID will consider performance contractors have previously rendered to USAID to be more influential than past performance for another source.

c. Acceptability.  The USAID will determine the acceptability of each offer on a pass or fail basis.  An offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the RFP, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If an vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, the USAID will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so. 


Offerors wishing to respond shall submit a current resume with your SSN as well as all the requested information within the content of this solicitation initially by January 10, 2003.  This solicitation will be open throughout the period of this blanket purchase agreement.  All proposals received after this initial date will be evaluated on a quarterly basis.  All responsible sources may submit an offer of interest throughout this time period.  Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  (No phone calls will be accepted.)  
Proposals are to be submitted via mail at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 7.09-105, Washington, DC 20523.  POC: Franklin Gunn.  The proposed procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer questions from potential offerors,  amend the specifications and amend the delivery schedule.

1.  Answers to questions asked by potential offerors are as follows:
Question 1.   What wafer size is required? The specification states a need for 3", 4", 5" & 6" wafers but other sections ask for 4", 5" & 6" while the minimum
requirement states 6". The wafer size requirement will dictate strongly
what type system we quote. Answer 1.  	We require a furnace that will handle 3", 4", 5 & 6" wafers. Initially we will be using 3 & 4" wafers so we require wafer carriers for those sizes.  At some point we may be using larger wafers in which case we will want larger carriers.  Question 2.  How many wafers are there per run?  The specification asks for "boats" of 25 wafers for 4, 5, 6".  Answer 2.  The number of wafers per run will depend on the particular researchers needs.  The system has to be flexible enough to handle 1- 2 wafers per run up to 25 wafers per run.  Question 3.   What will be the maximum process temperature the Oxide system will operate at?  Answer 3. 1200 deg C., See section  4.2:  Required tube specifications.  Question 4.  How do you intend to run the "combo Nitride-Poly" system? Can either a tube change or gas change option be used to process both films or is there a specific configuration requirement?  Answer 4.	A gas change option can be used. If a tube change is easily accomplished (<15 min to change) that option is acceptable.  Question 5.  We did not see any reference to a defectivity specification. Is this correct in that we do not have to provide a specification for defects?  Answer 5.  The specifications are amended.   See paragraph 3. below.  Question 6.	 What is the film thickness?  Answer 6.	This will vary depending on researchers needs. Typical thicknesses will be less than 0.5 microns. This is not an upper limit however.  Question 7.	 What is the projected award date and delivery requirement?  Answer 7. 	The projected award date should be 30 days after evaluations are completed.  The delivery requirement is 75 days from date of award.  Question 8.  Section 4.1- Furnace Section.  We would like to prefer type "S" spike and profile TC's.  Answer 8.  Type S is ok.  Question 9.  208/240 V is a strange combination! Is it 208/110 V or 400/240 V?  +N, +PE? 4 or 5 wire?  Answer 9. 	We have available 208 Volt Single phase, 208 Volt 3 Phase and 120 Volt Single Phase.  Question 10.   Section4.82 - Wet Ox Steam Generator With Auto Refill,  a) Is outside torch (Hydrox/Pyrogenic) acceptable? b) H2 is available? c) With Bubbler?  Answer 10.  No in all cases.  Question 11.  Section 4.91 - Nitride Poly 4 Loop Gas Tray Design  a) Are digital MFC's with Device Net communication acceptable?  Answer 11: 	Yes.  Question 12.	Section 8.2 - Spare Quartz Kit for Atmospheric and LPCVD Process Sizes are not CT standard. Are other sizes acceptable?
Atm. (with twin rod) ID 238mm/OD 253mm; (front) 40/25mm (rear); Atm. (with CT paddle) ID 222mm/OD 235mm (front) 40/25mm (rear).  Answer 12:	Sizes that meet wafer sizes are acceptable.  Question 13.  LPCVD (with twin rod) ID 247mm/OD 253mm (front) 60mm (rear), LPCVD (with CT paddle) ID 215mm/OD 221mm (front) 60mm (rear).  Answer 13:	  Sizes that meet wafer sizes are acceptable.  Question 14. Section 8.4 Hoods for removal of cooling exhaust air. Is a water cooling system acceptable?  Answer 14.  Yes.  Question 15.  Delivery.   Is a delivery time of 90-120 days acceptable?  Answer 15: A delivery time of 90 days is acceptable.  2.  The delivery schedule is changed to read 90 days from date of award.  3.  The following is added to Section 3.0 of the Specifications:  All offerors shall include in their proposal, the lowest defect density their system will meet.

<DESC>NA On behalf of the Project Manager-Mobile Electric Power, the US Army Communications-Electronic Command (CECOM), RD&E Center, Command and Control Directorate, Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA is performing a market survey of com mercial & military power distribution equipment. The CECOM Power Generation Branch is searching for a new family of power distribution equipment capable of transmitting electrical power between military power generating sources (see www.pmmep.org for specs ) and power consuming equipment. The desired power distribution equipment must, at a minimum distribute power from central power source(s), be man-portable, provide flexibility to unit operations and be quickly assembled and disassembled for rapid relocati on. In addition the power distribution and illumination equipment must operate in climatic conditions of -25 degrees to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, rain, humidity, salt spray, and fungus. It must be rugged enough to support field use, must be designed to be us ed with one and three phase generator sets rated at 120/208 VAC, 120/240 VAC, 50/60 Hz and 5 to 200 kW and must take in 60-200 amps and output 20-100 amps. The power distribution equipment must be compatible with International Standardization Organization (ISO) containers, Standardized Integrated Command Post (SICPs) System Rigid Wall Shelters, and Tent Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER). The power distribution equipment will be used to form a consolidated power network where the cable distance from ge nerator set to load will be limited to 300 feet. In particular, the new power distribution and illumination equipment must be capable of the functionality contained within the Army's current Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) (speci fications can be found at https://www.logsa.army.mil/etms/data/A/069909.pdf) at a minimum, and offer benefits in terms of cost, deployability, functionality, etc. CECOM is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing t he contractor's experience in design, development, fabrication and testing of their power distribution systems, detailed specifications of their power distribution systems, organizational capabilities, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for pot ential future government procurements. The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recogn ize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. All responses to this market research shall be submitted wit hin 45 calendar days of the date of this announcement.

Incumbent will also be required to have contact with Congressional delegations and other visitors interested in the police aviation program.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research seeking sources for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions to provide the services of a Web Content Management System (CMS). Background: SSA recently completed a redesign of its current site accessible at http://www.socialsecurity.gov.  This project is limited to implementation of a Web Content Management System on the central areas of the SSA public Web site.  Presently, the Web site is comprised of approximately 20,000 pages, most in HTML and PDF formats. The Web site also has 18 online applications that are written in Perl, IBM Websphere, and other programming platforms.  Current files are copied to a staging Web server on a flow basis and moved to 3 main Web servers each hour via FTP.  Although most content pages are static, SSA may convert some or part of the Web site to a database-driven platform(s).  Capabilities: The CMS must be capable of use by 100 to 300 owners who publish content to the Web site.   The content creation and posting process typically involves only one level of approval. Current content owners vary in their functionality and rights and include users who author, review, and approve content.  All content owners will be required to use a CMS to publish content and work rules will be established to provide the necessary reviews prior to publishing.  Content owners have varying degrees of skill in authoring Web pages, so the CMS solution should provide an option for a template-driven authoring. The CMS solution should also provide a facility to archive the Web site in such a way that it can be rolled back to earlier versions of the site and should have the capability of viewing a version of the Web site as of any given day.  A CMS software solution must be capable of running on the SUN Solaris Operating System.  Any CMS solution must be capable of pushing content to various Operating Systems including SUN Solaris.  Experience: At a minimum, respondents must have experience providing this service to other Government Agencies and/or large companies that have implemented their solution.  Respondents are asked to provide 3 references with similar requirements to what SSA is requesting, outline their capabilities, and explain how they would meet the needs of SSA. Please include a copy of your current GSA Schedule if services are available on Schedule, to the above address. This is not a request for quotations and requests for copies of a solicitation and/or telephone calls will not be honored or acknowledged.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this announcement.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any evaluation made from the information submitted.  No award will be made on the basis of this synopsis.  All responses are due by May 31, 2003.  No due date extensions from closing date will be granted.  You may fax information to the attention of the contract specialist at (410)966-5982 or email Cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes per individual email message.  The SSA requestor utilizes Microsoft Office XP format (or earlier) as the standard word processing software.  Respondents should refer to Reference Number SSA-03-WebCMS.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Microfluidic Electrophoresis System
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to enter into a single source contract with Caliper Technologies Corporation, Mountain View, California.  This contract is to procure the AMS 90 SE System, which is a chip-based, automated electrophoresis system for DNA fragment analysis, including software and a HT DNA 5000 SE 30 LabChip Kit.  This instrument will be used to determine size and quantity of DNA fragments ranging from 100 basepairs (bp) to 5000 bp in length; sampling directly from 96- or 384-well microtiter trays without operator interference (walk-away operation) using a proprietary "sipper" sample access system which eliminates pipetting errors associated with gel loading; and reports the results in a format compatible with Microsoft Excel.  This instrument also includes initial chip and reagents for approximately 2000 samples.  Analysis of fragments larger than 1000 bp is necessary for investigation of new, rapid microbial genotyping methods and confirmation of cloning constructs.  This instrument and its individual components are patented by Caliper.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

The Secretary of the Navy has determined that the illegal possession or use of drugs and paraphernalia in a military setting contributes directly to military drug abuse and undermines command efforts to eliminate drug abuse among military personnel.

Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulation issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.   5.  FAILURE TO PERFORM:  Should the contractor be unable to perform duties under this contract due to medical or physical disability for more than 13 consecutive days or because of questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct, performance under this contract may be suspended by the contracting officer until such medical or physical disability is resolved, or until such questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct have been resolved.
