<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source ELISA Kits
<SOLNBR>W81XWH-17-T-0053
<RESPDATE>121016
<CONTACT>James Cheng, Phone 3016191012, Email james.cheng1.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) to procure ELISA kits, antibodies, controls, and other miscellaneous related items without competition as prescribed in FAR 13.501(a)(1)(i). Specifically, the Government will procure these items manufactured by R&amp;D Systems.</p>
<p>USARIEM currently uses R&amp;D Systems products for analyses supporting multiple approved protocols (i.e., 14-07A, 14-08A, 16-03A, 16-08H). These analyses allow for the quantitation of proteins in tissue, plasma, and/or urine. In order to maintain continuity and compare data between experimental runs and among protocols it is necessary to purchase kits and antibodies from the same vendor. The specificity and uniqueness of ELISA kits and antibodies are such that they cannot be interchanged with those from other vendors.</p>
<p>The ELISA kits and antibodies are required to be from R&amp;D Systems for the continuity of ongoing studies and the integrity of the data collected. USARIEM currently has multiple protocols (i.e., 14-07A, 14-08A, 16-03A, 16-08H) that utilize ELISA kits and antibodies to analyze protein expression in tissue, plasma, and urine. Sample analyses for these protocols will be conducted for years following the data collection phases. For many of the protocols USARIEM maintains a sample depository from which samples can be tested for years and even decades after their collection. In order to compare data both within and across past, present and future studies it is required that the same kits and antibodies be used. This ensures that kits and antibodies are manufactured in the same facility, with the same reagents, with the same techniques and protocols, with the same equipment, and ultimately with the same specificity. This reduces variability between experimental procedures and thus produces good, reliable data. If ELISA kits and antibodies not manufactured by R&amp;D Systems were to be used, there would be a significant delay in study progress due to the time required to optimize and repeat analyses. In addition, optimization and repeat analyses would result in the loss of already limited samples.</p>
<p>The results of this work will provide data needed to fulfill requirements of multiple approved protocols. Protein analyses are an ongoing requirement and molecular mainstay for the study of environmental medicine, underlying molecular mechanisms, and any potential preventative or therapeutic interventions or treatments. R&amp;D Systems is the only source of the R&amp;D Systems kits and antibodies, as there are no authorized resellers.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516.</p>
<p>Proposed solicitation number: W81XWH-17-T-0053.</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to publish a solicitation no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the solicitation will be issued as brand name only.</p>
<p>All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to James Cheng at james.cheng1.civ@mail.mil. Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above email address listed above no later than 5:00 PM ET, 10 December 2016.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.<br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items with _____ days after date of contract award.<br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title: P-8A Aircraft Systems Procurement of Frame 500F Interference/Gap Kit
<p>Description(s): The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole source contract Task Order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-16-G-0001 to The Boeing Company to procure 16P-8A Aircraft Systems 500F Airframe Assembly Kits to correct frame station 500F Interference Gap.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to negotiate and award the contract utilizing other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority at FAR 6.3032-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>Pursuant to DFARS 206.302-1(d) and PGI 206.302, a sources sought notice was posted for this requirement.</p>
<p>This effort will address The Technical Directive for P-8, and the Service bulletin for P-8I modification for the 500F Interference/Gap.</p>
<p>The period of performance of this effort is anticipated from June 2017 through June 2018.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. NAVAIR synopsized the BOA to the government-wide point of entry (FedBizOpps website-www.fbo.gov) on 24 March 2015, and included a point of contact for subcontracting opportunities to broaden industry and small business participation. Though a formal market survey was not performed for the BOA, each order will be independently synopsized on www.fbo.gov in accordance with FAR 5.201, specifically stating the Government's intent and rationale to contract sole-source with Boeing. The Government will not consider any information submitted by interested parties in response to this Presolicitation notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly via Paige V. Bisset at (425)965-8077 or paige.v.bisset@boeing.com</p>

Basis for Award: Source selection process will be "Lowest-Priced, Technically-Acceptable."  Lowest priced proposal will be based upon the combined total cost for all bid items.  If available funding at time of receipt of proposals is not sufficient to award all line items in the bid schedule, the Service will make a determination on what line items are considered most desirable based upon available monies.  Lowest price for all proposals will then be evaluated based upon the total for those line items deemed most desirable to the Service.  If the lowest priced proposal is technically acceptable, award will be made and no other proposals evaluated.  If the lowest priced proposal is not technically acceptable, the Service will evaluate the next lowest priced proposal and so on until a proposal is identified to be technically acceptable.  In determining whether a proposal as technically acceptable, the Service will be asking for a technical proposal (not-to-exceed three pages) that specifies similar capability/experience in performing elements of work as described in the attached statement of work with details of work experience over the last 5 years that describe their experience with installing similar Supervisor Control and Data Acquisition (Scada) computer monitoring system software, as well as submission of up to three references (number of pages will not count towards the 3 page limit for the technical proposal submission) for past projects over the last five years that are similar in nature.

Such an exception must then be approved by the Government before the requested material may be used in this construction project.</p>
<p>ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: All responsible small business firms may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>All prospective offerors are also required to use the System for Award Management (SAM) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission. You may access SAM via the following URL, www.sam.gov. Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of SAM.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME ONLY AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 19 (NCO 19) Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center (RMAC) intends on procuring large animal transport and containment units for the Research Department at the Project Eagle Aurora VA Medical Center using Other than Full and Open Competition procedures. This requirement is for the custom manufacturing, delivery, set-up & installation of sixteen (16), Large Animal Pens & one (1), Large Animal Transport Cart.  These items are needed for the VA ECHCS Research, Large Animal Program for safe holding, movement & transfer of large animals.

UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

This requirement is being solicited from a single source in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) because of the urgent nature of this procurement.  If the VA is unable to get the Large Animal Cages and Transport Cart ordered immediately, there will be unacceptable delays in the completion and operational ability of the Research Lab, resulting in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. The suggested source, Britz & Company, is the only contractor able to satisfy the urgency of this requirement and prevent costly delays of the transition into the new Lab. 

These unique/specific items are custom fabricated, allowing for installation into rooms with a new construction layout.  Dimension of pens have been adjusted & will be custom fabricated to fit all locations. Current construction conditions will not allow for the procurement and installation of standard items. The layout of the rooms was specifically constructed with plumbing and HVAC locations designed around the pens Britz & Company are to provide.

In order to determine the construction design of these animal holding rooms and develop the requirements of this procurement, it was necessary for the contractor to conduct a site-visit and provide preliminary drawings. With consideration of an accelerated construction schedule and the additional lead times associated with finalizing detailed drawings, engineering, fabrication, delivery, and installation this system, it is necessary for the VA to place this order immediately.  

In addition to satisfying the urgent and compelling nature of this requirement, the following features are the standard of design for these housing units and are not provided by any other current manufacturer of animal cages for housing livestock in biomedical research facilities;

SWINE/DOG PENS
Custom Sizing: This is important to allow for maximum use of valuable spacing at the facility. Engineers are required to design around specific columns, trenches, and various other obstacles.
Bead Blasted Finish: This finish removes slag and covers weld areas, reducing glare from facility lights. Glare can cause stress to the animals which may alter research projects.
Round Tubing & Strength: Provides a smooth surface for animals to rub against. Pigs have natural behavioral instincts to  root  and rub on objects.The framing tube sections are seal welded to prevent entry of moisture, vermin, and microorganisms to the inside of the framework.
Elevated Flooring & Adjustable Legs: Allows the units to be lifted for various reasons such as small slopes in flooring, cleaning processes or as needed. In turn elevated flooring is healthier for animals as they are not lying directly on cold flooring or in their waste. This type of flooring has fine grit for added safety for both animals and care givers; it is considered thermo-neutral.

CUSTOM CARTS
Removable Top & Sliding Doors: Special design for easy access to animals through the top. Includes sliding doors on both sides and one end.
Specialized Ramp: Integrated in one end for ease in use.
The transport cart will be made of the same material as the pens, at the same height as each pen to ensure safe transport & transfer of large animals 
Composite Panels:Quiet and thermo-neutral.
DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Even with the extraordinary circumstances described above, an abbreviated  Brand Name Only  competition amongst distributors or partners of Britz & Company was contemplated; however, BH, Inc. (Britz & Company) provided in writing that they are the sole manufacturer and do not use distributors. 

This vendor is currently used by the Denver VA and meets all facility and animal holding facility code requirements for fabrication & installation into the provided construction area. Research found that the Britz & Company units meet, or exceed, all requirements of the National Institutes of Health; Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Revised 2011. 

The VA acknowledge the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system and are committed to working in manner that promotes competition to the greatest extent practicable in order to compete future requirements and overcome barriers to competition.. The VA Research Department has and will continue to meet with industry experts, as well as the VA Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center, for identifying opportunities to compete future requirements.
