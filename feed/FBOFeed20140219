<DESC>The Digital Thread for Material Review Board (MRB) Processes program aims to link design and production data and analyses within integrated software tools to feed the MRB decision-making process. The program will utilize standard data formats and will integrate/enhance commercially available software tools. In addition to the development of MRB process improvement technologies, a comprehensive solution is sought to (a) link production data to design activities to reduce the frequency of and to streamline MRBs, and (b) utilize production data to establish a non-proprietary, primitive digital surrogate of key aircraft components/assemblies which have passed through MRBs. Outside the scope of this solicitation, future work will extend tools and performance predictions further into the operational lifecycle of USAF systems and extend these capabilities to non-MRB components/systems.

The following Federal Holidays are observed: <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractor'?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>The prime contractor is responsible for security badges and/or protective masks issued to their employees and/or employees of their subcontractor(s).  A designated representative (being an officer or supervisor of the prime contractor) shall co-sign for each individual when obtaining the required item(s). Additionally, the contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer or the appointed Contracting Officer?'s Representative (COR) a list of employees requiring masks/badges under the awarded contract prior to initiation of work.  The Contractor shall be required to submit a ?certificate of return? for all masks/badges from the cognizant office(s), to the Contracting Officer or the COR.  For item(s) not returned, the replacement cost of the items will be deducted from the invoice or the Contractor will be invoiced if the replacement cost exceeds the amount due the Contractor. <BR> <BR>(a)	In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b)	To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements.  To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c)	If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

The methodology of the assessments is to ensure that assessment items are valid and reliable, developed in consultation with appropriate technical experts in measurement and assessment, content and subject matter, sampling, and other technical experts who engage in large scale assessment programs.<br />&nbsp;
<p><strong>NAEP Achievement Levels<br /></strong>The Governing Board's legislative mandate is of significant importance, particularly since achievement levels are the primary means for reporting NAEP results. The achievement levels represent an informed judgment of "how good is good enough" and help explain results of The Nation's Report Card beyond simple scores and averages. They also provide the basis for gauging trends in each subject and grade assessed by NAEP. The NAEP achievement levels identify the knowledge and skills that can be measured and verified objectively using widely accepted professional assessment standards. They are also required to be consistent with relevant widely accepted professional assessment standards and be&nbsp;based on the appropriate level of subject matter knowledge for grade levels to be assessed, or the age of the students.<br /><br />The three achievement levels established by the Governing Board -- Basic, Proficient, and Advanced -- are the primary means of communicating about the performance of students on The Nation's Report Cards. Achievement levels have been set for reading, mathematics, writing, science, U.S. history, geography, civics, and economics. Reports on achievement levels reports can be found at the Governing Board's website, specifically at http://www.nagb.org/publications/achievement.html. Additional background on the Board's history of setting achievement levels may be found at http://www.nagb.org/publications/achievement.html.<br /><br />While the Board's achievement level setting methodologies have improved over the years, there is a unique need to develop state-of-the-art methods for this next generation of NAEP assessments. All new NAEP assessments will now be computer-based. Setting achievement levels on these computer-based, innovative NAEP assessments will require the Board to study, develop, and implement innovative standard setting methodologies to address the challenging issues presented by the innovative item types expected on new computer-based tests.<br /><br /><strong>The NAEP TEL Assessment<br /></strong>The 2014 NAEP TEL assessment is a completely computer-based assessment. Student performance&nbsp;will be assessed through scenario-based tasks and discrete items. The Governing Board intends to incorporate computerized methods in the achievement level-setting process. The operational assessment for grade 8 will be administered in 2014, and data will be available for the achievement levels-setting work by September 2014.<br /><br />The 2014 NAEP Technology and Engineering Literacy Framework and the Test Specifications adopted by the Governing Board, are available on the Governing Board's website at http://www.nagb.org/publications/frameworks/technology/2014-technology-framework.html. <br /><br />Preliminary achievement levels descriptions for each assessment area (Technology and Society; Design and Systems; and Information and Communication Technology) were developed as part of the Technology and Engineering Literacy Framework development project. The Governing Board commissioned an issues paper to inform the TEL standard setting process by identifying&nbsp;technical and policy issues which could have a substantive impact on the process of setting the achievement levels. Since this assessment is not only a computer-based test (CBT), but has been developed using evidence-centered design (ECD), the Board sought a review of various standard-setting elements, as well as&nbsp;insights into other extant standard setting methodologies that are linked to ECD. The issues paper is available on the website as well at http://www.nagb.gov/publications/reports-papers/achievement-levels/2014-naep-achievement-levels.html. <br /><br />The Governing Board is currently in the process of conducting expert evaluation of the preliminary achievement levels descriptions in order to develop final descriptions for use in the achievement levels setting process conducted under the contract. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Request for Proposals<br /></strong>The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued under full and open competition, no later than 30 days from this notice.&nbsp; Proposals will be due 45 days after the RFP is released. The award is anticipated to be a hybrid type contract with labor costs awarded on a Firm Fixed Price Basis and Other Direct Costs awarded on a cost reimbursement basis.&nbsp;The contract award is projected to be made prior to September 30, 2014. The period of performance is anticipated to be approximately 14 months.<br /><br />All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice, provide capability statements (not exceeding 2 pages),&nbsp;and submit feedback on the proposed solicitation. All timely responses received shall be considered by the Governing Board. Information on the Governing Board's work can be found at www.nagb.gov.<br /><br />Questions and comments on this notice may be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Munira Mwalimu, by Tuesday, February 28th, 10 a.m. EST at Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov. Responses will be posted approximately five working days after receipt.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)  <br> Refrigerated Chef Base (two draw refrigerator)  <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION:  <br>  <br> The DoD Combat Feeding Directorate is planning to conduct a research effort to procure; test and document the performance of a refrigerated chef based two draw refrigerator for Navy shipboard application.  The appliance must be capable of supporting and fastening a four foot griddle on top of the unit.  <br> The refrigerated chef base research effort is planned to be conducted by the DoD Combat Feeding Directorate (CFD), Systems Equipment and Engineering Team (SEET). <br> This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes and is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the Natick Solider Research development and Engineering Command (NSRDEC) Combat Feeding Program. Responses to this RFI are optional. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NSRDEC will take procurement action in this matter. Neither NSRDEC nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. <br>  <br> GENERAL BACKGROUND:  <br>  <br> Many Navy food service operations rely heavily on the griddle and reach-in refrigerators for food preparation during peak meal hours. Currently, the Navy uses two separate appliances for the refrigeration and grilling of food items aboard ships, a reach-in refrigerator and a griddle.   The location of the reach-in refrigerators in comparison to the griddle locations facilitates the cook having to leave the griddle to obtain more food product to prepare for their patrons.   The combination of a two draw refrigerator installed under the griddle offers the ability for less movement throughout the kitchen by the cooks, and lessens the time that patrons wait for their food product in the serving line. <br>  <br> A dual functional appliance suite is a versatile piece of food service equipment that combines the capability to cook and refrigerate within the same footprint in the kitchen.  Additionally, the modular appliance can save space within the confines of shipboard kitchens. <br>  <br>  <br> OPERATIONAL CONCEPT: <br>  <br> The Griddle/2-draw refrigerator will be used aboard Navy ships. In order to be utilized on a ship, the appliance must be modular and able to fit through a 26 x 66 standard shipboard hatch. To accomplish this, the appliance must be modular and put together on-site without welding.  <br>  <br>  <br> SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST: <br>  <br> The refrigerated two draw appliance is expected to meet the majority of the current refrigeration performance requirements as well as some additional characteristics/capabilities as listed below: <br> National Sanitation Foundation and UL approved <br> Ozone Depleting Chemicals: The refrigerant shall be commercially available, <br> non-ozone depleting.  Class I or class II ozone-depleting substances, as <br> determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), shall not be <br> contained in, and shall be prohibited from use during the fabrication of the <br> refrigeration system. <br>  <br> Ozone Depleting Chemicals Inspection and Certification:  Visually check the <br> list of prohibited Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances on the <br> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website.  The systems shall not <br> contain or be manufactured with any of these substances.  The contractor <br> shall provide certification to meeting the EPA requirement listed in Section <br> 3.  The contractor shall certify the refrigerant charge quantity on the <br> refrigeration data plate. <br>  <br> Power Requirement: 115V, 50/60 Hz  <br> Rugged to withstand the six degrees of motion encountered in a shipboard environment; three translations (surge, sway and heave), and three rotations (roll, pitch and yaw). <br> The two draw appliance must be able to remain operable on a 15 degree incline and undamaged on a 45 incline <br> Able to accommodate four to six full-size hotel pans  20 X 12 1/2 four-inch deep hotel pans or twelve half-size hotel pans. <br> Easy to clean- 304 Stainless steel interior and exterior <br> Include self-diagnostics and digital controls for temperature monitoring <br> The appliance must be able to fit through a 26x 66 diameter hatch <br> Front accessibility for operation, performance of all maintenance, and repair <br> Doors must have positive latching mechanisms in the closed positions <br> The appliance must operate within safe levels of radiated and conducted electromagnetic interference, as defined by MIL-STD-461. <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423740. <br>  <br> The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 5078. <br>  <br> Inquiries and responses may be sent to Louis Jamieson, via email at louis.r.jamieson.civ@mail.mil no later than March 7, 2014, 5:00 PM (EST). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>***NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS RFI***</p>
<p>1.0	Purpose of this RFI<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information from interested vendors for the Joint Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System JCCQAS project.</p>
<p>2.0	Background<br />The JCCQAS project is to develop and map Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements, prepare the environment, and develop a prototype system to enable DoD and VA to uniformly manage a single interagency system.</p>
<p><br />3.0	Existing Applications<br />The JCCQAS application will use the existing Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS) as the foundation for the future interagency system which the DoD and VA will use for all credentialing and privileging activities.  CCQAS is a mature platform currently used by all Army, Navy and Air Force medical treatment facilities.  Because the existing CCQAS (DoD) technical solution is not scalable and does not have the technical capacity to accommodate the large number of records associated with an interagency system, the CCQAS environment will be prepared (converting existing CCQAS code base from classic Active Server Page (ASP) code into .NET) to support the JCCQAS prototype.</p>

<a href="mailto:justin.d.ruth.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>Sources sought to provide the government with the MX-10130D and MX- 11769 image intensifier tubes. The image intensifier tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low light conditions such as at night. The image intensifier tubes are used in conjunction with the following Night-Vision devices: AN/PVS -14, Monocular Night Vision Device and AN/PVS-7B/D Night Vision Goggles.  The Government requires an estimated quantity of greater than 12,000 for MX-10130D and greater than 41,000 for MX-11769, over a 5 year period. The Government possesses a complete technical data package, including a specification and detailed drawings, for the image intensifier tubes. Due to the sensitive nature of these items, contractors must demonstrate to the government the ability to acquire or manufacture MX-10130D and MX-11769 prior to the technical data package being provided. This is not a solicitation.  This is only an estimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.   <br>  <br> At present, there are only two (2) qualified government suppliers for the MX-10130D and MX-11769 image intensifier.  Please note to successfully support the warfighter these image intensifier tubes must perform at the level identified in the performance specification.  For this reason, the Government will include a clause that permits the Government to seek consideration from the awardee in the event of failure.  This will be required whether the contractor is a manufacturer or a distributor.  The calculation included within the consideration clause is as follows: <br>  <br> Damages = ((MTTF Required - MTTF Demonstrated) * units in lot * cost per unit)/MTTF Required <br>  <br> *MTTF - Mean Time to Failure is 10,000 as detailed in the performance specifications <br>  <br> In the event, the Government observes a failure rate of ten percent for these items, the consideration calculation will be applied as follows:  The example assumes a lot of 1,000 units priced at $2,000 per unit experiences a MTTF of 9,000 hours (10% below the MTTF required), the damages calculation would be as follows: <br>  <br> Damages = ((10,000 - 9,000) * 1,000 * $2,000))/10,000 = $200,000 <br>  <br> Suppliers who are capable of delivery of these items, in accordance with the government data package and in the quantities specified above, should contact the government before 7 March 2014. Submissions can be sent to Justin.Ruth@DLA.mil .  Responses must include documentation that contains the following:  (1) the contractor must provide information to show that he possesses, or shall possess, adequate production plant facilities (equipment, tooling, and space) to enable him, or his subcontractors, to produce these item; (2) identification of the contractor as a Large or a Small Business;  (3) the contractor shall submit their part numbers, NSN, or nomenclature and the date of the last manufacturing effort of the same or similar items for which they have production experience; (4)  Government contract numbers, if applicable, shall be provided; (5) The contractor shall cite the quality standard (either Government or Industry) that shall be in place for this effort; and (6) if the contractor is a distributor, a statement detailing the value that will be adding to the acquisition by the contractor must be provided.  For more information, please contact Justin Ruth at Justin.Ruth@DLA.MIL or (443)-861-4536. <br>

<DESC>NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing this Community Announcement for a Draft Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Discovery Program missions by May 2014. The Discovery Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMDs planetary programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap. It is anticipated that approximately two to three Discovery investigations will be selected for nine-month, $3M (RY) Phase A concept studies through this AO. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned that one Discovery investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. There will be no Missions of Opportunity (MO) solicited as part of this AO. All MOs are now solicited through the Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity Notice (SALMON) AO. <p> Discovery Program investigations must address NASAs planetary science objectives as described in 2014 NASA Strategic Plan and the 2014 NASA Science Plan. Both of these documents will be publicly released following the submission of the FY 2015 budget to Congress. <p> Investigations may focus on any body in the Solar System, excluding the Earth and the Sun. Investigations may not focus on the identification or characterization of extra-solar planetary systems. <p> Discovery Program investigations may propose activities that have the potential to broaden the scientific impact of investigations as optional Science Enhancement Options (SEOs). SEOs include, but are not limited to, guest investigator programs, general observer programs, participating scientist programs, interdisciplinary scientist programs, and archival data analysis programs.	Discovery Program investigations may also propose Technology Demonstration Opportunities (TDOs) to demonstrate new capabilities. TDO proposals, like Science Enhancement Opportunities (SEOs), are funded outside of the cost cap and may possibly not be selected even if the parent mission is selected for flight. <p> Discovery Program investigations involving entry, descent, and landing (EDL) into the atmosphere of a Solar System object (including the Earth) shall include an Engineering Science Activity, to be funded outside of the cost cap, to obtain diagnostic and technical data about vehicle performance and entry environments. Details of the goals and objectives of this activity will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition Website (discovery.larc.nasa.gov) in the Program Library. <p> The schedule for fueling of radioisotope power systems (RPSs) cannot be met in time for the expected launch window of Discovery 2014 investigations. Therefore, Discovery Program investigations may not propose the use of RPSs. Proposed investigations may include the use of radioactive sources for science instruments and the use of radioisotope heater units (RHUs). <p> NASA is considering providing additional technologies as Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE). Currently under consideration is a commercially produced version of the NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) ion propulsion system (two flight model power processing units and two thrusters). Also under consideration is the Heat Shield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET)  a woven Thermal Protection System. <p> NASA is also considering requiring all investigations to carry a Deep Space Laser Communications (DSLO) package, to be provided as GFE. Given the success of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer mission, a demonstration of laser communications from deep space is a high priority for NASA. <p> Decisions on the three technologies described above, or any other technologies (e.g., Deep Space Atomic Clock, Advanced Solar Arrays), will be made before the release of a draft AO. <p> Launch Vehicle costs and procurement will be the responsibility of NASA. Launch vehicle standard services will be provided as GFE and the cost will not be included in the cost cap. The cost of mission specific and special launch services, including the use of radioisotope heating units (RHUs), is the responsibility of the PI and must be included within the cost cap. NASA is reviewing the possibility of offering options for different launch vehicle capabilities and their impact on the cost cap. <p> The constraint that the value of foreign contributions must not exceed one-third of the PI-Managed Mission Cost has been modified: the total value of foreign contributions may still not exceed one-third of the PI-Managed Mission Cost and the value of foreign contributions to the science payload may not exceed one-third of the total payload cost. <p> Investigations are capped at a Phase A-D cost of $450M (FY 2015), excluding standard launch services. The now-standard 25% minimum reserve on Phases A-D will be required within the cost cap. Operations costs (Phase E) are not included in the cost cap, but will be evaluated for reasonableness. Lower-cost investigations and cost-efficient operations are encouraged. <p> The time frame for the solicitation is intended to be: <p> Release of draft AO	 May 2014 (target) Release of final AO	 September 2014 (target) Preproposal conference	 ~3 weeks after final AO release Proposals due	 90 days after AO release Selection for competitive Phase A studies	 May 2015 (target) Concept study reports due	 April 2016 (target) Down-selection	 October 2016 (target) Launch readiness date	 NLT December 31, 2021 <p> The Draft Discovery AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template available at <A HREF="http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html">http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/ standardao/sao_templates.html </A>    . Proposers should read the Draft Discovery AO carefully when it is released. <p> NASA has not approved the issuance of the Discovery AO and this notification does not obligate NASA to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this notification or the planned Draft Discovery AO are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk. <p> Further information will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition Page at <A HREF="http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/as">http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/as </A>	  it becomes available. Questions may be addressed to   Dr. Michael New, Discovery Program Lead Scientist, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC	20546; Tel.: (202) 358-1766; Email: michael.h.new@nasa.gov. <p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing robust, current, and applicable news and information regarding federal procurement policies, regulations, best practices, training, and other topics related to federal procurement in order to build, maintain and expand the knowledge and skills of the NIST acquisition workforce. The target audience at NIST would include, but not be limited to, Contracting Officers, Contract Specialists, Purchasing Agents, Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs), and Program Managers. <br />The primary goal of this requirement would be to award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for software licenses or entity memberships which would enable NIST to receive access to real-time news and information regarding current acquisition issues, regulations and policies. The information could be provided via a well-organized and easily accessible website, via information "pushed" to the prospective users by e-mail, via an App that would be easily accessible through a mobile device (cell-phone, tablet, laptop, etc.), or any combination of these or other reasonable methodologies.<br />NIST is anticipating awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for approximately 25 users at NIST for a one-year Pilot Program.<br />In addition to the types of information described above, NIST also seeks access to web-based procurement training modules in order to supplement the current training available to the NIST staff. All training offered must be FAC-C and/or FAC-COR compliant in order to be considered as Continuous Learning Points (CLPs) towards maintaining appropriate certification levels of the acquisition workforce. Interested offerors are requested to provide a list of available courses and a brief description of each course, including the number of CLPs available by course. <br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 611430, as those domestic sources&nbsp;earning $7.0M&nbsp;or less annually. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that provide the services described herein are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill @nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. <br />The report should include information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that provides the services for which information is provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to provide the services, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such services. 4. Indication of whether the services are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5.

<CONTACT>Patricia Campbell, Contracting Officer, Phone 2155212278, Email patricia.r.campbell@hq.dhs.gov - Marcus Mason, Contract Specialist, Phone 8176496224, Email marcus.l.mason@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>Inventory, Analysis, and Program Management Support of FPS Security Countermeasures.
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information-gathering and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) or a promise to issue a RFP or RFQ in the future. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is seeking to determine if there are any vendors capable of performing inventory, analysis, and providing program management support for security countermeasures owned or managed by the Federal Protective Service (FPS). The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />FPS is responsible for protecting approximately 9,600 Federal facilities nationwide (including Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands). <br />This requirement supports the FPS in providing integrated asset management for eleven (11) Regions and a Headquarters component. Such an integrated approach to managing these resources will help the organization to overcome challenges rooted in existing infrastructure and in siloed and/or disconnected systems. Further, by breaking down multiple silos of non-standard, non-integrated systems, this approach will assist with aligning regional operations with business objectives. It can also support long and short-term planning, inventory control, enable preventive and condition-based maintenance, and assist the organization in making essential countermeasure recommendations. <br />These analyses are necessary in order for FPS to manage risk and strengthen security resilience at FPS protected facilities. This will allow the organization to systematically coordinate activities and practices, and sustainably manage its countermeasure assets, systems, performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />FPS has identified the need for all security countermeasures to be inventoried and the results and the data collected during the inventory populated into an Asset Management System that can easily interface with the DHS Sunflower Asset Management System for the purpose of inventory and life cycle management. As part of this requirement the contractor will be required to:<br />Conduct physical inventory of FPS and/or GSA owned/managed security countermeasures; Agency owned countermeasures at FPS protected facilities; Conduct assessment of countermeasure operability; Assess where the countermeasure is in its current life-cycle and make a predictive statement/assessment of its future operability. All results shall be documented in a manner that can be easily/electronically updated and/or populated into the DHS Sunflower Asset Management System (SAMS).</p>
<p>&bull;Inventory: This includes but is not limited to Conducting physical inventory and identify make, model and serial number on all FPS and/or GSA owned/managed security countermeasures at approximately 9,600 FPS protected facilities. The following countermeasures shall be inventoried:<br /><br />- CCV Systems and components (Cameras, Digital Video Recorders / VCRs, Monitors and Multiplexers/Switches) CCV (closed-circuit television) is a TV system in which signals are not publicly distributed but are monitored, primarily for surveillance and security purposes. CCV relies on strategic placement of cameras and private observation of the camera's input on TV monitors. The system is called "closed-circuit" because the cameras, monitors and/or video recorders communicate across a proprietary coaxial cable, fiber-optic run or wireless communication link. Access to data transmissions is limited by design. CCV systems may include multiplexers that allows for multiple cameras being monitored at once on the same TV monitor. CCV systems may use a either Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and/or Video Cassette Recorder (VCRs) to record areas where cameras are pointed. <br /><br />- Mechanical (Retractable) / Fixed / Removable Security Bollards. Security Bollards embedded in concrete substrate around a building's perimeter that physically prevent vehicles from entering restricted or protected areas. <br /><br />- Mechanical (Retractable/Wedge Plate) / Fixed / Removable Security Barriers. Security Barriers physically prevent vehicles from entering restricted or protected areas. They are usually the last line of defense in a roadway, garage entrance or vehicle access point. The most commonly employed barriers are designed to stop a 15,000 pound vehicle traveling 50 miles per hours with no penetration. Barriers can be either "open or closed-loop" hydraulic or electric. <br /><br />- Mechanical / Manual Security Gates. These types of gates are either worm-driven swing or sliding and they are either electrometrical or hydraulic. These gates are normally installed to control vehicle assess to outdoor parking areas in and around Federal facilities. <br /><br />- Mechanical Drop Arm / Crash Beam Barrier. These types of barriers can be operated electromechanically, hydraulically or manually. They are normally used at vehicle access points with an arm that raises and lowers vertically, or rotates horizontally to allow or deny vehicle access. <br /><br />- Ballistic Shields/Podiums at Protective Security Officer Posts. These are bullet proof furniture type items used in entryways at Federal facilities.<br /><br />- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) (Including Both Management and Reporting Consoles). A type of security system that gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or network to identify possible security breaches, which include both intrusions and misuse.<br /><br />- Automated Access Control Systems (AACS). Either an electronic or electromechanical system used to authorize movement of personnel, vehicles, or materials through entrances and exits at Federal facilities.<br /><br />- Duress/Panic Alarm Systems. A wire or wireless alarm system used in alerting somebody in emergency situations where a threat to persons or property exists.<br /><br />- X-Ray Machines. Used to screen packages at entry/exit points at Federal facilities.<br /><br />- Walk Through Metal Detectors (Magnetometers). Used to screen personnel via a walk-through device at entry/exit points at Federal facilities.<br /><br />- Hand Held Metal Detectors (Wands). Used to physically screen individuals who require secondary inspection.</p>
<p>&bull; Assessment of Countermeasures: Conduct assessment of current countermeasure operability including but not limited to systems and individual system components. The assessment will determine where the existing equipment is in its current life-cycle and make a predictive statement/assessment of its future operability.</p>

<DESC><div>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a National Laboratory and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) operated by Princeton University under contract to the United States Department of Energy, desires to obtain expressions of interest from offerors who wish to provide all labor, material and equipment necessary to perform Phase I research and development and physics and engineering design tasks for the Sensors and Data Acquisition and Analysis Software for the ITER Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angle Viewing System in accordance with Statement of Work (SOW) #US ITER 1050301-PD0004, Revision 0, dated February 12, 2014 (attached to this announcement). It is PPPL's intention to include an option in any resulting subcontract for performance of Phase II tasks for fabrication, assembly, test and preparation for shipping to the ITER site in Cadarache, France. Because of the significant technical uncertainties inherent in the design, development and production of visible and infrared imaging instrumentation such as the Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angle Viewing System, it is not feasible to perform Phase I of the statement of work using a firm-fixed-price type contractual arrangement. Therefore, PPPL expects to issue either a cost reimbursement (no fee) type subcontract to an academic institution, or a cost-plus-fixed fee type subcontract to a for-profit concern for the Phase I work, depending on the leadership structure of the successful proposal team. Interested parties&nbsp;are encouraged to&nbsp;review&nbsp;the attached SOW and its reference documents, then&nbsp;send an email to the Mr. Chi Man Cheung, RFP Coordinator, at the&nbsp; address provided in this announcement. Those parties expressing interest will be notified when the Request for Proposals is available for download from the PPPL Procurement web site at &nbsp;http://procurement.pppl.gov/Procurement%20Opportunities.HTM. This announcement shall not commit PPPL to issue a subcontract for this effort, or to pay any costs incurred by offerors in the preparation and submittal of&nbsp;expressions of interest&nbsp;in response to this announcement.&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>This Pre-solicitation Notice announce that the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is proposing to negotiate a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with Apatite to Zircon, Inc. (A2Z ) on a sole-source basis, for an annual sample analysis This BPA will include a base year and 4 one year optional periods. The USGS has concluded that these services are available from A2Z. The reason justifying this lack of competition is based on the following description of specific qualifications the Government requires from the service to meet its minimum needs, and the factors the Government will use to evaluate the service information by firms in response to this notice:
The USGS Eastern Energy Resources Science Center (EERSC) has an ongoing requirement for mineral separation, fission track, and U-Pb geochronologic analysis of apatites and zircons as a part of the Alaska Petroleum Geology Project, the Gulf of Mexico Petroleum Geology project, and possibly other projects conducted by the USGS EERSC. Fission track and U-Pb geochronologic measurements are routine elements of basin analysis studies, and USGS scientists are in the midst of ongoing research efforts that are designed, in part, to exploit these analytical tools. In particular, these measurements have been collected over the past 3-5 fiscal years for the Alaska project, and they will continue to be an integral component of USGS work over the next several fiscal years (3-5 yrs). The exact number of samples varies from year to year, and largely depends on sample accessibility during field campaigns in remote regions and will be determined by quantities, funding, period of performance, and any other variables in separate task orders. Generally, we anticipate collecting approximately 5 - 20 fission track samples per year, and 5 - 10 U-Pb samples per year, and each sample requires mineral separation work prior to analytical work. For some subset of samples, both fission track and U-Pb geochronologic analysis is performed, a technique known as double dating of single zircon grains.
In order to be responsive to this Notice, a firm must provide the appropriate capability statement for consideration no later than 15 days after the date of this notice. Responses that do not comply with these procedures will not be considered.
Requests for information and subsequent responses may be emailed or mailed to the point-of-contact specified below. Firms are cautioned that this is not a solicitation. All costs associated with providing information as requested by this Notice shall be the responsibility of the responding firm.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for a Maintenance Dredging Project located in Guilford, CT.  This announcement is to determine the interest, availability, and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns as described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The project is scheduled to be issued for bid on or about June 23, 2014.  The construction is scheduled to occur in the fall and winter of 2014-15 and is expected to take 10 to 12 weeks to complete.  The estimated construction cost is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00 <br> 	 <br> The proposed project involves maintenance dredging of the Congressionally-authorized Federal Navigation Project (FNP) located in Guilford Harbor, Guilford, CT.  The authorized project includes a navigation channel 6 feet deep below mean lower low water (MLLW) and 100 feet wide extending approximately 6000 lineal feet from the confluence of the East and Neck Rivers out into Guilford Harbor.  The dredging work will include the main FNC, an anchorage located in the East River, approximately 100 feet by 1500 feet,  and the 55 foot wide, 800 feet long Sluice Creek Channel which connects the Guilford marina to the main FNC.  In addition to these areas, the Town of Guilford marina will also be dredged.  Dredging the marina will require the removal and replacement of all water-based marina components including the following: 46 dock sections (6 feet x 20 feet), 58 finger piers (2 feet x 17 feet), water and electrical services to all docks, and the removal and replacement of approximately 62 12-inch diameter timber piles ranging in length from 30-40 feet.  The marina components will be stored in the town-owned parking lot adjacent to the marina while the marina is dredged. Approximately 60,000 total cubic yards of sandy material will be dredged from the main channel, anchorage, Sluice Creek, and marina.   A mechanical dredge using various types of clamshell buckets will remove material from the shoaled portions of the Guilford Harbor FNC and marina and then place it into scows.  The scows will then be towed to Central Disposal Area in Long Island Sound where the dredge spoils will be discharged for final disposal.  It is anticipated that all work will be completed in approximately 10 to 12 weeks and will be executed during the dredge window of October 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015. <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business), type of equipment to be used, as well as qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects involving dredging of similar size and nature and completed within the last 5 years.  Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should include experience of foreman and dredge operators working on mechanical dredge projects.  Proof of bonding capability is also required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should be emailed to Susan Dunnagan at Susan.K.Dunnagan@usace.army.mil.  Contact her at 978-318-8060 with questions.  Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.   <br>

<a href="mailto:susan.k.dunnagan@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Repairs to the East Jetty at Block Island Harbor of refuge, Block Island, Rhode Island to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  Work is expected to begin in October 2014 and all work, including site restoration, must be completed by March 31, 2015.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> Block Island Harbor of Refuge is located on the east side of Block Island, RI about 13 miles southwest of Point Judith Harbor, Rhode Island, and about 25 miles southeast of Stonington Harbor, Connecticut.  The proposed work involves repairing those sections of the east breakwater that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 and will involve mobilizing heavy construction equipment, large armor stone, and other project materials to Block Island by water. <br>   <br> The repair work will involve reconstructing the breakwater to pre-storm conditions including side slopes and crest height.  Although equipment and materials will be delivered to the site via water, it is expected that the repair work will be largely conducted from the crest and within the foot-print of the existing structure.  The quantity of stone to be placed is currently estimated to include approximately 2400 tons.  A fairly large amount of displaced stone is expected to be recovered from the site adjacent to the breakwater, especially near the trunk and head of the structure.  New stone will also be required and that stone will be brought from offsite sources. The existing stone size of the structure varies widely and new stone needed to repair the structure is expected to range in size on the trunk (middle) from 10-14 tons and on the head (tip) from 18-22 tons.   Various sections of the breakwater will require  quote mark dismantling quote mark  prior to rebuilding with new stone so that pre-storm elevations and side slopes can be matched and the very large armor stone can be properly aligned and interlocked.  Work is expected to commence just after October 1, 2014 and be completed NLT March 31, 2015.   <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects involving construction/repair of similar massive stone structures such as seawalls, stone breakwaters, and jetties. Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should also include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on massive stone structures. Subcontractors may be used to demonstrate this past experience.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses should be emailed to Susan Dunnagan at Susan.K.Dunnagan@usace.army.mil.  Contact her at 978-318-8060 with questions.   Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.

<SOLNBR>RBM45-RFI
<RESPDATE>031914
<CONTACT>Kelly A. Wyatt, Phone 410-762-6472, Email Kelly.A.Wyatt@uscg.mil
<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY! This is NOT a request for formal proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract as a result of any information received. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to gain knowledge of potential power generation system retrofit options for the RB-M 45' boats.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates 125 RB-M boats with an anticipated final fleet size of 170 boats. The RB-M is manufactured by Marinette Marine Corporation based in Marinette, Wisconsin. Present USCG plans call for the operation of a 170 boat for a fleet total of approximately 102,000 operational hours per year (204,000 combined system hours based on a twin generator system configuration), however, end state fleet size remains under review.<br /><br />The USCG RB-M boat is based on the Double Chine Deep V CAMARC LTD/KVICHAK Hull Design. These USCG RB-M boats are operated differently from commercial boat operation of similar configuration in that they support USCG Search and Rescue (SAR) and Law Enforcement missions in an off-shore and heavy weather environment. USCG RB-M missions require frequent and sustained operation in higher sea states, variable propulsion loading situations including long periods of idling and increased cycling of all working components including but not limited to all control surfaces. These environments and severe performance requirements accelerate failure of all related systems and components of the boat including electronics and power generation components.<br /><br />Electrical power is supplied by two AuraGen <sup>TM</sup> power generation systems. The AuraGen <sup>TM</sup> power generation system consists of:<br /><br />1) AuraGen <sup>TM</sup> Viper G8500X induction power source (IPS)<br />2) Electronic Control Unit/Inverter Charging System (ECU/ICS)<br />3) ICS control panel <br />
<p>The IPS is an induction power unit that is mounted to at the front of each DETRIOT DIESEL MTU SERIES 60 Six Cylinder, Four Stroke engine. Each IPS is belt-driven through the diesel engine crank shaft, and is rated at 8.5 kW. The IPS provides AC power to the ECU/ICS for conditioning and distribution to the AC and DC power distribution systems. The ECU/ICS provides a regulated 24 VDC for battery charge and the DC power distribution system.<br /><br />The Coast Guard has experienced higher than anticipated mean time between failure (MTBF) rates for power generation system components (IPS and ECU/ICS), including associated repair costs and parts availability issues which have necessitated this study to identify potential power generation system retrofit options.<br /><br />Objective:<br /><br />The USCG is seeking information from sources who can provide technical, budgetary, and schedule information for potential RB-M Non-Developmental Item (NDI) boat waterjet propulsion systems retrofit solutions that comply with all FAR and CFR requirements. The information obtained will be used to develop a strategy to maximize operational effectiveness and minimize total ownership cost of the Coast Guard's RB-M fleet. Responders should provide the following:<br /><br />&bull; Relevant information on the potential integrated power generation system retrofit options.<br />&bull; A preliminary higher level power generation system specification and a description of its integration in the RB-M boat<br />&bull; A clear identification of where the proposed power generation system is presently being used in actual operational conditions, or if the respondent has an alternative system for consideration that is not in true actual operational use, then the respondent may describe the system and must clearly indicate its actual developmental status<br />&bull; Budgetary information to include total ownership cost (including all recurring and non-recurring costs) for the integrated power generation system.<br /><br />The integrated power generation system must enable the modified boat to meet or exceed the existing boat performance as described in the 45FT Response Boat-Medium (RB-M) Operator's Handbook Manual (COMDTINST M16114.41). The integrated power generation system must be durable, supportable, maintainable and designed to cope with the specific performance requirements, operational environment and capable of supporting all existing equipment including, but not limited to, the power generation, electrical distribution, and battery systems.<br /><br />Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with this RFI. The Government shall not pay for this information. All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential and will not be returned nor shared outside this Agency. Additionally, the Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Small Boat Product Line (SBPL) encourages potential respondents to give presentations, provide their solutions, or gather feedback at our facility. The RB-M boat can be made available for inspection and evaluation of integration details provided an appointment is made with the Product Line Manager or his designated representative.<br /><br />Applicable Documents:<br /><br />&bull; 45FT Response Boat-Medium (RB-M) Operator's Handbook Manual, COMDTINST M16114.41<br />&bull; To obtain a copy of COMDTINST M16114.41, submit a request to Alexandra.K.Cherry@uscg.mil and Kelly.A.Wyatt@uscg.mil.<br /><br />All interested parties shall provide their Points of Contact, DUNS Number, Small Business Classification, lists of any pertinent GSA Schedules or DHS Contract Vehicles including TABSS, and the applicable NAICS and Product Service Codes.<br /><br />Replies:<br /><br />Responses to this RFI shall be emailed to LT Alexandra Cherry, SFLC PDM Branch Chief, at Alexander.K.Cherry@uscg.mil and Mrs. Kelly Wyatt, SFLC CPD3/SBPL Contracting Officer, at Kelly.A.Wyatt@uscg.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>Battle Control System Branch (HBDB), Theater Battle Control Division (HBD), Battle Management Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Hanscom AFB, MA intends to modify sole source contract FA8722-10-C-0001 with Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) for the Technical Data Link Interface Device (TDLID) replacement and integration to include a nineteenth (19) month period of performance. The BCS-F program transitioned to sustainment on 29 Nov 2012, and the fielded systems are currently being sustained through an ICS arrangement through 31 Jan 2014. The Source of Repair Assessment (SORA) document dated 18 Jun 2009 requires long-term sustainment support by a combination of organic depot (software maintenance) and CLS (hardware sustainment, integration, and training). The TDLID replacement effort, which is the subject of this contract action, will be incorporated as a contract modification under the CLS contract. The TDLID hardware is currently obsolete and all available spares and parts of spares have been procured. The operating system of the TDLID will be unsupportable as of Apr 2014 and all of the sparing components are expected to run out by 2QFY18.<br /><br />The program office assesses that only TRS has the specialized capabilities and qualifications to deliver required repairs/corrections, modifications, and configuration updates to BCS-F software, hardware, design documentation, training curriculum, and technical data to maintain a critical 99.98% availability as mandated in the ORD Annex: 20 Feb 2003 pages 34-35. Award to any other source will result in a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />As the incumbent BCS-F development and ICS contractor, TRS is the only responsible contractor with the domain knowledge and technical insight into the integrated system design, configuration settings, and software interfaces necessary to satisfy the Government's requirements for continued support of the operational BCS-F capabilities for the TDLID replacement.<br /><br />For the TDLID replacement, internal software changes to the TDLID as well as Sentry<sup>TM</sup> software source code changes will be required, especially with regard to integration of data forwarding between Link 16 and Link 11 and Sentry<sup>TM</sup>timing constraints on high-capacity and high-speed links. TRS's intimate subsystem level knowledge regarding the BCS-F network designs will be required to successfully integrate the TDLID into BCS-F's dual-redundant LAN architecture. Additionally, TRS's knowledge and configuration maintenance of the BCS-F system's overall HW baseline, including rack designs and drawings, will streamline the incorporation of the new TDLID into the overall BCS-F system support documentation. <br /><br />This NOCA does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach; the Government will not reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. However, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), this does not preclude all responsible sources from submitting a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (AHPIS) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, IA anticipates a sole source service contract for a base and four option years under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (see attached justification) for the following requirement:
<p>Maintenance and Repair of Qiagen BioSprint 96 Magnetic Particle Processors.</p>
<p>This contract will be for a base period of one year with four option years for routine maintenance and applicable repairs for approximately 22 BioSprint 96 Magnetic Particle Processors at approximately $10,000 per year ($50,000 total).<br />The BioSprint 96 units are propriety equipment manufactured by Qiagen, Inc. of California. The USDA APHIS uses these BioSprint 96 units to perform testing for high consequence foreign animal diseases at a number of National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratories located across the nation. Qiagen is the only company that manufactures these BioSprint machines. The BioSprint96 magnetic particle processor is approved and validated for use with those SOPs. It is imperative that this equipment is serviced and maintained to meet the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) specifications. Qiagen, Inc. is therefore the most capable vendor for furnishing all necessary trained and experienced personnel, labor, diagnostic equipment, proprietary tools, parts and software, engineering upgrades (for safety or performance) and customer support services. Qiagen Field Service is the only organization certified by Qiagen (OEM) to repair, calibrate, maintain and move BioSprint96 robots. Qiagen manufactures, calibrates, certifies and stocks all parts necessary for repair, calibration and maintenance of BioSprint96 robots. These are proprietary parts, and as such, are not available from any other source or vendor. All of these components are necessary to provide the required technical support and expertise for on-site full service maintenance, including preventive maintenance. If the equipment is not maintained to OEM specifications, it could invalidate the instrument, which would be a critical deviation from the testing procedures. <br />Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent services listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office. Small business concerns are encouraged to participate. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this service along with your Statement of Capability. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary. Please email Statements of Capability to Larry Nelson at Larry.D.Nelson@aphis.usda.gov. Verbal inquiries will not be honored. Closing date for submission of Statement's of Capability is COB March 6, 2014. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 811219 with a small business size standard of $19.0 million.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation W911SR-14-R-0005for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The proposed contract will advance the fundamental understanding and shed light on the effectiveness of terahertz (THz) based spectroscopy as a tool for chemical and biological agent detection. The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to award a sole source contract to Vibratess, LLC located at 104 Chaucer Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901. The contractor shall conduct theoretical modeling and analysis with the goals of predicting signatures and indicators that may be accessed and to identify gaps in the THz spectroscopy data for Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). The THz spectroscopic region covers the frequencies from 0.3 THz to 10 THz in the electromagnetic spectrum. The research work and technical approach is based on leveraging THz spectrometer instrumentation that was developed by Vibratess, LLC.   This instrument is capable of scanning spectral range between 315 and 480 GHz with a spectral resolution of 0.1GHz. The spectral range has been shown to have distinguishable THz signatures for biological detection.  The Vibratess spectrometer permits observation of intense and narrow spectral resonances in transmission/absorption spectra of nano-samples from biological molecules and bacteria with widths between 0.05 and 0.2 cm-1 due to a high sensitivity, good spectral resolution, and a spatial resolution below the diffraction limit.   <br>  <br> Only Vibratess can successfully complete this work because only Vibratess has the required proprietary THz spectrometer with the capability to perform at the aforementioned ranges. It would be impractical at best and likely impossible to have another contractor independently develop the required assets and techniques to meet the Government's schedule. Vibratess is the only source able to do this work without any undue delays, costs, and risk. The delivery date will be 12-16 weeks after receipt of order. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712 and size standard of 500 employees. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is implemented by FAR 6. <br>  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Vibrates LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer.     <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF ITEMS/STATEMENT OF WORK <br> Task 1- THz Spectral Signature Modeling of Biological Materials.  The contractor shall conduct theoretical modeling and analysis with the goals of predicting signatures and indicators that may be accessed and to identify gaps in the THz spectroscopy data. The modeling shall also offer a confirmation on the integrity of the spectral data.  Biological simulants to be modeled shall include, but are not be limited to, Bacillus Globigii, BG, herring DNA, ovalbumin, the viral stimulant MS2 and Erwinia Herbicola (EH).  The contractor shall also verify the THz spectral range of interest. <br>  <br> Task 2- THz Spectral Signature measurements on Biological Surrogates.  Using the THz spectrometer that was developed by Vibratess LLC., the contractor shall perform spectroscopic measurements on all the biological simulants that were modeled in task 1.   <br>  <br> 2. Inspection/Acceptance: Inspection and Acceptance will be at Origin. <br> 3.  Delivery Schedule. Delivery shall be 365 days after contract award.   <br> 4.  Safety Considerations.  The contractor shall not use any sensitive items, hazardous items, chemical agents, carcinogens, or perform any microbiological and/or biomedical work in the performance of this contract. <br> PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES <br> 52.247-34 FOB Destination <br> 52.247-35 FOB Destination, within consignee's premises <br> 52.247-48 FOB Destination-Evidence of Shipment <br> 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration <br> 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items <br> 252.204-7003 Control of Government Personnel Work Product <br> 252.204-7004 Alternate A, Central Contractor Registration <br> 252.225-7002 Qualifying Country Sources as Subcontractors252.246-7000 Material Inspection and Receiving Report <br> 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation <br> 252.243-7001 Pricing of Contract Modifications <br> 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (the following clauses within this clause apply: 52.203-6, 52.204-10, 52.219-8, 52.219-27, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222 37, 52.222-40, 52.222-50, 52.223-18, 52.225-13, 52.232 33, 52.233-3, 52.233 4,) <br> 252.212-7001  Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (the following clauses within this clause apply: 52.203-3, 252.203-7000, 252.225-7001, 252.225-7008, 252.225-7012, 252.232 7003, 252.243-7002, 252.247-7023, 252.247-7024) <br> 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items <br> The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating for this effort is DO-C9. <br> This is sole source procurement.  <br>   Interested parties with questions or comments regarding this notice or the planned procurement should be emailed to gregory.faulcon.civ@mail.mil by close of business on 24 February 2014.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Souce Contract: Behavorial Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) Phase 3
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-14-24
<RESPDATE>040714
<ARCHDATE>04082014
<CONTACT>Mark Jones, Contracting Officer, Email mark.jones@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office (CMO) on behalf of the Information Innovation Office (I2O), intends to award a Sole Source contract to Lockheed Martin for Phase 3 of the Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program.  The primary goal of the BLADE program is to develop the capability to counter adaptive wireless communication threats in tactical environments and in tactically relevant time scales.    The research under this program, originally solicitated under DARPA-BAA-10-79, focuses on the development of an electronic attack (EA) system capable of automatically jamming new wireless communication threats in-the-field.  Meeting this objective requires the detection and characterization of a new threat, learning to effectively and efficiently jam the new threat, and to accurately assessing jam effectiveness in the field.  During Phase 1 (Prototype Algorithm Development &amp; Non-Real Time Performance Validation), the BLADE program demonstrated the feasibility of machine learning algorithms to separate and characterize communications networks, optimize jam waveforms, and provide real-time battle damage assessments.  During Phase 2 (Algorithm Improvement &amp; Real Time Test Bed Integration), BLADE for the first time achieved closed-loop machine learning and prosecution of jam waveforms against known and unknown radio frequency (RF) communication systems.<br /><br />As a current performer under both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the BLADE program, the LM team has developed the BLADE software for a digital radio transceiver, which in its current configuration provides sufficient front-end real-time analog processing and back-end digital processing to prosecute a limited number of signals over a limited number of bands.  Due to the closed loop nature of the system, real-time processing performance, subsystem synchronization and overall system latency are key performance parameters of the operation hardware upon which the BLADE architected software resides.  Likewise in addition to hosting the architecture, there are dedicated field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware processors necessary to maintain real-time throughput.<br /><br />In Phase 3, the objective is to further expand the operational envelope of the BLADE system by integrating the algorithms into a tactical communications jamming platform, addressing real-world problems like multipath, complex EME environments, moving platforms and targets, and field testing the system against representative threat environments at a Government test range.  Through this award, Lockheed Martin ATL will work with the hardware provider of the desired EW platform, Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, to integrate the BLADE system into that hardware and perform both ground and flight tests on the developmental unit.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate this follow-on effort with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  As a BLADE performer since the conception of the program, Lockheed Martin possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and intellectual property required to carry out the required research effort at significantly reduced cost and time to the Government.  Further, Lockheed Martin's successful demonstration of a Government validated TRL-4 BLADE system capable of simultaneously prosecuting multiple threats in multiple bands makes them uniquely qualified to develop a TRL-6 prototype system in Phase 3.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation for this specific requirement is currently available.  However, parties may indicate their interest and identify their capability to meet the requirement by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than April 7, 2014.  Submit this information to:  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Mark Jones, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington VA 22203, or via email to Mark.Jones@darpa.mil.  Questions shall be submitted to the above email address.  Responses received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />It is noted that DARPA's I2O Office maintains an annual Office-Wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking revolutionary research in a range of technical areas such as: secure cloud computing systems, software code with mathematically provable security properties, automated cyber security systems, electronic warfare, assured information access, and semantic analysis.  The "electronic warfare" mission thrust area under this BAA specifically seeks proposals for the development and integration of advanced electronic warfare algorithms.  Parties wishing to respond to this notice are invited, as an alternative, to submit a white paper against DARPA-BAA-13-32.

<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR Record <br> SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification - Purchase Request for CERFP Training Exercise <br> 1. Request the purchase of services from Davis Defense Group (DDG) for CERFP Training Exercise Package. <br>  <br> 2. DDG has provided previous courses to CERFP that are proprietary and copyrighted by DDG.  The training exercise currently requested is a follow on course of the previous course. DDG is the only agency that can provide the needed Level II training without having to send our CERFP unit back thru another company's Level I training and Level II training. The cost to the government would be substantial if we used any company other than DDG. <br>  <br> 3. Justification: FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), where it states that: <br> (iii) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-- <br> (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br>  <br> 4. It is this office's position that awarding this contract to a vendor other than DPP would result in a duplication of costs far exceeding what would be gained through competition. <br>  <br> 6. POC for this request is MAJ Bourgeois at david.bourgeois@us.army.mil or 318-290-5933. <br>  <br>

<DESC>J&A Statutory Authority:  <br> FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) - Only One Responsible Source <br>  <br> Planned Contract Award Date:  <br> 30 April 2014  <br>  <br> Planned Contract Award Number:  <br> W91215-14-D-0001 <br>  <br> Synopsis:  <br> The Aviation Integration Directorate (AID) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, cost plus fixed fee (IDIQ/CPFF) type contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source, to QintetiQ North America (QNA) CAGE Code 57SH7, Huntsville, AL with Craft Designs Inc., CAGE Code 3HD54, Huntsville, AL as a directed subcontractor,  as a follow-on effort for software development and maintenance for mission planning tools and software.  <br>  <br> Mission Planning Applications (MPA) is a set of software applications, consisting of:  aircraft Flight Performance Models (FPMs), Performance Planning Cards (PPC), Take Off and Landing Data (TOLD), Point Performance Planner (PX3), and other related mission planning software tools.  MPA will continue to develop new, and maintain existing applications (i.e. FPMs, PPC, PX3/TOLD, etc) for SOF mission planners to synchronize and track time-sensitive military operations.  These applications help to automate time-intensive planning activities, and provide detailed calculations for aircraft performance.  Digital representations of aircraft performance are integrated into a user-defined GUI, to improve planning accuracy and precision, reduce human errors, and ensure mission success.  MPA will develop, modernize, and sustain aircraft performance models, and associated mission planning tools under the proposed contract.  The identified source developed MPA from the Advanced Mission Planning Tools (AMPT) under previous contract efforts.  Under AMPT, the Government has unlimited rights for delivered software and source code.  The Government does not currently have source code for the proprietary tools used to develop the software.  Under the proposed MPA contract, the Government will obtain unlimited rights for all software.  This includes executable software, technical software documentation, all of the tools used to develop the software, as well as source code. <br>  <br> The previous Mission Planning Applications contract W91215-09-D-0001, was awarded to Westar Aerospace Defense Group, (corporate predecessor to Qintetiq-NA, the source listed above) on a sole source basis. <br>  <br> The Mission Planning Applications contract that preceded the contract awarded in 2009, DAAH10-03-D-0002 was awarded to Westar under competitive conditions.  Due to the transition, the Government and Westar had to engage in a series of approximately six (6) meetings to manage transition of the software development, procurement, and maintenance that entailed a level of effort of approximately twelve (12) personnel from the Government and an equal number from Westar over the course of a one (1) year period.  These discussions were supplemented with numerous telephone calls and emails.  The discussions also addressed the level of calculation accuracy/quality required, computation methods, data requirements to support Government Test, and the sufficiency of product documentation and format.  The Government estimates that this one year learning curve cost the Government approximately $300,000 in labor and travel costs.  <br>  <br> The Contracting Office posted a Request for Information (RFI) to www.fbo.gov on 8 Aug 2013 in order to determine the possibility of competing the follow-on Mission Planning Applications software development effort.  The RFI received eleven responses.  Six responses were deemed high technical risk, due to their inexperience of the subject matter, and lack of expertise.  Three responses were deemed medium technical risk, due to partial, limited experience of the subject matter, and some experience.  Two responses were deemed low technical risk, due to past experience with the subject matter, and significant experience.  The incumbent contractor and incumbent sub-contractor were the two responses with the lowest technical risk. <br>  <br> Based upon the Government's experience with the results of the RFI and the learning curve, the selection of another vendor would likely duplicate cost that is not likely to be recouped through competition and generate an unacceptable risk of meeting schedules for delivery of software improvements and updates to Special Operations Forces that are still engaged in overseas contingency operations and other National Command Authority directed missions.  Additionally, the use of an alternate development code base could cause incompatibility issues with other key systems (i.e. mission planning system, aircraft simulator systems, and the actual aircraft platforms). Currently, on SOF Rotary Wing Platforms, the flight performance modules used in the aircraft are the same as the desktop performance planning products. This process was established after a period of substantial effort on the part of the Government, in coordination with the vendor, to satisfy the required level of accuracy.  SOF Rotary Wing customers require an agreement of performance data calculations between the mission planning software and the aircraft operational flight program.  <br>  <br> In addition to the aforementioned costs, QinetiQ has developed several proprietary software tools at its expense to facilitate both software development and maintenance.  These proprietary tools assist in data validation, and are used to validate software deliverables prior to delivery.  The Government does not currently own these tools, and additional funds, on the order of $500,000 would be required for another source to develop replacements for these tools, along with potential schedule delays.  QinetiQ has previously stated it will not provide these tools to the Government or another third party developer and maintainer.  Additionally, the Government may be required to pay annual licensing fees.  The test tools are listed below: <br>  <br> (1)	Analysis/Inspection - Confirms the functional decomposition of the vFPM <br> (2)	Figure Mode Overlays - Compares the FPM generated data with the source data chart to ensure the calculated data represents reality <br> (3)	FPM Regression Iteration Test (FRIT) - Ensure the FPM returns values in quantitative agreement with known numeric values <br> (4)	Mode Interface Element (MIE) - Compares the FPM to ensure required modes exist (including inputs and outputs) and return the required values <br> (5)	Input Out of Bounds (IOOB) - Equates source data to the FPM produced data to ensure there are no inputs that are out of bounds (below minimum or above maximum) <br> (6)	Envelope Test (ET) - Verifies mode envelope boundaries by using internal data checking, input checking, and error/warning mechanisms of the FPM to report those boundaries <br> (7)	Message - Ensure FPM modes return the correct messages/flags to the user <br>  <br> If this requirement were to be competed, the Government estimates that at least an additional $800,000 would be required due to another source's learning curve and development of software tools to support development and maintenance efforts, and will not likely be recouped through competition.  Currently, the Government does not have a full understanding of all of the software code and technical data required to support a full and open competitive acquisition.  The Government estimates that a minimum of 10-12 months would be required to accumulate the necessary technical data/documentation and use of another source would introduce program risk. <br> 	 <br> In summary, the Government considered a competitive procurement, but based on the market research results, cost and schedule, this would not be in the Government's best interest.  QinetiQ NA's significant software development, testing and integration experience of the specific flight performance models makes them the only source capable of supporting these efforts.  The inevitability of competition injecting an estimated 16 - 22 month delay in acquiring software support services to develop enhancements and new modules, and to perform software maintenance on this legacy software product would place this program at a HIGH RISK without the probability of recouping the additional costs generated by using another source.  Based on market research, it has been determined that an alternate vendor would not have the expertise to comprehend the software without a significant learning curve and access to QinetiQ's proprietary software tools. <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The above information is the Government's rationale for intending to negotiate with only one source, QNA. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.  The capability statement must include a discussion on their capability to develop Mission Planning Applications, and how it surpasses the capability of QNA.  All capability statements should be submitted to the contracting office address.  No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail to the attention of Steven Nerenberg using the contract information provided in this synopsis. <br>  <br> Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this notice. NAICS is 541511 - Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. <br> All questions regarding this solicitation should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Steven Nerenberg. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> Aviation Integration Directorate, ACC-Redstone, ATTN:  CCAM-RDI, 401 Lee Blvd, Ft Eustis, VA  23604 <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> Steven Nerenberg  757-878-0104 / steven.l.nerenberg.civ@mail.mil

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

Also, describe any innovative methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels. The Subcontracting Safety Narrative is limited to two pages.<br /><br />(b) Basis of Evaluation: The Government is seeking to determine that the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the Offeror plans to properly manage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The Government's safety evaluation will collectively consider the following three elements for each offeror: (1) Experience Modification Rate; (2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate; and (3) Subcontracting Safety Narrative.</p>
<p>(A) Experience Modification Rate (EMR) <br />The Government will evaluate the EMR to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rating. Lower EMRs will be evaluated more favorably. <br /><br />For consistency, as a general guideline, the Government will use the table below to assist in evaluating the EMRs of the offerors.<br /><br />Risk EMR<br />Very Low Risk Less than 0.6<br />Low Risk From 0.6 to less than 0.8<br />Moderate Risk From 0.8 to 1.0<br />High Risk Greater than1.0 to 1.1<br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 1.1</p>
<p>(B) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate<br />The Government will evaluate the OSHA DART Rate to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rates. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be evaluated more favorably. <br />For consistency, as a general guideline, the Government will use the table below to assist in evaluating the DART rates of the offerors.<br />&nbsp;<br />Risk DART Rate <br />Very Low Risk Less Than 1.0 <br />Low Risk From 1.0 to 1.99 <br />Moderate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99 <br />High Risk From 3.0 to 4.0 <br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 4.0<br /><br />(C) Subcontracting Safety Narrative<br />The Government will evaluate the subcontracting safety narrative to determine the degree to which subcontractor safety performance will be considered in the selection of all levels of subcontractors on the upcoming project. The Government will also evaluate the effectiveness of the methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels.<br /><br />(4) PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance on projects of similar size and scope and location, CONUS and OCONUS. Demonstrated long-term government or private business relationships, repeat business on related efforts and construction support are valued. Provide a listing of all excellent performance ratings and letters of commendation from both private and Department of Defense (DOD) clients (designate your role: prime, consultant, or joint venture partner). Ratings must be within the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>(5) QUALITY CONTROL: A narrative of the firm's quality control methods outlining specific personnel (including their discipline/specialty) and procedures for above- water field inspections and diving operations, technical report preparation, structural assessments, analysis and design services is required for review. Of special interest are the QC processes in place that minimize the Governments effort to QA the firm's work product for errors, omissions, and quality.</p>
<p>(6) CAPACITY: Capacity to accomplish the work, including multiple task orders, in the required time. Submission Requirement: a) For each design team firm, list all current projects being designed in the design team firm's office with a current design fee of greater than $500,000.

The building, known as the Sewage Treatment Plant, is a steel frame wood sided structure with approximately 672 sq. ft. of space and was utilized to treat effluent from the project's recreation areas. The system is composed of a conventional biological process utilizing primary clarification, two state trickling g filters, followed by secondary clarification. After conventional biological treatment, the waste water passes through a pressure sand filter, three activated carbon columns in series, is chlorinated, and discharged into a holding tank for spray irrigation.  A small lab, 204 sq. ft.  is also within the building. The plant has not been utilized for the past 10 years. In 2013 all materials within the clarifiers and filters were removed.  The building was prefabricated and moved to the site by truck.  All filters chambers/clarifiers, floors, lab furnishings, base and support beams within the building are all metal.  Prospective bidders could purchase the plant for the value of scrap metal contained within the building.  A rough schematic of the building is attached hereto as (Exhibit B).  <br>  <br> 2.

In connection with any appeal proceeding under this condition, the bidder shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of appeal.  Pending final decision of a dispute hereunder, the bidder shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with the District Engineer's decision.

REJECTION OF BIDS:  The right is reserved, as the interests of the Government may require, to reject at any time and all bids, to waive any informality in bids received, and to accept or reject any items of any bid unless such bid is qualified by specific limitation. <br>  <br> 14.

The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard's aviation training program. Specifically, the equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting operations.</p>
<p>2. Background: One of the Coast Guard's primary missions is Search and Rescue. In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment and rescue swimmers to/from underway vessels and to/from the water. These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.</p>
<p>3. Vessel Description: The vessel shall be no shorter than 35 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 10 foot beam. The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet. Vessel gross weight shall be a minimum of 8 tons.</p>
<p>a. Other Characteristics: The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water. The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or "dead in the water". The vessel must have the endurance to maintain 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired. The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of +/- 10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds. An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash. The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g., antennas).</p>
<p>b. Required Deck Area: The minimum deck area is 60 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow crew members to safely conduct operations. The deck area must be free of all obstructions.</p>
<p>c. Vessel Equipment: The vessel shall have. At a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20nm), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Traverse City Operations Center, GPS and a long distance high beam search light.</p>
<p>d. Safety Equipment: The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers. Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in cold temperatures. The contractor shall provide helmets, gloves, goggles, hearing/ear protection, for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations. Anticipate that static electricity charge from the helicopter will be encountered. The vessel shall demonstrate the means to dissipate electrical charge through a grounding wand to the water or to the vessel.</p>
<p>e. Required Docking/Mooring Facilities: The contractor will be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel on East or West Bay, as well as berthing accommodations for the crew. The vessel shall be located within a 30 minute transit time from the geographical areas of operation.</p>
<p>f. Vessel Maintenance: The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer's technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations and any applicable federal, state, and/or local regulations.</p>
<p>4. Personnel: All contractor personnel are required to be U.S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.</p>
<p>a. Point of Contact: The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time. The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.</p>
<p>b. Crew: Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands. Each of the crew members shall be capable of operation and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and any required rescue operations. The training vessel shall also be able to accommodate two Coast Guard members in addition to required crew.</p>
<p>c. Coxswain: The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, shall be qualified in CPR and speak English Fluently.</p>
<p>d. Deckhands: The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations and deck seamanship.</p>
<p>e. Qualifications: Contractor shall attain a minimum set of standard qualifications for each Coxswain and Deckhand approved by the Coast Guard prior to execution of the contract. Contractor shall maintain a list of qualified personnel. Unqualified personnel cannot perform unsupervised during hoisting operations.</p>
<p>5. Operational Requirements / Site: The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:</p>
<p>a. Normal Schedule: Contractor will provide services from 1 April 2014 through 31 December 2014. The contractor will be paid by the session. A session is defined as 2.5 hours of on scene time and will not include transit time to or from the dock. The session will start when the contract boat is on scene at the agreed place of training. On scene time commences either: (1) when the contract boat arrives at the specified training site and no sooner than the scheduled time, or, (2) when the Coast Guard arrives on scene and requests for training to commence, whichever happens first. The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services and the specific on scene location within the area of operation a minimum of 24 hours in advance.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

b.  Provide the technology required to efficiently characterize and accurately model/simulate the variability in material behavior and properties in support of design and field usage assessment of aerospace propulsion and structural components; and

c.  Accelerate the development and insertion of new materials that have been optimized for critical location-specific properties required for advanced components.

Lab Tour:  A lab tour is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, 04 March 2014, beginning at 10:00 AM WPAFB Local Time.  The tour will be restricted to labs in building 655.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command  <br>  Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel  <br>  4400 Martin Road  <br>  Rm: A6SE040.001  <br>  Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000  <br>  Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to:  <br>  Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command  <br>  Office of Command Counsel  <br>  4400 Martin Road  <br>  Rm: A6SE040.001  <br>  Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000  <br>  Fax: (256) 450-8840  <br>    <br>  The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.  <br>  If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMCAMC-Level Protest Procedures.  <br>    <br>  Proposals are due no later than Wednesday, 26 February 2014 by 4:00PM CST and may only be submitted electronically via email to the following points of contact: Ms. Jacqueline Montague, Contract Specialist, at jacqueline.t.montague.civ@mail.mil AND Ms. Dawn Windham, Contracting Officer, at dawn.m.windham.civ@mail.mil.  <br>    <br>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_x] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [x_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_x] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [x_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[x_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.

<DESC>Four geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) piers, each built with different<br />reinforcement strengths and aggregate backfill material, were constructed at the<br />FHWA's Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in collaboration with the Long-<br />Term Bridge Performance Program. The objective of the research is to assess the<br />secondary deformation characteristics of GRS for load bearing applications under<br />service load conditions. The experiment consisted of axially loading the piers with<br />490 kN decommissioned prestressed concrete girders, resulting in an equivalent<br />vertical applied stress of 200 kPa. The geometry of each GRS composite was 1.2 m<br />square by 2.3 m in height, for an approximate base to height ratio of 0.5. The facing<br />element for each GRS pier is a simple, split-faced concrete masonry unit (CMU) that<br />is frictionally connected to the GRS composite at a nominal vertical reinforcement<br />spacing of 0.2 m. The piers were instrumented to record reinforcement strain, earth<br />pressures, and deformations. This paper will discuss the objectives of the experiment,<br />explain the testing program, and share some of the vertical deformation results after<br />almost four months in-service. In addition, the results will be compared to the results<br />of a long-term (since 1999) study on secondary settlement of a GRS abutment.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this administrative amendment is to update the links for the "Breakdown of Proposed Estimated Cost (Plus Fee) and Labor Hours" workbook found in Section IV.C. on page 37 of the BAA.</p>
<p>The workbook can be found in a link here:<br /><a href="http://oamp.od.nih.gov/DGS/reference-material-prospective-offerors-and-contractors/contracting-forms">http://oamp.od.nih.gov/DGS/reference-material-prospective-offerors-and-contractors/contracting-forms</a></p>

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to support the development of a new model for computational analysis of biological data that has the potential to address the challenges described above. This model (which has been articulated recently in a series of NCI Precision Medicine Workshops and publications by experts in the field of biomedical informatics) involves the creation of a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides security and data access for developers of analytic tools. In this model, applications are brought to the data, rather than bringing the data to the applications. Such a "Cancer Genomics Cloud" has the potential to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic data and provide a more cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community.
<p>Towards this end, the NCI seeks to sponsor the development of multiple Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots that will be available for use and testing by the scientific community as part of a competitive evaluation that will include technical benchmarking and cost analysis. If successful, the NCI will consult with the cancer research community and relevant oversight committee(s) to define, and potentially construct, a production version of one or more of the pilot clouds, or a successor design informed by the results of the pilot evaluations. In spirit, and by design, this new initiative will be the first step toward the establishment of a full Cancer Knowledge Commons, along the lines called for in the National Academy report on Precision Medicine, and will be coordinated with The National Institutes of Health's Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative and other relevant activities in large-scale data analysis.</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:ncicloud@mail.nih.gov">ncicloud@mail.nih.gov</a>. Any inquiries submitted after February 20, 2014 at 4:00 PM local time may not be reviewed. FAQ are anticipated to be posted on a weekly basis at: <a href="http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots">http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots</a>.</p>

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, Phone 703-875-4357, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC>Please note the questions and answers to this RFP as follows:<br /><br />(1) What is the on-site time required in AMAPA ?<br /><br />Estimated on-site presence for the duration of the project is about 75 days, although various tasks will likely require 2 or more team members to be engaged on-site at the same time.<br />&nbsp;<br />(2) Should the data center deliverable include formation - the basis for the design/build for the strategy work, or<br /><br />(3) Are you expecting initial drawing sets that would require stamp engineering drawing spec and local engineering certification(s) ?<br /><br />If by "formation" this means "training," the contractor would build the capacity and capabilities of the grantee through collaborative work defining the requirements of the data center, and would then outline a plan for future capacity building recommended that the grantee pursue on their own after the project ends. Good practice would be to provide at least 'in-brief" and "out-brief" presentations and discussion sessions to technical personnel at the grantee facilities during site visits, which is also a way to help build local capacity.<br /><br />The drawing sets would require, at a minimum, the stamp of the engineer hired by the U.S. firm to develop them. During preparation of the legal and regulatory survey and the implementation finance plan, the contractor and grantee will determine if engineers licensed in Amapa' must certify for the study documents to be considered for financing by the Amapa' State Government, Brazilian Federal Government, multilateral lenders or any other potential funders. <br /><br />(4) Has some of the work already been done and is there a document?<br /><br />No design work has been done to date.<br /><br />(5) What are the constraints that have influenced the stated 13-week work plan? Is this a hard performance requirement?<br /><br />The 13-week workplan emerged from dialog with the grantee based on their understanding of the development planning at the State level; it can be adjusted through dialog with and approval from the grantee regarding project milestones and performance.<br /><br />(6) What was the basis of the budgetary data center components and IT equipment estimates listed under U.S. Export Potential (p. 15-19)? <br />e.g. Is there a high-level list/inventory of existing and potential Amapa State applications/services to be deployed to the envisioned data center?<br /><br />An application inventory of multiple State agencies is a task required in the Terms of Reference, in order to arrive at an accurate estimate of the requirements for the data center that will best meet the Grantee's needs and resources, and the ability of the grantee to mobilize resources will be affected in part by the quality of the work conducted under the Feasibility Study. <br /><br />(7) The deliverables described in Sub-task 3.9.2 indicate a complete executable BCDR Plan. We would expect that the detail BCDR Plan elements described to be part of a data center deployment phase? Can you clarify the intent and timing of this deliverable.<br /><br />The business continuity/disaster recovery plan will be high-level, identifying key precepts and critical aspects/details that are recommended by the contractor and that bidders for the deployment phase should address, in the contractor's view. This will be based on the design work carried out collaboratively with the grantee, and the acceptable form and substance of this deliverable should be discussed with the grantee at project kickoff.<br />

<DESC>Synopsis: Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir Division, on behalf of the Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) intends to negotiate with Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) of 75 Coromar Drive in Goleta, CA, on a sole source basis to provide III-V Infrared Focal Plane Array (FPA) Fabrication Development.  Specifically, the Contractor shall refine and demonstrate high-performance infrared FPA technologies that are capable of mid-wave infrared (MWIR), long-wave infrared (LWIR) and LWIR/Dual-Band detection.   This effort is a follow-on action to BAA Contract W909MY-11-C-0022, which was competitively awarded in support of the Vital Infrared Sensor Technology Acceleration (VISTA) Program.  The proposed contract action will leverage the research and development previously performed in order to further refine and develop advanced infrared technologies.    <br>    <br>  The estimated period of performance is twenty-four (24) months; this includes a twenty-one (21) month base period and a three (3) month option period.  The resultant contract will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).  It has been determined that Raytheon Vision Systems is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source.    <br>    <br>  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  All proposals received within 45 days will be considered by the Government.  Responses shall be no longer than ten (10) pages and shall be in a Microsoft Word compatible format.  All responses and requests for further information shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Elizabeth Bray at elizabeth.a.bray10.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>    <br>

This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. A previous RFI was posted under the solicitation number W911S8-13-R-0007.   Any responses submitted under the previous RFI will not be considered as part of Fort Carson's market research.  If you are a new or previously interested party regarding the BOS Services at Fort Carson, please submit a response to this RFI.   <br>  <br> The Fort Carson Contracting Office is seeking comments on the below questions: <br> 1)	Briefly describe the Contractor's primary business line(s): <br> 2)	Provide the Contractor's DUNS number and Cage Code. Provide the socioeconomic status of the Contractor with this response, if any (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran, economically-disadvantage-women, large business, etc). <br> 3)	Briefly describe the base operations and maintenance support services that the Contractor's company provides; to include providing resources to plan, organize, manage personnel, operate and perform the Fort Carson base operations and maintenance support services.  <br> 4)	Please demonstrate the Contractor's capability by providing recent and relevant past performance history.  Please provide no more than five of the most recent and relevant experience to include contract number, location, value, period of performance and scope of work and point of contact. <br> 5)	Based on the Contractor's performance of similar services, what type of contract will work best for this requirement (Firm-Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, etc.)?   Please identify and provide rationale for which elements of the contract may be performed with a firm-fixed-price or are best suited for cost reimbursement?    <br> 6)	Based on the functional areas of work, what would be the recommended benefit of using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable versus best value trade-off (when evaluating Contractor proposals)? Provide supporting information or recommend areas on the Contractor's professional opinion. <br> 7)	Based on your performance of similar services, provide examples of some factors that would provide most advantageous trade off factors for best value trade-offs.  <br> 8)	Based on the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), can the Contractor perform all work for this requirement? If not, what percentage of work will be sub contracted? <br> 9)	What past experience has your company had in managing contracts of this magnitude? What past experience of your firm makes you capable of handling a contract of this scope and magnitude? Were you a prime or subcontractor on contracts of similar magnitude? If you were a subcontractor, what part of the work were you responsible for? <br> 10)	What is your experience in being a prime contractor? Also, what is the maximum number of subcontractors you had on one contract with a scope of work similar to this one? <br> 11)	FAR clause 52.219-14 states that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. How have you complied with this regulation on past similar contracts? Do you anticipate being able to comply on this contract given the PWS? <br> 12)	Does your company have the cash flow or resources available to manage a large contract if the Government pays on a monthly basis? Based on the projected workload, how long will you be able to sustain payroll, should a delay in payment, outside of our office control, occur? <br> 13)	Does the Contractor have an accounting system determined acceptable by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for accumulating and reporting incurred costs under cost-reimbursement contracts in accordance with DFASRS clause 252.242-7006?   <br> 14)	As the prime contractor, do you or will you have a purchasing system that complies with the criteria in DFARS 252.244-7001(c)?  If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system. <br> 15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS? <br> 16)	Please provide feedback on the draft PWS to determine which areas may be unclear or where more specific information may be useful. Do you have any overall recommendations for improving the PWS? <br> 17)	Fort Carson is undergoing significant expansion of facilities and infrastructure as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) gaining installation which makes it difficult for the installation populations and contract requirements to be predictable.  Based upon past experience with BOS services, can the contractor assist the government in indentifying benefits of a cost reimbursement contract versus a firm-fixed-price contract? <br> 18)	Indentify any measurable ways for the contractor and Government to assure cost controls. <br> 19)	Provide a recommendation and explanation of what type of fee might incentivize the contractor to control costs and also be the best suited for this requirement given the fiscal uncertainties and likelihood of frequent incremental funding.

<DESC>See  quote mark additional documents quote mark  for RFI Amendment 003     <br>   THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain comments on preliminary requirement specifications, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. A previous RFI was posted under the solicitation number W911S8-13-R-0007.   Any responses submitted under the previous RFI will not be considered as part of Fort Carson's market research.  If you are a new or previously interested party regarding the BOS Services at Fort Carson, please submit a response to this RFI.    <br>    <br>  The Fort Carson Contracting Office is seeking comments on the below questions:  <br>  1)	Briefly describe the Contractor's primary business line(s):  <br>  2)	Provide the Contractor's DUNS number and Cage Code. Provide the socioeconomic status of the Contractor with this response, if any (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran, economically-disadvantage-women, large business, etc).  <br>  3)	Briefly describe the base operations and maintenance support services that the Contractor's company provides; to include providing resources to plan, organize, manage personnel, operate and perform the Fort Carson base operations and maintenance support services.   <br>  4)	Please demonstrate the Contractor's capability by providing recent and relevant past performance history.  Please provide no more than five of the most recent and relevant experience to include contract number, location, value, period of performance and scope of work and point of contact.  <br>  5)	Based on the Contractor's performance of similar services, what type of contract will work best for this requirement (Firm-Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, etc.)?   Please identify and provide rationale for which elements of the contract may be performed with a firm-fixed-price or are best suited for cost reimbursement?     <br>  6)	Based on the functional areas of work, what would be the recommended benefit of using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable versus best value trade-off (when evaluating Contractor proposals)? Provide supporting information or recommend areas on the Contractor's professional opinion.  <br>  7)	Based on your performance of similar services, provide examples of some factors that would provide most advantageous trade off factors for best value trade-offs.   <br>  8)	Based on the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), can the Contractor perform all work for this requirement? If not, what percentage of work will be sub contracted?  <br>  9)	What past experience has your company had in managing contracts of this magnitude? What past experience of your firm makes you capable of handling a contract of this scope and magnitude? Were you a prime or subcontractor on contracts of similar magnitude? If you were a subcontractor, what part of the work were you responsible for?  <br>  10)	What is your experience in being a prime contractor? Also, what is the maximum number of subcontractors you had on one contract with a scope of work similar to this one?  <br>  11)	FAR clause 52.219-14 states that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. How have you complied with this regulation on past similar contracts? Do you anticipate being able to comply on this contract given the PWS?  <br>  12)	Does your company have the cash flow or resources available to manage a large contract if the Government pays on a monthly basis? Based on the projected workload, how long will you be able to sustain payroll, should a delay in payment, outside of our office control, occur?  <br>  13)	Does the Contractor have an accounting system determined acceptable by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for accumulating and reporting incurred costs under cost-reimbursement contracts in accordance with DFASRS clause 252.242-7006?    <br>  14)	As the prime contractor, do you or will you have a purchasing system that complies with the criteria in DFARS 252.244-7001(c)?  If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system.  <br>  15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS?  <br>  16)	Please provide feedback on the draft PWS to determine which areas may be unclear or where more specific information may be useful. Do you have any overall recommendations for improving the PWS?  <br>  17)	Fort Carson is undergoing significant expansion of facilities and infrastructure as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) gaining installation which makes it difficult for the installation populations and contract requirements to be predictable.  Based upon past experience with BOS services, can the contractor assist the government in indentifying benefits of a cost reimbursement contract versus a firm-fixed-price contract?  <br>  18)	Indentify any measurable ways for the contractor and Government to assure cost controls.  <br>  19)	Provide a recommendation and explanation of what type of fee might incentivize the contractor to control costs and also be the best suited for this requirement given the fiscal uncertainties and likelihood of frequent incremental funding. (i.e. fixed fee, incentive fee).  <br>  20)	Will your company submit a proposal for this requirement? (Assuming your company is qualified under the set-aside chosen.)  <br>    <br>  A Draft PWS and Draft Technical Exhibits have been attached to assist with the above questions.   <br>    <br>  The Acquisition Strategy for this requirement has yet to be approved, and thus a set aside, if any, has not been finalized yet. Once a set-aside, if any, is known a notice will be posted on FBO.  <br>    <br>  The submittal in response to this RFI shall be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper.  The submittal shall be no more than 20 pages. The font for text shall be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Submitted responses should be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  <br>    <br>  Responses for the above questions are due no later than 24 February 2014, 17:00 MST.

<p>MSC requires professional engineering Contractor support to perform a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) study to determine a safe wastage allowance for the rails and associated supporting structure in accordance with commercial standards for the AS-39 5-Ton crane track on board the USS Frank Cable. The analysis shall be performed with the initial assumption that the rails and supporting structure are at 100%. Various wastage scenarios shall then be applied to the FEA model to iteratively show both deflections and stresses in the web, flange, and supporting structure of the rail system. Multiple iterations will be required to develop a robust database capable of predicting structural adequacy and deflections in various wastage conditions. The documentation of the existing structure is available but may not be sufficiently legible or detailed. It can be used to develop an initial FEA model, but a ship-check will be necessary to validate the structural details used in developing the FEA model. Also, during this ship-check, stress/strain testing will be required to validate the model. This requirement will be fulfilled through a firm-fixed-price task order. The period of performance will be approximately eight (8) months.</p>
<p>This procurement is a FAR Part 12 acquisition conducted using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />This is a request for information (RFI) and should not be construed as a solicitation announcement, invitation for bids, request for quotations, or a request for proposals. After reviewing the description of requirements, interested capable contractors are invited to respond to the following questions. (1) Can MATLAB/SIMULINK or other model based engineering tools be used in futuristic concept exploration activities and prove the effectiveness of end-to-end Model-Based Systems Engineering? (2) How can we combine model based engineering and traditional analysis tools to create innovative approaches to concept performance assessment? Please respond if you can fulfill the entire requirement. Responses should follow this format and be submitted electronically as one (1) complete document. This RFI is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to acquire any products or services.<br /><br />Additionally, your response will be treated only as information for the Government to consider. You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI. Furthermore, this request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort. The information you supply may be used by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/performance work statements and/or statement of objectives. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted, or competition sensitive information contained in their response.<br /><br />The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to identify potential small business sources with the technical capability and necessary resources to provide innovative model based simulation development and advanced concept performance assessments using the following NAICS Codes: 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) and 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services / Computer Program or Software Development, Custom..<br /><br />The MDA Advanced Technology Advanced Concepts and Performance Assessment Directorate (DVS) is soliciting vendor capabilities to work cooperatively with government engineers from programs across the Advanced Technology portfolio. DVS requires a diverse team of analysts and systems, algorithm, software, and simulation engineers to provide research and development (R&amp;D) for innovative model-based engineering and analysis approaches for the design, development, production, documentation, delivery, support, and sustainment of advanced technology concept models, simulations, visualizations, and tools. This team will use these innovative approaches, simulations, algorithms, and software tools to assess and analyze performance of technology components and concepts that may provide benefit to future Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architectures. The government simulation and assessment laboratory is the foundation for the Advanced Technology "smart buyer" approach to technology concept assessment working closely with industry and Government engineering teams. Performers are required to maintain a "Top Secret" (TS) clearance with up to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), as required. <br /><br />DVS specifically requests innovative uses of the Matlab/Simulink and Open Architecture Simulation Interface Specification (OASIS) Simitar tools set for model based engineering in the development of advanced concept simulations. DVS prefers model based engineering tools but does make use of innovative non-model based simulations and tools when they provide significant analytical ability to assess a particular technology concept and this ability does not exist in current model-based tools. DVS controls a government Modeling, Simulation, Software, and Analysis (MSSA) laboratory with locations on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, and Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which are the primary development sites for all products. The Government provides full time IT support for the Lab and it contains analysis and simulation workstations and a high performance-computing cluster. The cluster and workstations use RedHat Enterprise 6.4 and Windows 7 Enterprise operating systems. The lab is not required to be staffed 24 hours a day, but is certified for continuous operation and unattended processing. This synopsis encourages maximum use of off-the-shelf existing models minimizing non-recurring engineering (NRE) development costs. MDA prefers maximum use of non-developmental items (NDI), commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software available from either contractor or U.S. Government sources. <br /><br />DVS will only consider non-proprietary models, algorithms, simulations, and software. All simulations and software used on or developed for this contract will be non-proprietary with unlimited rights in Technical Data as defined in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 227.7103-5. Capability statements need to describe available non-proprietary models and any demonstrated experience through past and current performance in meeting all of the categories listed below. Also explain the company's effort in the past five years for the same/similar requirements. Include information such as contract number (indicate if your role was a prime or subcontractor), organization supported, contract value, Government points of contact (current telephone numbers and e-mail addresses), and a brief description of how the contract referenced relates to the requirements described herein. <br /><br />In addition, complete the capability matrix at the end of this notice, which identifies key performance requirements. For each of these requirements, put a check mark in one box: current capability, minor modifications, or major modifications. Then fill out the comment and reference sections. Reference the location of the details in your capability statement. <br /><br />MDA requests all interested parties submit a capability statement demonstrating their proficiency/experience with innovative model based engineering solutions using Matlab/Simulink or other model based engineering tools in&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the following categories:<br /><br />1. Innovative approaches to technology concept analysis using high fidelity, closed loop, physics-based models. Include previous experience conducting similar high fidelity analysis over the past five years.<br />2. System- and mission-specific analysis capabilities including development, staffing, approval, and maintenance of analysis plans and guidelines. Ability to analyze and aggregate very large data sets into coherent understandable white papers and briefings for senior leadership.<br />3. Ability to conduct quick turn analysis for configuring models, executing simulation runs, aggregating data, and developing briefings.<br />4. Ability to identify and specify modeling and simulation requirements that generate data required by various analysis plans and guidelines.<br />5. Innovative approaches to Matlab/Simulink simulation and software development. Include in your description COTS, GOTS, and non-developmental simulations immediately available.<br />6. Code generation from Matlab/Simulink for integration with external simulations or prototype hardware. <br />7. Booster, kill vehicle, and weapons system modeling and analysis.<br />8. Electro-Optical (EO) / Infrared (IR) sensor modeling and analysis. <br />9. Radio Frequency (RF) sensor modeling and assessment.<br />10. Threat modeling and analysis.<br />11. Use and integration with the OASIS and its government reference implementation known as Simitar. Include your past use of OASIS and methodology for transforming Simulink models into Simitar models.<br />12. Development of integrated end-to-end simulations of a diverse set of varying sensor and interceptor technologies. <br />13. Development of tactical representative algorithms for autopilots, guidance, navigation, control, tracking, classification, and discrimination.<br />14. Development of fast-running simulation testbeds capable of evaluating the performance of government and industry algorithms for autopilots, guidance, navigation, control, tracking, classification, and discrimination.</p>
<p>DVS encourages acquisition strategy ideas on items 1-4 below.</p>
<p>1. Innovative approaches to simulation and software development using Matlab/Simulink.<br />2. Innovative approaches to conducting analysis of booster, kill vehicle, and sensor performance across a wide variety of technology concepts.<br />3. Description of risks and potential mitigation plans to the above innovative approaches.<br />4. Other input the respondent considers of importance.</p>
<p>2. INSTRUCTIONS:<br /><br />Participants will submit their response no later than&nbsp;10 July 2013, 12:00 p.m. Central Time All responses must be electronic portable document format (pdf) only.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pacific Instruments, Inc., 4080 Pike Ln. Concord California 94520-1227 for the establishment of a 60 month Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to place delivery orders for the procurement of materials required to support the Survivability and Weapons Effects Division, Testing and Dynamic Measurements Branch (Code 663).<br />This procurement is for up to <br /><br />&bull; twenty five (25) sixteen (16) channel system enclosure (Model No. 5810);<br />&bull; one hundred fifty (150) three (3) channel digital ruggedized Ethernet data recorder enclosure, (Model No. 5871) with 110 VAC power supply (Model 5891);<br />&bull; one hundred (100) 2 MS/s, 14-bit, 2Mbyte memory transducer recorder channel module (Model No. 5842);<br />&bull; five hundred (500) 200 KS/s, 24-bit, 1Mbyte memory transducer recorder channel module (Model No. 5843), and <br />&bull; fifteen (15) Command Encoder, Optic, 12 VDC (Model No. 5883)with 110 VAC Power Supply (Model 5891). <br />&bull; Two additional CLINs shall be included for the repair services of the recorders and technology upgrades to the recorders.<br /><br />This is a follow on to Pacific Instruments, Inc. N00167-10-D-0003.<br /><br />The equipment to be purchased must be compatible with existing recorders currently being used by the Survivability and Weapons Effects Division, Testing and Dynamic Measurements Branch (Code 663). To facilitate data processing and the derivation of transfer functions, it is necessary for the electrical characteristics to be identical for all channels in a particular test. Also, to provide an automated error free measurement system the software programming commands and data structures must be identical for all channels of the system. The recorder setup software used to configure the recorders is proprietary to Pacific Instruments with restrictions on use or private modification. The source code of software is regarded as a trade secret by Pacific Instruments. NSWCCD has developed its entire data acquisition system around the equipment made by Pacific Instruments. The installation and mounting hardware is designed to interface with these recorders. Pacific Instruments was the only company found during an extensive one-year market search able to meet the government's specific technical requirements of 24-bit converters with 200,000 samples per second.<br /><br />The award is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 334515 and has a standard size of 500 employees. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, under the authority of FAR 6.302. <br /><br />Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions must be in writing to the contract specialist lucy.tascone@navy.mil.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for technology using a nanofermentation system to produce high value materials. <strong>The ORNL Technology Transfer Office has extended the deadline to&nbsp;accept licensing applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">License applications must now be submitted to the ORNL Technology Transfer Office by&nbsp;March 10, 2014</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The high cost and limited quantity of many nanomaterials create a barrier to their commercialization because potential end users are reluctant to develop applications for materials when they are not confident the materials will be available in useful quantities at cost competitive pricing. ORNL researchers have successfully expanded the application areas for nanoparticles produced using a novel fermentation method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This technology also has broader applications for the production of luminescent materials using fermentation-type processes (to produce non-toxic lighting technology) and the development of metal-oxide, mixed-metal-oxide, and non-oxide semiconductor particles. Another application is for semiconductors such as copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and copper zinc tin sulfur (CZTS) that are useful solar cell materials for highly flexible, lightweight solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In the earlier work, researchers produced large quantities of semiconducting quantum dots of high market value using a bacterial fermentation process that employs chemicals to control bacterial synthesis. The researchers developed a way to control particle size and morphology by a chemical means of modifying the fermentation broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Potential applications include production of various complex and thin films, solar cells, and other semiconductor applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses. If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.<br /><br />For additional information and license application, contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865-574-4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov.<br /><br />Technology descriptions and related publications may be found at&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;" href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/technology-innovation-program/nanofermentation-system">http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/technology-innovation-program/nanofermentation-system</a><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;">.</span></p>

This solicitation has been extended ** All bids are due Monday Feb 24th at 8:00am CST 
Questions to previous questions are below. 
Last day to submit additional questions will be Tuesday February 18th at 7:00pm CST 
Final questions will be answered Wednesday February 19th. 
Answers to questions received;
Proposals will be submitted to La'Quise Mack at La'Quise.Mack@va.gov
	Fill out the 1449 submitted on fbo.gov you may email the 1449 along with any supporting attachments. 
	It is your responsibility to ensure I receive your complete proposal. 
1.	Was the specifications written by a vendor and if so, will they be allowed to bid the contract and who is the vendor? 
"	The SOW was written by a panel of health professionals within the VHA.  Any vendor that contributed significantly to the development of the SOW will not be allowed to bid on the contract.  
2.	What is the budget for this effort?
"	The final budget is still being determined. 
3.	Is there a list of regulations for which this device must comply?
"	It is the vendor's responsibility to determine what regulatory standards must be met.  At a minimum, the device must comply with VA safety standards, which are based upon the most current NFPA 99 codes for healthcare facilities, and all applicable electrical safety and FCC codes. 
4.	Who will be responsible for costs related to FDA testing if necessary?
"	It is assumed that the product will meet FDA standards for a Class 1 device.  It is the vendor's responsibility to cover all costs related to obtaining all needed FDA approvals.
5.	Please clarify if "days" as used in the RFP are working days or calendar days.
"	Calendar Days 
6.	Would you consider a solution with a less complicated sensor that can accomplish the initial set of capabilities as well as future capabilities described in section B.2?
"	This query does not provide sufficient information to allow us to determine if the vendor's bid would meet our specifications.  Vendors are encouraged to supply detailed specifications of the product that they propose to supply in response to the offering.  The acceptability of each bid will be judged based on how well the vendor describes their product including its functionality and future capabilities. 
7.	We have a very unique product that monitors patient movements while in bed and in chairs.  I believe our system would be very similar to what is outlined in the solicitation and additionally includes several features that would further enhance patient safety.  It is already commercially available and has been purchased .with installation scheduled to begin next week. This would not be exactly as your Statement of Work, would this be acceptable.
"	Based on the limited information supplied in this query, it is not possible for us to determine the acceptability of the vendor's product.  The vendor is encouraged to supply detailed specifications of their product so that we can assess how well it would meet our specifications including product functionality and future capabilities.
8.	Would it be possible to interface with the folks who have put together the clinical/technical specifications and introduce our product for their review and consideration?
"	At this time, only bids are being accepted.

The amendment reflects corrections to the RFP Question and Answer deadline dates.  Attachment 'RFPAmendment01' provides the modification to the solicitation document. The proposal submission due date remains unchanged at this time.**     <br>      <br>   The current posting serves as the Pre-Solicitation Notice ('notice of proposed contract action quote mark  in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)) for the Threat Systems Operations Maintenance and Integrated Support (TSOMIS) effort.  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement to provide the acquisition, development, fielding, operations, maintenance, and sustainment of Threat systems for Army testing and training.       <br>        <br>    REQUIREMENT:    <br>        <br>    PEO STRI anticipates a requirement for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Integrated Support.  TSOMIS will encompass providing the test and evaluation and training community with services that are capable of operating, maintaining and sustaining ground and airborne Threat Systems.  The Threat Systems must be maintained, operated and sustained to provide realistic Threat capabilities for Operational and Developmental testing and training with the U.S. Army.  This support will include engineering, configuration management, technical inspections, testing, evaluations, validation and accreditation, transportation, site surveys, transportation upload and download support, logistics, developmental support, integration, storage, maintenance, operations, and training including items of support equipment such as system spare parts, special tools, test equipment and depot level documentation.  There are two locations anticipated as the place of performance for these services and support.  They are Government facilities at Redstone Arsenal (RSA), Alabama, 35898 and Government facilities at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico, 88002.    <br>        <br>        <br>    ACQUISITION APPROACH:    <br>        <br>    The Government anticipates a Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle to be awarded.  The Contract Line Item Number structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.  The predominance of the work will be CPFF and Time and Materials.  The period of performance is anticipated to be one base year and four one-year options for a potential period of performance of five-years.  The estimated dollar value is approximately $45M.        <br>        <br>    The anticipated Procurement Acquisition Lead Time (PALT) milestones are as follows:    <br>        <br>    Anticipated Event Approximate Dates:    <br>        <br>    Release of TSOMIS Draft Solicitation: 06 December 2013    <br>    Deadline for submission of Questions to Draft Solicitation: 17 December 2013    <br>    Release of TSOMIS Final Solicitation: 22 January 2014    <br>    Proposal Submission: 24 February 2014    <br>    Target Award Date: December 2014    <br>        <br>    Disclaimer: This notice is not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for costs associated with providing comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions.  This action is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure the subject products, services or information.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.      <br>        <br>    Primary Point of Contact: Terri Harvey, terri.l.harvey10.civ@mail.mil, 407-208-3338    <br>    Additional Point of Contact: Jean M.

<DESC>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 22, Network  Contracting Office 4811 Airport Plaza Drive, Suite 600, Long Beach, California, as  directed by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS). Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for purchase request:  691-14-2-7887-0001.  

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved: VAGLAHS needs the continuation of essential veteran patient care services that are provided by Dental Assistants and Dental Hygienists. The action will be awarded as a new, Purchase Order for the period of February 18, 2014 through September 30, 2014.This procurement action covers services provided by Aerotek Scientific, LLC and will be funded by the Veteran Affairs Central Office Homeless Dental Initiative Program. A solicitation for long term services is currently in the process of being finalized and will be award by October 1, 2014.

(  ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4	`
(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

3. Description of Requirement: GLAHS is requesting sole source procurement from Aerotek Scientific, LLC. The estimated price is $167,648.00.  The patient care services provided by these contracted dental assistants and dental hygienists are required and essential to avoid adverse impact to veteran care.  These dental auxiliaries improve the safe and efficient delivery of dental care and patient access especially for the eligible veterans as part of the Homeless Veterans Dental Initiative Program (HVDIP). The HVDIP enhances dental services for five groups of Veterans that  are named in the VHA Directive 2007-039, Eligibility Guidelines for a One-Time course of Dental Care for Certain Homeless and Other Enrolled Veterans. President Obama and Secretary Eric K. Shinseki are committed to ending homelessness among Veterans over the next five years


4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service being procured is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253 (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-2(b). This agreement is to be a non-competitive agreement, as authorized under FAR Part 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. 
?
5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:  Currently, VAGLAHS is experiencing shortages. The "unusual and compelling urgency" is due to the fact that the Contractor is currently providing qualified dental auxiliaries (six dental assistants for 3 VAGLAHS dental sites) which are required for safe, patient-centered care and it is imperative that this continuity and integrity of quality patient care be maintained without disruption. In addition, these six dental assistants improve the dentist to dental assistant staffing ratio and address recommendations of "inadequate dental support staff'.  Therefore, any time lapse in the employment of this contractual dental support staff would be extremely detrimental to the VA mission of providing exceptional patient-centered healthcare to veterans. Another contractor will not be able to step in immediately to provide these services due to the lengthy credentialing process and to ensure continuity of care. 

These services are very essential to the patient care resulting in life or death situations.  Therefore, a decision was made to establish a short term Purchase Order with Aerotek Scientific, LLC because of the existing unusual and compelling urgency for VA patient treatment, as authorized under FAR 6.302-2. 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See Item 5 above. A notice will not be publicized because it is not required according to FAR 5.202(a) (2) Unusual and Compelling.

The proposed contract action is made under the conditions prescribed in FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Purchase Order awarded using the FAR authority cited above is supported by the written justification contained herein (Item No.5) prescribed by FAR 6.304 and made after award when its preparation and approval prior to the award of the Purchase Order would unreasonably delay the acquisition of Dental Assistants and Hygienists services needed to avert interruption of such services to VA patients in need of care.  The minimum period of performance, seven months, will not exceed the time necessary for the VA to enter into another  five year Blanket Purchase Agreement for the required services through the use of full and open competitive procedures to as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. 

Specifically, as part of the acquisition plan and milestones for a long-term contract, the initial market research and survey of FSS holders will be expanded to seek and solicit as many potential sources as practicable from the GSA database of FSS holders under the GSA eLibrary category of 621-035 Professional and Allied Healthcare Staffing Services - Dental Hygienists Services.  In the course of such research and survey, a source sought notice or combined synopsis-solicitation will be publicized in eBuy for the required services.

7. Anticipated Cost:  The anticipated dollar value for the contract action is for approximately $167,648.00.   The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on historical price analysis. Market research and analysis of the current contract in place for Dental Assistants and Dental Hygienists provide evidence of fair and reasonable pricing.

8. Results of Market Survey: Market Research was conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10 to determine the commercial availability and potential sources for the services of Dental Assistants and Dental Hygienists to perform services in accordance VAGLAHS requirements. A search of GSA Advantage, there was four other Contractors listed on the FSS which could provide the required services:

		
Company Name	GSA Contract 	Expiration Date	Ceiling Price Dental Assistant	Ceiling price
Dental Hygienist
Dental Power International, INC.	V797P-40044	11/30/2018	$31.88	$61.34
NiteLines USA, Inc	V797P-7324A	2/29/2016	$28.50	$53.00
Spectrum Healthcare Resources, INC	V797P-2290d	10/31/2017	$32.32	$71.72
All Medical Personnel	V797P-7198A	3/31/2014	$28.00	$55.00
Aerotek Scientific, LLC	V797D-30101	02/24/2018	$33.80	---


9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: If there is any delay in this award, this would create a shortage of dental assistants and compound the current VAGLAHS Dental Department  patient  access issues for eligible dental patients  including  the entitled veterans in the Homeless Veterans Dental Initiative Program.  Also, these delays and staffing shortfalls could create potential safety, infection control and reusable medical/dental equipment issues with this reduced ancillary support.

10. Any Other Interested Sources:   Due to the lengthy processes of finding qualified candidates and for each selected individual to obtain security clearance and access (including obtaining  the required PIV Card), it is not effective/ feasible to solicit other  potential sources/ vendors at this time.  This prolonged time gap and absence of necessary dental auxiliary staff would negatively impact patient care.  The span of this contract will ensure continuity of support while a long term contract is being finalized.


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: Any subsequent solicitation will be issued on a competitive basis, because it is anticipated that enough time will be allowed for the Government to implement the entire procurement process, including availability to utilize full and open competition from among potential contractors.

12. Requirements Certification:  Certification required of the requestor for a statement of Bona Fide Need for the Department of Veterans Affairs and its supporting data, under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete, to the best of my knowledge and belief. Data in support of the requirement, its accuracy and completeness, is contained in the "Approval Memorandum" (Certifications as required by VA Directive 1663).  

 









13. Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304:


a.	Contracting Officer's Certification:   I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
