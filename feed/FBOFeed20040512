<DESC>This announcement constitutes a synopsis of an upcoming FDA solicitation. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The  NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.
	
This procurement will be a fixed price, indefinite-quantity indefinite-delivery contract with a one-year base plus two, 1-year options.  The major objectives to be accomplished under this contract are to provide FDA with: 1) Immediate automated access to a currently existing, pediatric inpatient data resource with the capability of providing counts of discharges and/or patients utilizing drugs in childrens hospitals, and characterizing the hospitalization episode; 2) Direct, unlimited access to data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and 3) The ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.  The data resource shall contain information from a minimum of 25 pediatric hospitals, and must be commercially available as of July 1, 2004.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to provide the data as well as the means to access the data.  For purposes of this synopsis a pediatric hospital is defined as an institution which is organized and operated for the care of individuals who are usually less than 18 years of age, and who are being treated for conditions that normally require a stay of 30 days or less.  The data provided shall meet the need of the FDA to access discharge-level and/or patient-level data describing pediatric inpatient drug use in childrens hospitals.  The size and characteristics of the population of hospitals from which the data are derived shall be provided to the FDA.  Characterizing of the sample shall minimally include: number of hospitals, size of hospitals, geographic diversity of hospitals, number of discharges per year, demographic distribution of discharges in the sample, types of hospitals and a description of specialty units within sample hospitals. Also, if available, the FDA would like to know the number of unique patients hospitalized per year in the sample and their demographic distribution. The FDA has no interest in knowing the identity of any patient, provider, or hospital included in the data resource.  It shall be solely the Contractors responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  In addition, the following information shall be provided: 1) the number of years of valid data available overall and in real time; 2) the ability and ease of accessing data that is no longer on-line; 3) the lag time between the date of service for the hospitalization and on-line availability of the data; and 4) data collection and management procedures.  These characteristics are essential for determining whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available.  The inpatient data shall be amenable to analysis at the discharge-level and/or patient-level.  Age and gender of the patient at hospitalization shall be required.   Hospitalization episode data shall be required, and shall include the dates of hospitalization, the length of stay, all diagnoses related to the hospitalization, all procedures, and discharge disposition. Data related to drug prescriptions in hospital shall be required for all drugs administered during the hospitalization episode, and shall include the generic and established name for the drug, strength, and dosage form.  A complete data dictionary shall also be included.
Also, if available, the FDA would like to know information on race/ethnicity of hospitalized patients, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  The FDA would additionally like the following information relating to the hospitalization episode, if available: operating room and radiology procedure and drug data (anesthetics, contrast agents, etc.), microbiology data (cultures, sensitivities, antigen testing, etc.), information on admitting diagnosis, drugs at admission, and drugs at discharge.  The FDA would like the following drug-related information, if available, for all administered drugs: date administered, treatment dose, and treatment duration.

As part of the evaluation process offerors shall provide a trial subscription and technical documentation for four individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purpose of evaluation.  During the trial subscription period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purpose of evaluation of the data resource.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.

The RFP will be posted to this website on May 17, 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Raytheon Company of Upper Marlboro, MD to provide an integrated enhancement to the existing high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, NJ under Contract Number 50-DDNR-0-90030.  The Government intends to modify the existing contract to acquire additional processing capability, storage, networking, software, and services in support of the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).  The existing HPC system was designed by Raytheon Company to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but separate resources for analysis, storage, and networking as well.  The current system consists of a Large Scale Cluster (total of 2432 SGI Origin 3800 and 3900 processors), an Analysis Cluster (total of 192 SGI processors), an HFS/HSMS Cluster (total of 128 SGI Origin 3800 processors), and a tape library (4 STK 9310 Powderhorn silos).  Raytheon also provides system administration and other system related support services under the contract.  The current system shares a single integrated set of file systems under SGI's clustered file system (CXFS) and data archives under SGI's Data Migration Facility (DMF).  All of the system's resources are managed and scheduled by Raytheon's Grid Engine resource management and scheduling software.  The HPC system currently utilized by GFDL directly supports NOAA's strategic goals in Climate and Weather and Water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth's climate and weather.  Under CCSP, GFDL will be responsible for providing routine, on-demand state-of-the-science model-based global projections of future climate resulting in  demands greater than what the current HPC system can provide.  To support the increased computational requirements for climate research generated by CCSP, the existing HPC system must be augmented to provide additional computational resources, storage capacity, and system support services, including both hardware and software maintenance, through the end of the contract (September 2006).   These additional resources must be integrated into the existing HPC system architecture.  The estimated budget for the CCSP enhancement is approximately $9 million through September 2006.  NOAA anticipates leasing the additional hardware and software.   Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system enhancement capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  Seamless integration of the CCSP enhancement into the existing HPC system architecture is required, including integration into GFDL's current hierarchical storage management system.  Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of the system enhancement without any interruption or degradation of performance both during the actual system upgrade as well as during the remainder of the system's life (through September 2006).  Vendors must include in its response, an explanation, in explicit detail, of its plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing HPC system.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis.  SEE Note 22.

<DESC>The goal of the C2 and CS Program is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and support ongoing Naval Enterprise capability enhancements.  This will be accomplished by supporting science and technology enablers for decision making and mission execution to achieve battlespace superiority.  In current and future operational environments, warfighters will require technologies evolved to support information needs regardless of location and consistent with the users level of command or responsibility and operational situation.  The Programs primary focus is in the development of hardware and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multi-media products including images; integrate the massive amounts of information that will be generated in future environments; and provide automatic correlation, fusion, and decision aids to support user-cognitive processes.  This program addresses current warfighter functionality shortfalls in information integration resulting from limitations in technology.  The C2 and CS Program will focus on advanced or novel approaches for automated image understanding and automated processes for recognizing target feature information; processing and integration of information from disparate sources; optimal decision aids incorporating rigorous decision theory and automated inference and reasoning; and assuring information integrity and availability according to mission objectives.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Negiotations will be conducted with Lawrence S. Lewin, Executive Consultant and the CDC, National Centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP).  The first strategic retreat was held in January, 2004.  To maintain continuity of facilitation NCCDPHP requires the advice and council of the same noted health policy and management facilitator; continuity of operations and direction is critical to the success of previous efforts.    

BACKGROUND:  The National Centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) has the responsibility of researching and promoting effective prevention strategies.  Many of these strategies can be initiated in community-based settings where social interaction provides support and encouragement for individuals who are engaged in modifying unhealthy behaviors and to promote healthy living.  Leadership within NCCDPHP have planned a series of retreats/strategic planning sessions to identify, assess, and then implement new directions for the Center in response to new challenges, knowledge, technologies and fiscal priorities.  The first strategic retreat was held in January 2004 with a focus on taking a fresh and challenging look at current programs and priorities, brainstorming about possible new directions, priorities, pathways and partners.  The expected end result of this retreat will be the development of 5-10 strategic directions NCCDPHP may take that are likely to have the greatest impact on the health of the public.  The second retreat to develop the chosen strategic directions will take place in March 2004.

PURPOSE:  This acquisition is to continue to obtain professional facilitation services from a noted health policy and management facilitator services for the NCCDPHP futures working group.  These sessions are a follow-up to a retreat held in January 2004 to review, expand upon, and develop techniques and plans to implement new strategic directions in response to new challenges, knowledge, technologies, and fiscal priorities. The facilitator will guide the futures workgroup in reviewing, selecting, and elaborating on the priority issues emerging from the retreat held in January 2004.  In addition, the workgroup will decide on the scope of the next stage of planning  i.e. a full strategic plan or further development of the strategic plan or further development of the strategic priorities. The workgroup will also develop detailed plans for the remaining process to include a steering committee, organization or strategic taskforce

To maintain continuity of facilitation, direction, advice, and instruction, NCCDPHP requires the advice and council of the same noted health policy and management facilitator who maintains a background in working with Federal agencies in areas relevant to chronic disease prevention and health promotion such as community health, population health and health among disparate populations.  In addition, the facilitator must possess unique experiences and knowledge in the strategic development of chronic disease programs that embrace cardiovascular prevention, cancer prevention, diabetes management that reach the public, engage health systems, collaborate with businesses and promote worksite health promotion, and improves accountability, outcomes measurements, and continued surveillance.  The health policy and management facilitator will provide guidance and advice as NCCDPHP senior managers develop new directions, priorities, pathways and partnerships in chronic disease prevention and health promotion.  The health policy and management facilitator will finally provide direction in the development of the newly chosen strategic directions from the previous retreat that senior management believes will have the greatest impact of the health of the public.

SPEIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

<DESC>SYNOPSIS


SYNOPSIS.  This solicitation is being issued as an 8(a) Set-Aside.  This is a two-step design/build construction renovation project,  Request for Proposals, Number N68950-04-R-0029.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required for the design and construction effort for the repair of all interior and exterior structures at the first floor, basement and mezzanine areas of Building 5, Naval Station Great Lakes, Great Lakes, IL.  The interior work includes repairing/replacing the interior walls, flooring, ceiling, doors, heads, plumbing, HVAC/sprinkler systems, electrical, HAZMAT, and related work. The exterior work includes the replacement of deteriorated stairs, terra cotta pieces, brick work, coping, flashing, roofing, lintels, windows and doors and frames, loading dock and overhead doors, concrete steps, lights and related work. Tuck-pointing and caulking will be required for all masonry and other exterior joints. Sidewalk repair will also be required. The building is considered a historical building. The estimated cost of the entire project is in the range of $4,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. The NAICS Code is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.) The Small Business size standard is $28.5 million. The government desires the number of days for completion for the design and renovation of the facility not-to-exceed 270 calendar days (90 days for design and design approval and 180 days for the actual construction effort.)  

The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by FAR section 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases and can be summarized as follows:

Phase I.  Proposals will be evaluated on:
a.  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience for the Design & 
Construction Teams.
b.  Technical Qualifications (Design/Construction and Management Approach)

Phase II.  A maximum of five (5) offerors will advance to Phase II.  The Proposals will be evaluated on:
a.  Technical Proposal
b.  Price Proposal

A solicitation for phase 1 is expected to be released by May 25, 2004 with a closing date of June 25, 2004.  We anticipate issuing the Phase 2 RFP by July 29, 2004. Contractor proposals for phase 2 will be due approximately 30 calendar days after RFP issue date.  After receipt of phase 2 proposal packages, the Government may choose to award based on this initial proposal without discussions.  If required, in accordance with FAR 15.306, clarifications and discussions may be enacted, and a final revised proposal will  be requested.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offers at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; to award to the offeror submitting the highest technically rated or the lowest total price proposal and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to be the most advantageous Best Value to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  

Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the offerors will be required to submit technical solutions and a price proposal for the project.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the project and other submittals that address factors defining the quality of construction.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price, including evaluation of scope/design options within the Governments published budget for award.  The BEST VALUE proposal for the project will be awarded the project.   Unsuccessful offerors participating in Phase II of the project will not be eligible to receive stipends or compensation for proposal preparation costs. Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.   All prospective offerors and plan rooms MUST register themselves on the website.  The official planholders list will be created from the internet registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method of distributing amendments, therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.

<DESC>The National Gallery of Art (NGA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Honeywell, Inc. for the upgrade of an existing Honeywell Building Automation System (BAS), purchased from Honeywell in 1995.  

Under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, Honeywell, Inc., is capable of successful completion of this software upgrade.

Sole source determination is based on the following: Under the original award, Honeywell installed its Excel Building Supervisor (XBS) software.  The XBS software is a proprietary product, and integration of an equivalent vendors equipment without a complete overhaul of the existing system is unfeasible given Honeywells strict licensing policies.  This software controls systems so vital to the Gallerys mission that it is unacceptable to risk a system failure resulting from complications in the upgrade process. 

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses to this notice will be accepted until May 21, 2004.  A determination by the Gallery not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the Gallerys discretion.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for improvements to the current liquid air back pack system currently in use for space suit testing activities in remote field locations.  The effort required by this action will provide two enhanced and modified Liquid Air Packs (LAP) with the following functional capabilities: 1) enable simultaneous test activities by a pair of space suited test subjects; 2) achieve higher fidelity test and extend test time duration by upgrading the 2 LAPS to provide the capability to be re-chargeable from a supply source while the space suited test subjects are still using the LAPs; and, 3) incorporate appropriate sensors to monitor the helath and performance charateristics of the LAP units.	 NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Oceaneering Space Sytems (OSS) in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  OSS is the only responsible source capable of completing the necessary upgrades to the LAP because this is highly specialized equipment originally developed by OSS for the hazardous materials industry.  The design of the original liquid air backpack system is proprietary to OSS.  The improvements, enhancements, and modifications will be based on OSS' unique proprietary design and operational experience.  Since OSS designed and fabricated the original liquid air backpack system, they are currently the only known source with the level of expertise, background experience, and necessary tooling and manufacturing techniques to be able to fabricate these replacement liquid air backpack configurations. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 21, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) Radiation Protection Division (RPD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Perspectives Group, Inc. (PGI)  of Alexandria, VA under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The purpose of this acquisition is to support EPA's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) recertification outreach activities. In 1998 EPA issued a certification decision that stated that the WIPP  facility will comply with EPA's radioactive waste standards. EPA is required to reevaluate and recertify the WIPP's compliance every five years. Under this Purchase Order, PGI shall provide expert support to implement the WIPP Recertification Communications Plan and conduct public forums in New  Mexico to obtain comments on the WIPP recertification application and process with stakeholders and the public. In addition, PGI shall assist in the development of print and web-based material that effectively communicates EPA's certification process and final decision. Under this Purchase Order,  PGI shall support EPA's ongoing WIPP outreach activities to include: development  and implementation of a strategy for informing communities near transuranic waste generator sites; assisting in the translation of complex technical information and issues into products that are easy for the general  public to comprehend; designing print and web-based graphics for clear communication of EPA's ongoing regulatory role at WIPP; and to identify opportunities for heightened clarity and completeness of EPA's current WIPP materials. PGI is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement due  to its ability to develop and implement  communications strategies for highly controversial projects, its history of building successful partnerships in such scenarios, and its current work on supporting Agency efforts to redesign and implement public outreach and communications for WIPP  certification.  It has been determined that because of a 6-month statutory deadline for EPA to render a final recertification decision, in accordance with the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act, PGI is the only vendor with in-depth technical knowledge of EPA's recertification process that can satisfy this  requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if  received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should  be directed to Contracting Officer Kathryn Barton via e-mail at barton.kathryn@epa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of integrating a Combat Identification capability into an advanced targeting pod.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of integrating a sensor to interrogate an Athena RF tag into an advanced targeting pod.  The envisioned system should integrate light weight radar such as Lynx that is capable of communicating with an RF tag.  Given that capability, Coalition Combat Air Forces could identify friendly ground forces  from assets equipped with targeting pods in a battlefield environment.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEF Battlelab is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce and certify an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating the capability to design and integrate a small, lightweight radar capable of interrogating an Athena RF tag into existing USAF targeting pods.  The system should be capable of displaying the tag data on the aircraft Multifunction Display (MFD) or an equivalent display. The Athena RF tag is a dual band device designed by Sandia National Laboratories capable of receiving a radar signal and reflecting the waveform with embedded data. The Athena tag is currently being developed and evaluated in the ongoing AEF Battlelabs Alert Data Embedded Passive Tag (ADEPT) Initiative which is part of the US Armys Radar Tag Engagement (RaTE) Program.  The RaTE program has two focuses; Blue Force Tracking and Coalition Combat Identification. 

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN 14 June 2003 to Lt Col Sobrero, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Lt Col Sobrero can be reached at (208) 828-3506.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI).  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is considering the introduction of state of the art Data Services into the Global Information Grid Services (GIG) Core Enterprise Services (CES) Architecture.
DISA is seeking information from industry on state of the art Data Services Technologies architectures, and products that supports the Mediation, Discovery, Publication, Subscription, Content Management, Security, Messaging, Applications, User Assistant, Storage, Collaboration, and Enterprise Services Management CES to ensure that it has considered all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that provide this capability. This RFI includes but is not limited to software specifications to include: data management tools, interface software, data catalogs, formatting tools, data quality control, metadata management, translation and correlation capabilities, data rates, throughput.  All manufacturers and suppliers Data Services technology are offered this opportunity to show how to best employ their software in the GIG Infrastructure.
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. However, this RFI will be the basis for collecting information on products available, and as a result of information received, the government may enter into Product Loan Agreements for trial and testing of products identified. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition   process for the Data Technology products. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
1.INTRODUCTION: Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES). The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and War-fighting domains, as well as interfaces with the national Intelligence Community (IC) domain.
As the enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is   the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely. This new environment must:
(1)  Support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible,
(2)  Alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission, 
(3)  Provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commanders information management policy, 
(4)  Ensure information assurance (IA)/security, 
(5)  Support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  
NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for exchange of information with the Core Enterprise Services (CES) and the Community of Interest (CoI) capabilities. Data Services is an inherent component of NCES and the CES are dependent upon a robust set these services to support the domains and CoIs.     
The NCES facilitates data sharing and reuse of the many redundant, dissimilar, but overlapping, data stores used in legacy applications by making use of a set of standard NCES compliant data services engineered from components that blend multiple data technologies. To do this, the data engineering team provides architectural definition of data services that support discovery, data access, mediation, collaboration, security, content management and ESM services. NCES defines the data management services, support tools, engineering support services, and legacy data migration guidance for system developers and administrators and end user applications on the network that will enable both horizontal fusion and vertical integration of data sources. These tools and services allow easy organization and publication of existing data components to encourage reuse and migration away from application-centric data stores to NCES data management services. These services will provide the ability to post information to public space, advertise requirements, advertise service offerings, publish content in easily accessible form, precision discovery of needed information efficient pull and reliable subscription, alerts, tip-offs, notifications of significant events collaboration among geographically dispersed team(s) asynchronous (intermittently connected) operations, expanded messaging capability, and comprehensive help. Under the NCES, application developers use common data-related services rather than re-implementing them for each application. NCES shall use COTS products, relational database management systems (RDBMS), message-oriented middle-ware, and GOTS products (metadata registries) to provide mainline data services. NCES emphasizes coordinated management of the sharable data structures and semantics employed within heterogeneous data product frameworks. 
The purpose of this RFI is to perform market research. Information from industry is required for planning purposes about COTS software products that enable the government to define a comprehensive set of data service requirements.  The requirements shall be used to formulate a strategy for development and integration of the CES defined in NCES. Since NCES is a data centric program, the government requests information concerning Data Services Technologies software for the Mediation, Discovery, Publication, Subscription, Content Management, Security, Messaging, Applications, User Assistant, Storage, Collaboration, and Enterprise Services Management services of the GIG. These services are defines as follows:

<DESC>Negotiations are being conducted on a sole source basis with OptTek Systems, Inc. for combining mathematical statistics and mathematical optimization to address problems in survey methodology.

 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

 

The National Center for Health Statistics releases a variety of data products in the format of statistical tables.  These tabulations are derived from information collected by NCHS on individual persons or establishments.  A typical survey can involve a large number of interrelated higher-dimensional tables, making analysis and assessment complex.  There exist a variety of statistical methods, notably iterative proportional fitting, log linear models, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, for analysis or adjustment of tabular data.  A variety of important problems in survey methodology, notably statistical disclosure limitation, data editing, and multi-way stratified survey sampling, have been formulated as mathematical optimization models.  It is worthwhile to bridge these two methodologies to create stronger, unified survey methods.

 

 

OBJECTIVE

 

The objective of this contract is to investigate theoretical, mathematical modeling and computational issues relevant to connecting mathematical optimization models with statistical sampling and analysis methods for statistical tables, and their efficient implementation in prototype mathematical software.  Existing theoretical methods, based on the mathematical theory of Gröbner bases, appear to demand unreasonable computations.  This will be investigated, but in addition computationally efficient exact and approximate methods based on mathematical programming will be explored.  Immediate applications to NCHS and survey methodology are (1) confidentiality protection and producing confidentiality-protected adjusted tabular data, and (2) connecting data editing with data imputation.  The software, with documentation, will be made available to the NCHS Research Data Center and data divisions for their evaluation of the practical utility of the methods, as a tool for evaluating data disclosure and edit procedures in current use, and for consideration for adoption.  It will also be made available to the federal statistical community for broader evaluation.  The Office of Research and Methodology will use the software as a test bed for further research in these and related areas.  The resulting research and methods will be presented in published papers and software documentation for the benefit of the survey methodology community.

 

SCOPE OF WORK

 

Utilizing their expertise in mathematical programming methods, confidentiality protection and other statistical operations on statistical tables, and the development of related user-friendly mathematical programming software, the contractor will assist Dr. Cox in theory and methods research and produce user-friendly prototype software, with documentation, as follows.

 

1.  Contractor will assist Dr. Cox in research on the theory, methods and heuristics for combining linear and integer programming and mathematical search methods with statistical sampling and table adjustment methods, focused on confidentiality protection and data edit and imputation for statistical data presented in tabular form.  This will require considerable expertise and the ability to work with Dr. Cox on the development of efficient mathematical programming formulations and heuristics for solving such problems.

 

2.  Contractor will assist Dr. Cox in producing two manuscripts of final-draft quality, with appropriate graphs, figures and tables, that (a) summarizes the research, data simulations and survey methodology outcomes from 1., and (b) summarize the algorithms and operations research applications from 1.  The papers should be suitable for publication in a professional (a) mathematical statistics and (b) operations research journal.

 

3.  Contractor will develop and deliver to NCHS efficient end-user prototype software implementing the results of the research in 1., with appropriate documentation.

 

This work will involve development of mixed integer linear programming, quadratic programming and direct search methods and software combined with appropriate statistical sampling and survey methods.   Contractor will supply for this purpose in subroutine form suitable mathematical programming optimizers that deals efficiently with problems of this type.  Optimizers will be free of any software purchase costs and licensing fees, in order that the software products produced by the contractor be shared widely among NCHS staff and other survey methodologists.

 

All software will be developed in the Visual C++ language for IBM PC and PC compatible computers and should execute efficiently under Visual C++ in a Windows 2000 environment.  Source and executable code and technical and user documentation will be provided to NCHS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The 155mm M241/M242 propelling charges  known as Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) are two different propelling  charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete  zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic  increment.  During development and fielding of the MACS Charge, the U.S. Army  TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale displays  and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction,  packaging and field application.  The M241 charges are used at lower zones  (Zones 1 & 2), while the M242 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3 through 6.  The training aids include production of thirty (30) M242 and thirty (30) M242 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in their metal ammunition storage container.  Since the soldiers will be trained on the  cutaways, it is required that they are of the same quality and construction as the live version using inert materials.  Before submitting the drawing  requirement, the cutaway training aid can be seen at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ by  submitting a request to lchang@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-7402. The offeror is  required to include product marking and assembly drawings showing detailed  design and construction of the M241 and M242 sectioned Training Aids. The  offeror shall also provide a plan detailing receipt of raw materials and  manufacturing of the M241 and M242 Training Aids.  The offeror shall include  drawing(s) and plan in their proposal to the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC for  approval.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical  Technologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to  DoD Directives 5230.224 and 5230.25. Request all information be submitted via  electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil, Margaret Rhinesmith, (973)  724-3050.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194 to provide non-personal services.  Services include aerosol system and swatch testing to support developmental tes t programs, system and swatch testing support of method development and provide technical expertise on existing aerosol testing of chemical and biological individual protective equipment.  This support will include facilities and labor for conduct of testi ng, labor intellectual support, travel and some documentation preparation as required.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, supplies, services, and/or equipment required are available from one responsible source a nd no other type of supplies, services, and/or equipment will satisfy agency requirements.  This action requires FAR 6.302-1 authority because Research Triangle Inc. (RTI) is the only organization certified by the Chemical Defense Equipment Process Action Team (CDE PAT) to conduct aerosol testing of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) for the Department of Defense.  The CDE PAT was formed after the 1991 Gulf war by Mr. Hollis the deputy undersecretary of the Army for Operations Research (DUSA-OR) to look at the state of chemical defense equipment testing within the armed services.  As part of this initiative an Aerosol, Vapor, Liquid Action Group (AVLAG), comprised of key personnel from the development, test and evaluation communities, was established to r eview procedures and develop new test protocols.  The AVLAG developed swatch, MIST and Aerosol methods, which were later validated by the National Science Foundation.  The Aerosol test method was only developed and validated at RTI, and ever since they hav e performed all aerosol testing in support of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) development.  It is necessary to continue to have RTI conduct this testing in support of near term IPE developmental testing since no other test site could attain verificat ion within the timeframe required to enable these programs to meet their schedule.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Supporting evidence must be f urnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with sole source negotiations with RTI.

OFFERORS PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: CLIN 0001 AND 0004; Quantity: 1 EA.; WITHIN __________ MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.  However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically.  (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Inspection and acceptance will be by representatives of the Iraqi Republic Railway within 30 days of product installation and prove out.  Delivery will be FOB Baghdad Central Station, Iraq (grid zone coordinates:  MB 42252 87280).  

The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to OfferorsCommercial, as well as the following instructions:  Offerors shall submit information on their past performance in like or similar acquisitions in the last three years.

Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  Attachments are allowed but shall be limited to a total of thirty (30) pages.  A page that has material on back and front will count as two pages.  The contracting officer may determine proposals that deviate from these type-size and page limitations as non-responsive.  Offerors shall submit an original proposal and one copy.  The proposal shall be easily segregated between the technical quote, past performance, and contract line items (CLINs) price, which shall be quoted in US dollars.

Other rooms needed besides the general session room and breakouts will be a Press room (with fax machine and telephone for several press handling this meeting) and an office for the staff (with a copier and telephone).

****ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Most of the work is matching the furniture that is already installed and a reconfiguration.  The work is for Peterson AFB Building 920, Room A-108.  The building is the Combined Intelligence Fusion Center.  The specific room is the Intelligence System Division, Intelligence Systems Governance Branch.  This is a limited access building.  There is also some work in 11300, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (Intelligence System Division (Intelligence Network Operations Center)).  For Building, 920 PAFB:  It is a first floor room.  There is an elevator in the Building.  A truck can drive up to the loading area, on the opposite of the building.  This is an existing building.  For Building 11300, CMAFS:  This is a third floor room, there is an elevator.  But access is extremely limited.  Sometimes trucks must be unloaded in the parking lot, then the material moved by handcart (1/2 mile) into CMAFS.  If coordination is made, trucks (if proper size) are allowed into CMAFS to the loading dock, or a fork-lift may be made available.  Expect lots of delays and standing around.  As far as "or equal" products, specified products should match our existing products.****

<DESC>AMENDMENT 3 AND AN UPDATED PLANHOLDERS LIST HAS BEEN POSTED AT WWW.FEDTEDS.GOV.     



ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the prime contractor.  The trade-off process is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Companys Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposals acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnels  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities  the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

Using your current production or anticipated design(s) as a technical  starting point, what would be the minimum timeframe, including long lead  procurement, and minimum number of test assets that would be required to  design, integrate, test, ensure adequate production capacity, and produce four  LRIP aircraft in both of the configurations listed above? PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-F33615-99-2-5215

<DESC>Introduction: Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate (AFRL/ML), reannounces the award of the Core Metals Affordability Initiative (Core MAI), Agreement Number F33615-99-2-5215. This Initiative is a joint effort of the Air Force Research Laboratorys Materials and Manufacturing Directorate and a Consortium made up of raw material producers, component suppliers, designers, assemblers, and original equipment manufacturers, currently: The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Brush-Wellman, Carpenter Technology Corporation, Dynamet, Honeywell Incorporated, Ladish Co. Inc., Howmet Corporation, ALLVAC, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, PCC Structurals Inc., Rolls-Royce Allison, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Special Metals Corporation, Titanium Metals Corporation, and Pratt & Whitney. 

Presently Pratt & Whitney is the fiduciary agent or lead company (Recipient) for the Consortium and staffs a Program Office to support the Consortium.  It is noted that as a Cooperative Agreement this Award is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR). The Cooperative Agreement and its attached documents, and the Collaboration Agreement included all documents and procedures referenced herein may be obtained by contacting the MAI Program Office (Not from the POC listed above.) (Please see all the corresponding names, postal and electronic addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers as set forth in the documents that have been made available electronically at the addresses indicated herein.) 

The Core MAI Initiative is structured to facilitate the conduct of projects based upon the submittal and selection of White Papers setting forth projects that will further the goals stated herein.  The Materials Affordability Initiative Consortium (MAIC), in conjunction with AFRL/ML, is interested in receiving proposals (White Papers) on the technical efforts (Projects) described below. White Papers in response to this announcement shall be sent to the MAI Program Office at Pratt & Whitney (See Section F of this document for the Points of Contact and corresponding addresses) for receipt on or before 1500 Hours local (East Hartford) time, September 1, 2004, if the offeror wishes to have his/her White Paper considered for funding at the expected Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting. Offerors, who wish to submit White Papers later than September 1, 2004, can do so, 4 (four) months prior to the proposed start date of the project (with no end date of a project proposed to go past the completion date of the Core MAI Cooperative Agreement which is currently September 30, 2007).  However, because of uncertainty of funding approval cycles it is not known when the TOC committee will again meet to review and evaluate White Papers.  

No other solicitation is anticipated in regard to this requirement; but you are advised to monitor the Wright Research Site Contracting Office Web Site: http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/.
You are further advised to continue to monitor the CBD and FedBizOpps (Federal Business Opportunities Web Site (http://www.eps.gov/) for adjustments and updates, including possible changes in the performance period for which White Papers Projects may apply.

Potential submitters are put on notice that if an offeror is not a consortium member at the time its White Paper is submitted, it must be designated by the Air Force as a consortium member in accordance with the Government's established and objective criteria and procedures and must sign the Collaboration Agreement between the consortium members, or team with a Consortium Member before its White Paper may be evaluated for funding in accordance with the process described in the Proposal Evaluation Process (PEP) document.  New consortium members will participate with existing consortium members on the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") in the evaluation and scoring of White Papers as described in the PEP.  All White Papers received in response to the solicitation will be submitted to the MAI Program Office which, in turn (and, if the offeror is not currently a member of the Consortium, after (1) notification by the Air Force that the offeror has been admitted as a new Consortium Member under the relevant objective criteria and (2) the offeror has signed the Collaboration agreement), will forward copies to each member of the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") at least three (3) weeks prior to the collective TOC evaluation .

Detailed requirements, instructions, attachments and additional information that will aid in the preparation of white papers for "Core MAI' can be found at the Wright Research Site Contracting Office Home Page  'http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/' and/or at "EPS" (the Electronic Posting System 'http://www.eps.gov').

<RESPDATE>022504
<CONTACT>MARGARET RHINESMITH, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3050
<DESC>The previous notice is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety as follows. The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research,  Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is contemplating an award of a 100% small business set-aside  requirement to manufacture fullscale, inert M231 and M232 Training Aids that contain sectioned M241 and M242 charges in their corresponding sectioned  metal ammunition storage containers.  The 155mm M231/M232 propelling charges  known as Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) are two different propelling  charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete  zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic  increment.  During development and fielding of the MACS Charge, the U.S. Army  TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale displays  and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction,  packaging and field application.  The M231 charges are used at lower zones  (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3  through 6.  The training aids include production of thirty (30) M241 and thirty (30) M242 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in their metal ammunition storage container.  Since the soldiers will be trained on the  cutaways, it is required that they are of the same quality and construction as the live version using inert materials.  Before submitting the drawing  requirement, the cutaway training aid can be seen at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ by  submitting a request to lchang@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-7402. The offeror is  required to include product marking and assembly drawings showing detailed  design and construction of the M241 and M242 sectioned Training Aids. The  offeror shall also provide a plan detailing receipt of raw materials and  manufacturing of the M241 and M242 Training Aids.  The offeror shall include  drawing(s) and plan in their proposal to the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC for  approval.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical  Technologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by  the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to DoD  Directives 5230.224 and 5230.25. Request all information be submitted via  electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil, Margaret Rhinesmith, (973)  724-3050.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip,  http://www.winzip.com.  See Numbered Notes 1, 8, and 25.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT AMENDMENT:  M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mines; M18A1E1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mines, which is a variant that uses a non-electrical initiation system (M18A1E1); its trainer (M68E1); and the M5 Modular Crowd Control Munition (MCCM) .  T he solicitation (when written), will be written to include multiple years (i.e. basic contract with 4 options) and will utilize range pricing and Best Value criteria.  The composition C4 explosive for the munition and the M7 Antipersonnel Mine Bandoleer wi ll be GFM.   The current M18A1 (NSN 1345-00-710-6946, DODAC 1345-K143, P/N 8835166) consists of the M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104) and an electrical initiation system all packed for field use in an M7 Bandoleer. The electrical initiation system of the M 18A1 consists of an M4 electrical blasting cap with integral 100 foot wire extension (P/N 8836013), M57 Firing Device (P/N 8800924), and M40 Electrical Test Set (P/N 8800950). The M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104) consists of a molded plastic case approximately 22 cm wide, 14 cm high, and 6 cm thick that is formed to a slight arc along its vertical axis. The case is lined with a single layer of 700 steel balls in a resin matrix along the inside of the convex side. The remainder of the case is filled with approximately 0.75 kg of Composition C4 high explosive. Two folding, scissor-type steel legs are affixed to the bottom edge. Molded along the top edge are an aiming site and two cap wells that accept plastic combination shipping plug/blasting cap holders. The M4 electrical blasting cap with integral 100 foot wire extension (P/N 8836013) is a 100 foot length of two-conductor Type II AWG 18 wire with an integrated M4 electrical blasting cap connected at one end and a rubber-coated, two prong female connector (with shorting shipping plug) connected to the other. The electrical blasting cap mates with the combination shipping plug/blasting cap holder on the Weapon Body. Only one M4 is required to detonate the mine and may be inserted into either cap well. For sh ipping and storage, the 100 foot length of wire is wound around a hollow plastic spool with the blasting cap stored in the hollow hub. The M57 firing device (P/N 8800924) is a hand operated reusable detonator that generates electrical impulses sufficient to detonate the blasting cap. The M57 includes a spring loaded lever that couples the users gripping action to an armature assembly whic h, in turn, generates an electrical impulse of at least 15.3 milliwatt-seconds over a time period of less than 24 milliseconds. The M57 also includes a rubber-coated, two prong male connector (with shipping plug) that mates with and transmits the electrica l impulse to the M4 female connector. The M40 Electrical Test Set (P/N 8800950) provides the user with a means to perform an electrical check of both the M57 and M4. The M40 is a sheet metal case with approximate dimensions 4 x 4 x 9 cm. It includes rubber-coated, two-prong, male and female co nnectors (with shipping plugs) that mate with the M4 and M57 and an indicator lamp.  The M5 Modular Crowd Control Munition (MCCM, NSN: 1377-01-464-2606, DODIC: 1377-WA97, P/N: 12984475) is an area coverage, non lethal device that scatters .32 Cal PVC balls in an arc with an effective range of 5-15 meters. The M5 is outwardly similar to the  M18A1. This similarity is maintained as a psychological deterrent to hostile belligerents. The explosive load of the M5 consists of 12.5 grams of PETN sheet positioned behind two layers of 300 PVC balls each.  The munition is command detonated by the Mode rnized Demolition Initiator (MDI) which provides up to 100 feet of standoff. The non-electrical variant of the M18A1 (NSN TBD, P/N TBD) will be identical to the current M18A1 antipersonnel mine except expect it will incorporate a non-electric (MDI) initiation system instead of the electrical initiation used in the M18A1. The non-el ectric variant will include the M18A 1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104 as described above and shock-tube based initiation system all packed for field use in an M7 Bandoleer.  The non-electric initiation system used in non-electric M18A1 variant and the M5 will be similar to the M21 (NSN 1375-01-494-6945) which has been qualified under the Modernized Demolition Initiator (MDI) program. The M21 is a completely integrated system. It consists of a factory connected igniter at one end of a 500 foot length of shock tube (a plastic tube with its inside wall coated with mixture of HMX and aluminum power), and factory sealed non-electric blasting cap at the other end. The igniter initiat es the explosive mixture. The resulting shock propagates through the tube to activate the blasting cap at the other end. The non-electric initiation system will be identical to the M21 except it will use a shock tube of different length (100 feet) and nomi nal diameter (0.105 inches). This configuration (P/N 13006677) is currently undergoing certification as part of the M5 Modular Crowd Control Munition (MCCM). The M7 Antipersonnel Mine Bandoleer will still be utilized in the non-electric variant. However the instruction set attached to the Bandoleer will be updated to reflect the procedure for non-electric initiation. The TDP for the current M18A1 will be used once it is updated to cleanse obsolete and replaced specifications (Top Level Drawing D8837104). However the top level drawing (D8835166) will be updated to reflect the new configuration of the non-electric varian t. Drawings that refer to the M4 (D8836013), the M57 (D8800924), and the M40 (D8800950) will be removed and replaced by drawing of the non-electric initiation system for the non-electric variant TDP. Training aides shall include the current M68 (NSN 1345-00-402-402-2226, DODAC 1345-K139, P/N 9251503) which is the current M18A1 trainer and a new initiation system simulator for the non-electrical variant. The M68 includes the M33 Anti Personnel Practice Mine (P/N 9251501), M10 Practice Blasting Cap (P/N 9251499), M57 Firing Device, and M40 Electrical Test Set all packaged in the M7 Bandoleer. The M33 Anti Personnel Practice Mine has the same physical characteristics of the M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body  (P/N 8837104) except it is blue, has inert markings, and contains no explosive material. Similarly, the M10 is physically identical to the M4 except for a hole through the cup of the blasting cap and its absence of energetic material. The non-electrical initiation system simulator will be similar to the M22 (NSN 1375-01-494-6934, DODAC 1375-MN89) which has been qualified under the Modernized Demolition Initiator (MDI) program except the length of simulated shock tube will be 100 feet in stead of 500. Items in the family of directed munitions are produced using similar Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) processes. Press, crimp, adhesion, and other industrial processes are nearly identical and are preformed using common equipment. The processes used to produc e the M18A1 and M5 is illustrative of this commonality.  The outer cases of the M18A1 and M5 are identical except for markings and color of the rear case. Typically, munition cases are provided as GFM or procured by the load plant.  In the M18A1 the front outer case is pre-filled with the steel ball/epoxy matrix. The required amount of Composition C4 is press molded to a specific gravity of 1.6. The pre-formed explosive is placed into the front outer case; the back is then adhered to the loaded outer front case. Assembly is completed by inserting and crimping detonator cup wells. In the M5, a plastic bag containing the rubber ball matrix is placed in front case. The required amount of explosive is die cut from a sheet of Composition C3. The pre-formed explosive and foam spacer is placed behind the ball matrix, detonation wells are inserted and crimped, and the back is adhered to the loaded body.  M18A1 and M5 are packed identically. In both c ases the assembled munition along with its initiation system (which may be identical) are placed into separate pockets of the M7 Bandoleer. Six packed bandoleers are placed into a wire-bound crate. Except for requisite markings, the crates are identical.

Analytic areas include:  socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, costs and revenues, staffing, services provided, management of chronic diseases, and delivery of essential primary and preventive services.***The primary responsibilities of the recipient of this contract will be to provide knowledge, skills, and expertise to complete short-term analyses and provide a comprehensive, National picture of the health center program and all of its components.  The analyses are technically and methodologically complex and logistically extensive, but in most cases will be needed for decision making within very short time frames.***The organization must have extensive health center study experience of national scope that includes large scale, complex information gathering and analysis.  The organization must possess extensive experience in exploring innovative approaches to analyzing the latest health center data including that obtained from patient records of the Sentinel Center Network and patient responses from its recently conducted User/Visit Surveys.  The Offeror must possess in-depth knowledge and a proven capability to compare health center survey results with those of nationally conducted surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey by the National Center for Health Statistics.  The Offeror must also demonstrate experience in manipulating other large-scale national and international databases that demonstrate the relationship between the delivery of primary care services and improvements in health status, particularly for vulnerable populations.  Manipulation of survey and patient-level data require extensive knowledge of survey sampling weights and complex statistical techniques.  Yet the contractor must have a proven ability to translate complex statistical results into straightforward policy-relevant results.  Many of the tasks to be carried out in this contract will require expertise in manipulation of health center data, as well as in the multifaceted issues related to complex data analysis and policy.  The contractor must demonstrate its experience with existing national and health center databases, and health policy at the international, Federal, state and local levels.***Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any Capability Statements submitted, extensive experience with, and the ability to perform, the above tasks.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is planning on procuring services from a vendor that can provide a number of different products and/or services related to the harvesting of documents and publications from Web sites using Web crawler and data mining technologies. GPO is involved in a project that is attempting to discover and retrieve publications from Federal agency Web sites in order to identify publications that have not been cataloged by GPO but fall within the scope of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP).  GSA Schedule holders please provide yours GSA Number.

Background on the FDLP

The FDLP was established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information. Since 1813, depository libraries have safeguarded the public's right to know by collecting, organizing, maintaining, preserving, and assisting users with information from the Federal Government. The FDLP provides Government information at no cost to nearly 1,250 depository libraries throughout the country and territories. These depository libraries, in turn, provide local, no-fee access to Government information in an impartial environment with professional assistance. 

GPO manages the Cataloging and Indexing Program and is responsible for maintaining the Catalog of United States Government Publications (CGP). The CGP is comprised of bibliographic records of U.S. Government information products published by all three branches of the U.S. Government that are included in the FDLP. Bibliographic records are added daily to the CGP, with approximately 22,000 records added annually. CGP links users directly from bibliographic citations to electronic publications by using PURLs (Persistent Uniform Resources Locators) or by assisting the public in locating information in depository libraries and through the GPO Sales Program. GPO bibliographic data is also available to individual libraries directly from GPO and from a variety of commercial sources. This data can be used to populate local databases and public access catalogs with bibliographic citations for U.S. Government publications. 

GPO prepares machine-readable cataloging records (MARC) for the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) bibliographic network. The Cataloging Branch at GPO is the national authority for cataloging and bibliographic control of U.S. Government information products and is an active partner in all components of the National Program for Cooperative Cataloging. In addition, GPO prepares and adheres to the GPO Cataloging Guidelines, which provide specific guidance for cataloging complex and dynamic U.S. Government publications and are an essential resource for the Cataloging and Indexing Program. 








GPOs Web Harvesting Project

Over the past few years, GPO has become increasingly aware that many publications being published by Federal agencies are not being included in the FDLP; these documents have come to be known as fugitive publications. With increasing frequency, agencies are publishing information only in electronic formats and, when this occurs, they frequently fail to inform GPO of these new publications for inclusion in the FDLP and CGP. In addition, agencies sometimes procure their printing directly from private sector companies or use in-house facilities rather than coming to GPO and then fail to inform GPO of these publications, although there may be electronic counterparts on the publishing agency Web sites that could and should be included in the FDLP and CGP.  

In light of the large number of publications that have become fugitive, GPO is seeking Web crawler and data mining technologies that can provide a solution for the identification and harvesting of fugitive documents and publications from agency Web sites. In order to begin, GPO plans to launch a pilot project with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to crawl the primary EPA Web site and its sub-agency Web sites. The key capabilities GPO is seeking in relation to this project are as follows. The vendor must:

1.	Provide Web crawling and data mining technology that will locate, identify and capture all publications from all pages on the EPA Web site and its sub-agency Web sites that fall within the scope of the FDLP. These technologies must be able to:
	Identify publications in all possible formats, such as HTML, PDF, MS Word and Excel files, etc.
	Crawl the content of each publication, as well as external and internal metadata tied to each file.

2.	Based on criteria being developed by GPO for the characteristics that constitute a publication, build a set of rules and instructions for the crawler technology to capture only those documents that meet these criteria. This must include: 
	The capability to refine and revise rules and instructions over time as GPO gets further along the learning curve.
	Automated elimination of those publications retrieved by the crawler that do not fall within the scope of the FDLP based on GPOs set of criteria. 

3.	Provide automated comparison/collections analysis. Publications retrieved from the Web crawler and data mining technology will be matched against one or more publication databases provided by GPO, one of which will be based on MARC records cataloged for the FDLP and CGP.
	Technology must retain information in a database about all items previously harvested in order to avoid duplications from one crawl to another.

Respones should be submitted to Sheila Williams via mail no later than June 2, 2004, 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  Please include your name, address, phone number and fax number.

<DESC>MANL Master Transformational Plan Sources Sought Synopsis


Hill Air Force Base is looking to develop a contract for the transformation of the existing maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. This program will be to design, develop, construct, install, implement, and deliver a dramatically improved maintenance repair and overhaul process within exiting facilities. This program will transform the existing production environment from a process-oriented flow to a product oriented flow using the best cellular design methodology available. 

The program will institute lean cell technology and methodology within building 505, 507 and 510 at Hill Air Force Base Utah, which is responsible for the rebuilding and refurbishment of landing gear of C5, B1, KC 135, B52 C130, F16, F15, F4, T38, A10 landing gear, as well as future work loads to be defined. 

The objective of the program will be to improve the maintenance, repair and overhaul processes and facilitate change through transformational activities that increase product through put, reduce production cost, reduce inventory, and provide a process infrastructure for future work load within the current facility. This transformation will need to be accomplished while maintaining current production quotas as scheduled to meet AFMC requirements. During the design and implementation of this effort, the Air Force and the contractor will serve as a fully integrated team involved in all aspects of this effort. While the contractor will serve as the prime contractor in this effort, the OO-ALC transformational team will serve as the overarching decision making body.

<CONTACT>Jacquelyn D. Harris, 703 697-7964
<DESC>RFI: The Defense Contracting Command Washington (DCCW) is interested in finding sources to provide services to improve military postal operations.  This is a request for information, not a formal solicitation as part of our efforts to conduct market research. The draft SOW is included with this transmission for your review.   The draft Statement of Work (SOW) covers the development, testing, and deployment of an accurate personal address database and transmit time tracking system for improvements to the Militar y Postal System.  Any changes made to the system must be compatible with the United States Postal System (USPS) address systems, in coordination with the existing Military Postal Service AgencyÃ¢ÂÂs system.  Potential sources must develop a methodology f or inputting the military members address system or perhaps a system for each military member to input their own address system.  The Government is looking for innovative approaches and ideas.  Once the approach or methodology for acquiring the address of each overseas military personnel has been determined, the contractor will assist with the development and implementation of a standardized address system compatible with the USPS address system requirements and their address Management System (AMS) and Pos tal Automated Redirect System (PARS).  In addition, the contractor will be required to improve on the current Military Origin Destination System (MODIS).  MODIS is capable of capturing mail transit times from the USPS gateway to most servicing military pos t offices.   In addition, the SOW may be obtained by email from:  Jackie Harris, Contract Specialist, email Jacquelyn.Harris@hqda.army.mil, (703) 697-7964; or Gregory Young, Contracting Officer, (703) 614-2636; Youngge@hqda.army.mil ; OR from the DCCW webpage:  http:// dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil, click on Services, click on   Sources Sought.  You are requested to submit your ideas, comments, and questions with respect to the SOW by close of business 28 May 04.    Your submission should also include information about your firmÃ¢ÂÂs experience along with your ideas about how you would approach the tasks in the SOW and an estimate of the level of effort it might take to perform the services (cost or budge associated your approach) listed in the SOW.  Your submission should be mailed to: Department of the Army Defense Contracting command-Washington (DCCW) Attn:  Jacquelyn Harris 5200 Army Pentagon Room 1C243 Washington, DC  20310 It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued within one to three months after revisions to the SOW and the requirement if further defined.      The revisions to the SOW may include a wide variety of comments obtained from market research.   Draft Statement of Work:  Military Postal System Improvements 1.	Background. 1.1.	The Department of Defense has a moral obligation to ensure that every Service member and civilian assigned to duties and locations away from their home of record receives mail in a timely manner.  DoD operates the Military Postal System overseas as an  extension of the United States Postal Service under the authority of U.S.C. Title 39. 1.2.	For this Statement of Work, improvements to Military Mail Installations will only be for overseas (OCONUS, Outside the Continental United States) installations with the following exceptions: Guam, Puerto Rico, and Kwajalein.  The exceptions are operat ed by the MPS in conjunction with the USPS. 1.3.	As an extension of the USPS, the Military Postal Service must follow all USPS regulations and procedures.  This includes all Military Postal Financing, which covers the laws and regulations governing the collection and reporting of postage and special  services.  For the purposes of this Statement of Work, mail processing and delivery includes mail that is either going to or coming from overseas (OCONUS, with the exceptions listed in 1.1).  Mail going from the US (CONUS, Continental United Sta tes) is processed by the USPS until it reaches one (1) of the three (3) major Military Gateways located in New York, San Francisco, or Miami.  The gateways process and dispatch Military Mail via airline carries and/or surface carriers to designated Aerial Mail Terminals and Fleet Mail Terminals.  These terminals are operated and supervised by Military Postal Personnel.  From the terminals, Military Mail is processed and dispatched to the proper Military Installations for delivery.  Military Mail going from overseas (OCONUS) to the US (CONUS) is sorted, bagged/trayed, and labeled for dispatch by the Military Mail Terminals for transport to the Military Gateways.  Once the Military Mail has reached the gateways, processing and delivery is completed by the USPS . 1.4.	Transportation and operational conditions greatly affect the delivery times of overseas (OCONUS) Military Mail.  On average it takes 11-14 days for letter mail, and 12-18 days for parcels to be delivered overseas (OCONUS) from the US (CONUS). 1.5.	Current military addresses do not conform to USPS addressing standards, which prevents the MPS from fully utilizing USPS automation for mail processing and redirecting of mail.  USPS Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) provides guidance on the addressing of mi litary mail. MPSA manages zip codes (third line of address) for military addresses; however Major Commands (MACOMs) manage the second line of a three-line address. 1.6.	At the present time there is no centralized database containing personal address information for customers of the MPS that can be integrated into the USPS National Change of Address (NCOA) system.  MPS participation in the USPS NCOA system will provid e automated redirection of undeliverable as addressed (UAA) mail.  This will also facilitate populating the USPS Address Management System (AMS), which allows the USPS to provide the MPS with a greater depth of sort for military mail at the International S ervice Centers (ISCs). 1.7.	Contractor shall expand Military Origin Destination System (MODIS) capability to provide transit time information from the USPS gateway beyond the military post office to addressees and expand ability to capture data in a deployed, bare base environme nt.  Currently, MODIS is capable of capturing mail transit times from the USPS gateway to most servicing military post offices.   1.8.	Contractor will be familiar with MPS and USPS equipment and programming to be able to fully integrate any new systems. MPS networks include (but is not excluded to): Automated Military Postal System (AMPS) and Military Origin Destination System (MODIS ). USPS networks include (but is not excluded to): Address Management System (AMS), Blue Network, Change of Address (COA), National Change of Address (NCOA), Postal Automated Redirect System (PARS), and website (www.usps.com). 2.	Scope.  This Statement of Work is for development, testing, and deployment of a personal address database and transit time tracking system for improvements to the Military Postal System.   3.	Requirements. 3.1.	Analysis. 3.1.1.	Contractor will provide quantified cost data in response to the RFI on personnel, equipment, and any additional requirements costs. A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) is acceptable for this requirement. 3.1.2.	Contractor will schedule and coordinate an implementation meeting within seven (7) calendar days of contract award.  The contractor shall develop an agenda for the meeting and ensure that all key contractor personnel are present to discuss the requi rements and execution plan. 3.1.3.	Contractor will assist Services with the development and implementation of standardized addresses compatible with USPS addressing requirements and their Address Management System (AMS) and the Postal Automated Redirect System (PARS). 3.1.4.	Contractor will meet all U.S. Postal Service requirements and restrictions. 3.1.5.	Contractor will provide the Government with a comprehensive analysis of any space, equipment, office automation, telephone, and any miscellaneous requirements that the Government is expected to provide.   3.2.	Tracking and Quality Assurance. 3.2.1.	Contractor will provide quantified data detailing personnel, equipment, finances, and any additional requirements costs. 3.2.2.	Contractor will submit a detailed Quality Assurance Plan necessary to develop and implement the methodology or approach in support of the requirements listed in this SOW.   3.3.	Data Analysis and Data Services. 3.3.1.	Contractor will develop and test an accurate personal address database compatible with USPS address systems, in coordination with the Military Postal Service Agency (MPSA) and the United States Postal System (USPS), to improve the delivery of mail t o Service members worldwide. 3.3.2.	Contractor will provide all technical, analytical, programming, and database management expertise to develop a comprehensive accurate address database that meets USPS specifications for consolidation with their systems to facilitate the accurate and  timely delivery of mail to customers. 3.3.3.	Contractor will establish a data interchange with USPS facilities and overseas postal officials to ensure the accuracy of the address information and will ensure that USPS and all MPOs are updated on a daily or as needed basis.   3.3.4.	Contractor will develop a DoD-wide database of personal addresses for all military personnel and authorized users of the military postal system for the purposes of mail processing and to automatically forward, to the correct address, all undeliverab le as addressed mail at the USPS gateway.  Coordinate such database with USPS to ensure compliance with their National Change of Address program (NCOA). 3.3.5.	Contractor will develop a change of address (COA) system that fully integrates with the USPS National Change of Address (NCOA) system, for military members to input change of address (COA) information, personally, as the general public does through www.usps.com. 3.3.6.	Military Post Offices, located overseas, must be able to access the DoD-wide personal address database to provide mail directory services for inter-theater and CONUS origin change of address mail that will not be processed by USPS or is to be sent b ack through USPS. 3.3.7.	Contractor will develop a system to improve on the current Military Origin Destination System (MODIS).  MODIS currently is capable of capturing mail transit times from the USPS gateway to most servicing military post offices.  Contractor will expand  this capability to provide transit time information from the USPS gateway beyond the military post office to addressees and expand ability to capture data in a deployed, bare base environment. 4.	Connectivity.  Contract must resolve issues of connectivity between DoD and USPS networks for transmission of the information required. The USPS network is a Wide Area Network (WAN) using virtual private network (VPN).  The USPS network is built and mai ntained by MCI, and consists of approximately 10,000 nodes.  It is operated under a Class- A Internet license.  The topology is Ethernet TCP/IP with CISCO Routers.  There is a public and a private (intranet) side (blue network) to the USPS network.  Unlike  the military networks, attachment to the USPS network is authenticated via IP address. 5.	Contractor will provide the Government with an After Action Report (AAR) that provides lessons learned, recommended changes to procedures, and subject matter expert opinions on business practices and any recommended changes to those business practices.  Contractor will also provide to the Government all documentation of database structures, maintenance procedures and any operating manuals. 6.	DoD will own all database structures and programming upon final acceptance of work. 7.	Government Furnished Equipment/Facilities.   7.1.	Government will provide sufficient space, power, and access to common office aut omation and telephone support where available.  Government will not provide access to military IT networks or computers. 7.2.	Work will be performed at USPS facilities, military postal facilities, and the contractor facilities. 8.	RFI should include any proposed contract vehicles to perform the above work 9.	Travel. 9.1.	National travel may or may not be necessary, but is unknown at this time. 9.2.	International/Overseas travel may or may not be necessary, but is unknown at this time 10.	Period of Performance:  date of award through 31 May 2005

<DESC>The Defense Contracting Command Ã¢ÂÂ Washington (DCC-W) seeks contractors interested in reviewing the statement of objectives (SOO) for copier blanket purchase agreements (BPAs).  Those contractors who are awarded a BPA will provide all leased and purchased copiers, maintenance, and consummable supplies, in support of the entire customer base of DCC-W.  After thoroughly reading the SOO, contractors are invited to submit comments/ innovative ideas/suggestions/best industry practices/etc. to DCC-W.  T hese submissions will form the foundation for the resultant clauses, pricing schedules, terms and conditions, performance work statement (PWS), and the quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP).  Vendors/industry are strongly encouraged to be inventive, a s well as cost efficient and innovative in their recommendations. DCC-W is querying the commercial sector for the best in-practice solutions in the areas of quality assurance and schedule structure; inclusive of pricing of contract line items, payment prov isions and procedures, overall contract administration, and incentives to BPA contractors during the BPA performance period. One of the major goals of this acquisition is to craft contractor and Government friendly BPAs for the acquisition of copierS (purchased/leased), maintenance, and consummable supplies.  Extensive experience with Ã¢ÂÂexcess copy chargesÃ¢ÂÂ makes this a  feature most undesirable; and, one which will be considered only as a last resort (because it is not Government-friendly).  Flexibility of solutions for the DCC-W customer is the ultimate goal.  Contractors need not intend to participate in the BPA solicitation process to offer suggestions in any of the aforementioned areas.  Offerings from contractors may be in subject areas that are not listed; the list is not meant to be all-inclusive, but to s timulate thought in the area of a well-constructed, managed, and administered acquisition venicle.  Due diligence will be afforded to those contractors who submit technical proposals that are deemed advantageous to the Government. Contractors are permitted, even encouraged, to use teaming arrangements in order to participate in the copier BPA acquisition process.  The statement of objectives (SOO) will be available, within a week, at the following location:  http://dccw.hqda.pentago n.mil and at FedBizOpps.

<SUBJECT>A -- ETS (management and professional services, studies and analyses, engineering & technical services
<DESC>Interested Company,

	AFOTEC would appreciate if you would take some time and answer the questions below.  We are interested in your response and hope that using some of your advice we can better support our contractual requirements.  We would appreciate if you could provide your answers back to us in writing by 23 April 2004.

	HQ AFOTEC/RMC
	Attn:  Roxanna Roda
	8500 Gibson Blvd SE
	Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5558


Commerciality:

Current acquisition guidance encourages the Government to adopt the best practices of industry by purchasing commercial services.  Do you think this acquisition is commercial?  Please specifically address the following:

	a.  Are these same services provided in the commercial market?
	b.  If so how are these services provided in the commercial market?  In other words, what Government contract type most closely resembles the typical commercial contract used to purchase A&AS?  Consider major terms and conditions in your answer, but focus on the pricing methodology.
	c.  What are other major differences between our requirement and what is accepted commercial business practice?

Metrics:

AFOTEC needs to establish meaningful and measurable metrics for the services required under the ETS contract (management and professional services, studies and analyses, engineering & technical services).  Please provide industry input on how best to develop standards which measure contractor performance, or how, after contract award, to compare one contractor to another doing the same type of work.  It is already assumed the contractor meets all deliverables within budget and schedule requirements of the task order.  Provide as many inputs as feasible, but specific examples might include:

	*	Quality of studies/analyses/reports
	*	Contract/Task Order management
	*	Team management (skills, retention, training, etc.)
	*	Efficiency/Management of Government resources
	*	Cost control/cost avoidance
	*	Responsiveness to customer
	*	Time/budget projections (with milestones)

What other types of performance objectives or performance measurements do you feel are appropriate for this type of effort?  Please explain your answer.

Task orders will primarily be competed using best value to the Government.  How well your company is measured on your current task order will be a factor in whether your company is considered for future task orders.  With this in mind, are the metrics you proposed in response to the previous questions still valid?  Please explain your answer.


Incentives:

Do you feel incentives are appropriate for this type of effort?  If so, which one would be best and why?

Do you feel incentives will add measurable value to the contract?  Please explain your answer and consider the cost of administrating the incentive program into your answer.

Based on the metrics discussed above, what measurements would you use to incentivize the type of work under this contract?

Streamlining RFPs and Task Order Awards/Management

The Government desires a streamlined approach to awarding task orders that maximizes competition.  Request industry provide input and suggestions for streamlining the Task Order Management and RFP process.

What is your definition of a streamlined process for Task Order Management and RFP?  What is a reasonable amount of time to return a streamlined task order proposal?  How might a website facilitate this streamline process?

What is the impact of requiring a bid for each task order in the RFP from each contractor, in that we want maximum competition?  How would maximum competition be maintained without this requirement?

Will task order proposal costs undermine the competition we hope to gain from this contracting scheme?  Please explain your answer.  How do you recommend we mitigate this?

What types of requirements or restrictions on proposals might be useful to streamline and reduce proposal costs (e.g. page limits, oral presentations, etc.).

Do you feel that oral presentations, written proposals or a combination of both has the most benefit to the Government?



Teaming Restrictions:

A Government concern is the ability to maintain competition at the task order level.  This is a particular concern when contractors participate on more that one team.  What do you feel is the impact to competition when team members (primes or subcontractors) participate on more than one team?

If team members are allowed to participate on more than one team, how can the Government be assured that competition will be maintained?

Request industry input on how the Government should address teaming restrictions in the RFP?  Please explain your position.

Number of Contracts:

The Governments initial plan is to award up to four contracts.  Please provide your comments on this number of awards.  Would you prefer more awards or fewer awards?  Please explain your answer.  Consider competition, small business participation, and a streamlined task order award process in your answer.

Organization Conflict of Interest (OCI):

The Government anticipates OCI issues at both the contract and task order level.  Request industry input on how the Government should address this issue in the RFP and how industry plans to manage it.

Do you think it would be beneficial for you to provide a draft OCI mitigation plan at the time of the draft RFP?  The Government will review your draft OCI plan and provide feedback.  Will this facilitate your bid/no bid decision?  Please explain your position.

Cost Control:

The Government is concerned with pass-through costs for team members.  How can the Government incentivize you to be innovative in your overhead/management structure to eliminate or significantly reduce pass through costs to subcontractors, and search for ways to realize efficiencies, while still providing quality service?  Should the Government require a contract ceiling for pass-through costs or simply let the competition determine these costs?  Please explain your position.

How can the Government word its evaluation criteria and the resultant contract to achieve this goal?

Do you have a DCAA approved/audited Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) for indirect/overhead rates and/or labor rates?  Please clarify what FPRAs you have or why you do not have a FPRA.  Do all your team members/subcontractors have FPRAs?  If not, please explain why.




Clearance Requirements:

What mix of clearance do you currently maintain on your staff  Secret, TS, TS/SCI, uncleared?  (70/10/20 percent mix, for example).

Do you have or have access to a non-government owned SCIF?

In the competitive market that will service HQ AFOTEC via the ETS contract, how are you affected by requirements for Secret and SCI cleared personnel?  How do you characterize the pool of cleared/clearable people (suggested terms:  flexible, severely limited, cost prohibitive, ample, front-loaded, open, available, non-existent, manageable)?  Please clarify your answer.

How long do you anticipate it will take to fill an SCI position from the time you identify the need (task order)?

Risks:

What do you see as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate these risks.

Please provide any additional feedback you feel is relevant.

1.	CONTRACT INFORMATION:  An Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery Contract for performance-based Architectural/Engineering Support Services is required for the continued operations of the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) National Repository.  Firms submitting a proposal in response to this requirement must possess a requisite expertise in and knowledge of the mapping of real property, particularly with respect to underground infrastructure and improvements to real property, such as hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipelines, GIS, and  the engineering operations of gas and liquid companies.  
OPS has determined that based on past project history that this expertise is critical to overall successful management of the NPMS.  Therefore, OPS has determined that any potential offeror under this RFP must be licensed, registered, and certified to provide Architectural & Engineering Services. Information & Technology (IT) firms or Geographic Information Systems (GIS) firms are encouraged to submit proposals but must be either certified as an Architectural & Engineering firm or be part of a team with an A&E firm.  



The National Repository is responsible for a wide range of professional services including the compilation, research, conversion, interpretation, processing and maintenance of engineering pipeline mapping data.  The data may be submitted in either digital or hard copy formats.  Hard copy formats include USGS Quad maps and/or engineering alignment sheets that meet the requirements of the NPMS data submission standards.  Types of services required will include, but not be limited to, managing large geospatial databases within a repository; developing graphical user interfaces (GUI); processing data from various sources and combining it into a single data set; managing of the National Repository; sending check plots and check files to pipeline operators; technical writing; collecting program data;  converting, processing, and maintaining data utilizing a geographic information system (GIS); safeguarding and securing data; maintaining the NPMS homepage at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov; developing Web-based GIS applications; providing on-site GIS support; providing system integrity and security; and disseminating  pipeline data.  In addition to the above professional services, the National Repository may be asked to conduct technical studies to evaluate procedures for creating data sets to meet program regulatory needs and provide consulting services to address technical requirements over the life of the contract.  The agency expects to issue Fixed Price Task Orders for a two (2)- year base period from date of contract award, with options for eight (8) additional 12- month periods.   The total duration of the contract will not exceed ten (10) years and the cumulative total of all task orders will not exceed $10 million dollars.  The total of task orders for the base period will not be less than $10,000 (Guaranteed Minimum).  A single award is anticipated for this requirement.  If a large business firm is selected for this announcement, it must comply with the FAR Clause 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan.  The plan is not required as part of this submittal.  This announcement is open to all A&E firms regardless of size and can be downloaded via the Internet at: http://www.rspa.dot.gov under Procurement Opportunities.  Contract award is anticipated in August 2004.



2.	PROJECT INFORMATION:
The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) is a GIS database that contains the locations and selected attributes of hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipelines, breakout tanks, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities operating in onshore and offshore territories of the United States where the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) has authority to regulate pipeline facilities.  The NPMS was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), other Federal and state agencies, and the pipeline industry.  The NPMS originally consisted of pipeline and LNG facility data voluntarily submitted by pipeline operators. The Federal Pipeline Safety statute, (49 USC 60132) requires that pipeline operators submit their hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline and LNG data to the NPMS.  The data collected for the NPMS is necessary for regulatory oversight and for monitoring the security of the pipelines.

The NPMS National Repository is operated and maintained by a contractor working on behalf of OPS.  The current National Repository began operation in 1998. The current contractor has assisted in finalizing the first NPMS Operator Standards in March 1999; developing procedures for collecting, editing, and processing pipeline and LNG geospatial data; developing quality control procedures; advising OPS on technical issues; studying the methodology for creating data sets for unusually sensitive environmental areas; developing and maintaining the NPMS homepage at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov; developing Web-based GIS applications; providing system integrity and security; providing on-site GIS support in OPS; updating the NPMS Operator Standards in January 2003; and updating the NPMS Repository Standards in March 2003.  The latest standards are available from the NPMS website at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov.

The NPMS originally consisted of a single National Repository and multiple state repositories.  In September 2002, OPS ended the state repository program in favor of using a single National Repository for the processing and storage of the NPMS geospatial data.  The National Repository will be responsible for processing and maintaining approximately 500,000 miles of pipeline data, LNG facilities, and breakout tanks.  Pipeline operators are required to update submissions to the NPMS as changes occur along their pipeline system.

A variety of users in the research, planning, and repair of real property use NPMS data.  The pipeline industry and Public Safety Officials utilize the NPMS data in conjunction with integrity management data to identify pipeline sections that may require repair and to locate pipelines near areas of new development. Other Federal agencies may use NPMS data to identify the locations of existing pipeline corridors for future pipeline new construction.  The NPMS may also be used by industry, state and local officials as a tool in the planning process associated with real property, including planning associated with property development, zoning, and construction activities. Currently, the NPMS has 297,000 miles of real property natural gas transmission pipelines and 160,000 miles of hazardous liquid transmission pipelines.


SELECTION CRITERIA:  See FedBizOps numbered Note 24 for a general description of the selection process. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, three or more firms considered to be most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation.  Those selected firms for negotiation will have demonstrated the competence and qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required.

1.  Background:

    a.  Requiring Organization:  The organization requiring the services outlined in the SOW is:

Navy Supply Information Systems Activity
Code 9322
5450 Carlisle Pike
P.O. Box 2010
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0787

b.	Background. 

As part of the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Convergence Program, the Navy has selected SAPs Warehouse Management System (WMS) to manage their warehouse operations.   The Navy desires that this single ERP system have processes consistent with the objective of normalizing the four ERP Pilots (NEMAIS, SMART, SIGMA and CABRILLO), which is to converge logistics business processes for the entire Navy.  The role of the converged WMS will be to normalize the Navys warehousing business processes on a global basis.   The Navy ERP system will be rolled out to select sites within a couple of years.

NAVSUP would like to implement Decentralized Warehouse Management System at our NAVSUP partner sites at least a year in advance of when Global Template (GT) 2.0 (which includes the functionality required to run at a Partner Site) is rolled out, allowing the early shutdown of the applications supporting warehouse management, saving the Navy millions in information technology (IT) costs to host and maintain.  Additionally, it is anticipated that the business process improvements resulting from implementing SAPs best practice warehouse management will save the Navy a substantial amount as well.

Today, the 40 Navy Partner sites perform their warehouse management functions for the Navy owned material using several UADPS subsystems/applications (running on both IBM Mainframe and Tandem). These systems collectively communicate warehouse information to and from the IM system.  Since these sites are not currently part of the initial rollout of Converged ERP, the Navy would like to replace the legacy warehouse management applications (residing on Tandem) with DWMS. The SAP DWMS module will initially interface with our legacy systems, which will continue to perform the Inventory Management (IM) function.  Eventually, the SAP DWMS will interface with the main SAP for the performance of the IM function.  Having this piece of the ERP solution already in place prior to the completion of the total converged Navy ERP solution will facilitate and mitigate the risk of implementing the final Navy solution.

Implementing DWMS before ERP Convergence will enable a highly visible early ERP success while facilitating and mitigating the risk of the Navy ERP final solution. Additionally, early implementation of SAP DWMS will allow NAVSUP retail partner sites to shut down those U2 applications supporting warehouse management, provide an enhanced and more efficient capability, and provide a significant return on investment (ROI).  Additionally, it enables us to move forward by complying with the DOD Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) functionality mandate.

Early implementation of SAP DWMS will offer Navy the opportunity to implement efficiency-enhancing technologies and processes in its warehouses, just as the converged ERP implementation will offer the opportunity to implement them for the logistics community as a whole.  One of the biggest advantages to implementing DWMS in advance of the ERP Converged system is that it enables the Navy logistics IT community to implement incrementally versus using a big bang approach.

Additionally, it is anticipated that implementing SAP DWMS at the NAVSUP partner sites will significantly compress the schedule for implementing the converged centralized ERP by pre-converting the 40 sites.  It is also anticipated that once DWMS is installed at all partner sites, groups of National Stock Numbers (NSNs) can be moved globally versus site by site. 

2.  Scope of Work to be Performed:  This SOW solicits contractor support to assist in the development of a cost and schedule estimate to implement DWMS at the 40 Navy Partner Sites. This will be a Fixed Price Labor Hours delivery order and will cover requirements identified to support the efforts.  The tasks within the scope of this requirement are as follows:

·	Review DWMS capabilities against the functional requirements of NAVSUP warehouses
·	Review the Gap Analysis (prepared previously) and identify any changes as a result of SAP software enhancements 
·	Identify estimated hardware/infrastructure requirements
·	Develop high-level timeline and cost estimate for DWMS implementation

Although the deliverable for this SOW is to provide an estimate, it should be noted that the contractor should be aware of the following requirements when putting together the estimate:

a.	Integrator tasks are to be performed using the Global ASAP Methodology. 
b.	Integrator is to assist NAVISA Project Officer in the development of project planning and strategy to include development of project plans, program standards and release strategy.
c.	Estimate is to address the cost and timeline to implement DWMS at an initial Navy Partner site, and address costs to implement at the other sites.
d.	Contractor shall assist in the development of an Implementation Plan detailing the high level tasks required to design, build, test and implement DWMS.
e.	The contractor will be required to submit bi-weekly status reports, participate in conference calls, attend IPRs, and other meetings, as required.
f.	DWMS is to be worked in close conjunction with the Navy ERP project and close integration of business processes and sharing of data and resources are required. 
g.	The contractor shall be responsible for leading the definition and design of WM related interfaces, conversions and extensions and forms and while providing oversight and mentoring to Government personnel.
h.	The contractor shall provide technical expertise and assume a lead role in the development and use of webMethods.
i.	The contractor shall work with Government personnel to identify the warehouse requirements that can be supported through the use of AIT and design, build and test the AIT technologies and associated interfaces, enhancements and modifications.   
j.	The contractor shall be required to perform a site survey at the Pilot site to perform an analysis of current business practices.
k.	The contractor shall support the Navy in the development of training materials.

It should be noted that the decentralized Warehouse Management Team will be comprised of both Government and contractor personnel.  It is envisioned that there will be Co-Leads in all phases of the project.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Biological Control of Noxious Weeds at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming 

Objectives.   The project has two objectives.

1.  To initiate new and enhance existing efforts to control noxious weeds at F. E. Warren Air Force Base (WAFB) through the release and monitoring of plant-feeding insects targeted at selected noxious weeds.

2.  To incorporate biological control of weeds into existing weed control programs, with the primary thrust of enhancing weed control in environmentally sensitive areas which support Colorado butterfly plant, Gaura neomexicana coloradoensis, or Prebles Meadow Jumping Mouse, Zapus hudsonius preblei (Preble), both of which are threatened species.

Rationale. The proposed project addresses three needs.  First, the project addresses the need to attack noxious weeds on an ecosystem level.  Biological control of noxious weeds at WAFB will benefit neighbors bordering the installation by curtailing the spread of noxious weeds off property, and indirectly provide a source for biocontrol agents that will attack noxious weeds on land in close proximity to WAFB.  Second, it will address the need to integrate control methods for noxious weeds.  By bringing biocontrol agents into this ecosystem an additional control measure will be added to existing programs.  Adding natural enemies of weeds to the ecosystems should disrupt weed growth and may act synergistically with other control measures.  Finally, establishing weed herbivores should reduce the need to use chemical and mechanical control measures by adding a long-term weed management component, especially in environmentally sensitive sites that contain threatened plant and animal species.

Methodology.  The key to any successful weed control program, regardless of the control measures employed, is based on a thorough understanding of the extent of the weed infestation at a site.   Therefore the first goal is to initiate a survey of the noxious weeds at WAFB using obvious and problem areas (OPAs) known to exist at the site. As an example of a problem area, there are leafy spurge, Euphorbia esula, and Dalmatian toadflax, Linaria genistifolia dalmatica, infestations at WAFB that may impact populations of the Colorado butterfly plant, Gaura neomexicana coloradoensis, a Federally-listed threatened species, which is typically found in wetland, sub-irrigated habitat. In addition, the Prebles meadow jumping mouse, Zapus hudsonius preblei (Preble), another threatened species is found at WAFB. Wetlands and areas that harbor threatened species cannot be treated with herbicides to control noxious weeds, nor can mechanical control (such as mowing) be used successfully.  Therefore infestations of noxious weeds are difficult to control.

Biological control of these noxious weed infestations would preserve native habitat, avoid damage to threatened species and their habitats, and preclude the use of herbicides, which may impact wetland plants and animals directly (toxicity) and indirectly (removal of desirable plant species) even if threatened species were not a concern.

Therefore, during the summer of 2004, this project will identify known noxious weed and Colorado butterfly plant sites and conduct GPS mapping to develop detailed maps of the extent of the weed infestations and where these infestations may impact Colorado butterfly plant.  In addition, the project will collect plant density and plant height data at each of these sites prior to, or at the time biocontrol agents are released.  This initial mapping and plant data collection is critical in that it establishes a baseline for economic and ecological evaluations in future phases of the program.
 
At WAFB, there are other sites infested with noxious weeds, such as Canada and musk thistle, and spotted knapweed that would benefit from a biological control program.  The project will implement and establish a program using experience and results at Ft. Carson, Air Force Academy, Monument Fire Center (Monument, CO), and Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (near Golden, CO) with these noxious weeds.  Table 1 contains a list of the insects that will be released at WAFB in 2004.

The program has experience in establishing biological control programs for all the noxious weeds at WAFB, and has nationwide contacts, in addition to existing establishments of the necessary insects at Colorado sites.

In any biological control program, there is a three-phase approach to ensure a sound program that achieves the desired reduction in the pest species targeted for control: 

·  Phase One consists of collection and release of biocontrol agents and sampling for establishment.

·  Phase Two takes biocontrol agents that are established in Phase One, and redistributes them into areas where they are not yet established in order to engender high populations of the agents.

·  Phase Three consists of an ecological and economic analysis of the program in terms of how the biocontrol program impacted the pest and the benefits accruing to their establishment in light of standard control practices.  In general, each phase covers three years.

The three phases of a biological control program are not necessarily distinct from each other, but can coincide, depending on the status of a specific biocontrol agent, the number of pests under consideration and the number of biocontrol agents being used in the program.  In the Ft. Carson program, they are currently in Phase Two for field bindweed, musk thistle and spotted knapweed, with biocontrol agents being released and monitored for establishment.  The program is also beginning Phase Three work on spotted knapweed, with remediation efforts and detailed plant reduction measurement that began in the summer of 2001.  Canada thistle is still in Phase One at Ft. Carson, primarily because of the difficulty in establishing insects that have a significant impact on this weed.  However, the program is flexible and will be able to incorporate new insect or mite species as they are made available for release in the United States.

At the Air Force Academy, the fourth year of the program was completed in 2003.  Therefore that effort is in Phase Two.  Biocontrol agent establishment is confirmed on Canada thistle, knapweed, musk thistle, and leafy spurge insects, and redistribution is underway.

Releases of biocontrol agents at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site began in the summer of 2001.  Some aspects are in Phase One, and others in Phase Two, namely field bindweed and Dalmatian toadflax.

An effort at WAFB fits in very well with existing projects in Colorado.  Beginning in the spring/summer of 2004 a release program consisting of redistribution of insects established at Ft. Carson, Air Force Academy, and possibly Rocky Flats can begin.  In actuality, this would be part of the spotted knapweed Phase Two effort at Ft. Carson. They would also begin a Phase One program on toadflax at F. E. Warren AFB with the toadflax moth, Calophasia lunula, which is available from the Colorado Department of Agriculture.  The toadflax stem boring weevil, Mecinus janthinus, is another candidate species that should be available for the first time in the summer of 2003.   Leafy spurge insects, with which there has been great success at the Air Force Academy sites, consist of Aphthona sp. flea beetles.  Redistributions of Aphthona sp. beetles from Air Force Academy sites and other sites in Colorado to which there is access, to WAFB will begin as soon as the beetles emerge in the summer of 2004.
 
At WAFB there are infestations of hounds tongue and purple loosestrife.  These noxious weeds are new to the program, however biocontrol agents do exist for both plants, and the program will secure and release agents in 2004 at the appropriate time.  The candidate species are listed in Table 1.

Concurrently with the release of the biocontrol agents, the program will collect plant data to set baselines for each OPA where releases are made.  The program will measure plant density along transects through the infestations, measuring the density of plants per meter at 10-meter intervals, and plant height at these same intervals.  This sampling scheme has worked well in the past at Colorado sites.

The program acknowledges that threatened plant surveys must be taken with great care, and they are familiar with previous and ongoing research at WAFB with regard to Colorado butterfly plant (Munk and Hild 2000, Brown and Tuthill 2001).  All surveys will be made with regard to the preservation of Colorado butterfly plants and their habitat, and the program will ensure the efforts do not interfere with other projects.

The program also acknowledges that native thistles are present at WAFB.  Native thistle species know to occur in Laramie County include prairie thistle, Cirsium canescens, and Flodmans thistle, C. flodmanii.  Other species that may occur in Laramie County include fewleaf thistle, C. remotifolium, Wyoming thistle, C. pulcherrimum, and yellowspine thistle, C. ochrocentrum.  During the course of the project, the program will identify and record the occurrence and densities of native thistles.  The program will also record the impact of any biocontrol agents on these species.  Impact is expected to be minimal because of phenological asynchrony between native and noxious thistles at the time when the plants are attacked by the biocontrol agents.  However, the program realizes some insects may attack a native thistle species, and therefore they are at present conducting a risk assessment of noxious thistle biocontrol at WAFB.  This assessment will be restricted to the thistle species since knapweed, leafy spurge, toadflax, and other weed species encountered will not have associated native species that are closely related.  The risk assessment will focus on biological control of noxious thistle species in terms of the potential damage noxious species may do to native species, the impact of herbicide and mechanical control of noxious thistle species on native species, and the environmental and economic cost of doing nothing to control noxious thistle species.

With regard to the assessment of biocontrol agent establishment, the program will survey the OPAs in the fall of 2004 for establishment where possible.  The insects and the target weed species have differing phenologies, and specific data collection times will vary.  For example, the program can determine successful establishment of Urophora sp. flies on Canada thistle in the fall by examining seed heads (U. affinis) and stems (U. cardui) for galls and pupal overwintering chambers.  However, Aphthona sp. beetle establishment on leafy spurge, or Calophasia lunula establishment on toadflax, will not be known until the spring and summer of 2005.

Biological control of noxious weeds is an important aspect of overall noxious weed control programs.  In many instances, however, biological control is misunderstood.  It is oftentimes considered a novelty or is placed lower on the list of control measures because it is a slower control measure than herbicides.  There is a great need for education in the intricacies of biological control of noxious weeds.  By including student workers in this program from the start, new personnel from various backgrounds will be trained about biological control of weeds.  The methodologies for this objective are rather straightforward.  Student workers will be included in all aspects of the program.  Student workers will be trained to recognize the noxious weeds and other plants, including Colorado butterfly plant.  These student workers will be present when releases are made, and they will take plant density and height samples from the OPAs.  Over time, these personnel will assist in sampling for establishment of insects at the OPAs.

Evaluation.  The success of the project begins with establishment of the insects on the target weeds.  From this point, success will be based on evaluations taken at various times over the course of the program. The program can be evaluated both short and long term.  The surveys of OPAs and plant parameters within the OPAs will serve as the baseline for evaluations in the future.  As the insects become established, increase, and begin to damage or kill plants within an infestation, the program will be able to track their progress.  Progress assessments will include: 1. reduction in the overall size of the weed infestation; 2. decrease in plant density, height, and other parameters such as numbers of seedheads per plant; and 3. increase the insects per unit area (which will vary depending on the insect and weed species).  In addition, as weed infestations decline, it will be important in the long term to evaluate the cost (economic and ecological) associated with this program, the use of herbicides alone, and the cost if nothing had been done to reduce or eliminate these weed infestations. Of particular importance to WAFB will be an evaluation of the status of Colorado butterfly plant in declining or noxious weed infestations.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
RFP number H92222-04-R-0029
regarding Global Broadcast Operations Technical Program Management Support.  
 1. QUESTION:  It is my assumption from the posting that this bid represents a search for a contractor who will work to place programming from JPSE/USSOCOM on current shortwave outlets available around the world.  Is this assumption correct?
ANSWER: No.  We are looking for a contractor who has global reach capability via shortwave broadcast.  Using a placement capability would probably not meet mission needs and requirements. It is however understood that the contractor may be required to use partnered companies or sub contract work to fulfill this requirement.
  
2. QUESTION:  It is also my assumption that this contractor will supply the equipment/expertise necessary to ensure the successful, secure distribution of said programming to the various shortwave outlets.  Is this assumption correct?
ANSWER: Yes.  The JPSE will provide final products to the contractor who will be responsible for distribution and dissemination to regional, trans regional and/or global audiences.

3. QUESTION:  It is my assumption that the programming is pre-produced by JPSE/USSOCOM, not by the contractor.  Is this assumption correct?
ANSWER: Yes.  Vendor will be provided with final products for broadcast.

4. QUESTION:  With the cost of shortwave time available in such a wide window, based on a whole host of factors, are you looking for an AVERAGE price for the Hourly Broadcast Time, or one fixed rate to which we will bid?  With your range of 1200 to 28,800 hours, there could be a SIGNIFICANT difference in pricing.
ANSWER: We are looking for a fixed rate price.

5. QUESTION:  I assume that the word 'vendor' is used to suggest the actual shortwave outlet.  Is this assumption correct?
ANSWER: No. Vendor is used to describe the party responsible for movement of final products to include distribution and dissemination.

6. QUESTION:  Is it the intention of the JPSE/USSOCOM to provide a 24-hr a day broadcast network via shortwave, thus the search for the contractor?  Or are we only looking at specialty programming?
ANSWER: The JPSE is looking for a 24-hour capability.  While actual times will vary by market and audience analysis, most programming will occur for 18-24 hours per day. 

7. QUESTION:  What region(s) of the world do you plan to target? That will be a determining factor in building a bid, as securing access to the most reasonably priced but most effective transmitters vary from region to region around the world.
ANSWER: As stated in the proposal the JPSE has a Global dissemination requirement. The actual locations will change based on world events and reqirements. 

8. QUESTION:  Will the contractor be required/requested to operate from MacDill AFB?
ANSWER: No. However, the contractor may be required to attend an award briefing at MacDill AFB, and program briefings at locations to be determined.

9. QUESTION:  What will be the level of interaction between the contractor and military liaisons?  
ANSWER: The contractor will be required to meet with the military as required. Level is unknown at this time.  The intent is to limit the contacts.  All official contact will be coordinated through the JPSE in coordination with the contractor.

10. QUESTION:  Is this a Support/Services contract only or is there equipment/system upgrades involved?

    ANSWER:  This is a Support Services contract.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 5 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STARDUST CLEANROOM - RFO# NNJ04060551Q: Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to the combined synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to address the following questions and associated answers. Questions and answers regarding the RFO# NNJ04060551Q are also posted on the Stardust Cleanroom Acquisition Website and can be located by accessing	     http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/scr/default.asp 	 Questions and answers are numbered sequentially and are in congruence with the "Questions and Answers" posted on NAIS and the Stardust Cleanroom Acquistion Website.  QUESTION 12: The website lists the Statement of Work, Drawings, Cleanroom Classification Standards, and other items, but it does not list anything identified as "specifications".	However, the drawings continually instructs us to "see specifications."	Can you tell us how to get the specifications or indicate which document the drawings refer to? ANSWER TO QUESTION 12: The "specifications" are the Construction Contractor's specifications.  The drawings were provided as a reference to the cleanroom vendors so that they could see the details of the outer room construction (these are mainly needed to understand how the cleanroom will tie into the facility).  These drawings provide a fair amount of detail -- but more detail is listed in the specifications.  Specific things like the outer room paint color, flooring part number, etc.  These details should not be necessary for the cleanroom vendor. The requirements for the cleanroom vendor are listed in the Stardust Cleanroom statement of work (SOW).  QUESTION 13: The RFO says, "A complete list and samples of all materials (i.e., windows, window gaskets, sealants, flooring, etc.) shall be submitted to NASA with proposal package." Does NASA want the cleanroom vendor to deliver sample windows, doors, doorknobs, walls, HVAC unit, ductwork, etc. or is NASA just looking for samples of certain more specific items?	Would cut sheets from the various items suffice?  If so, which items could be done with cut sheets and which with actual samples? ANSWER TO QUESTION 13: Small pieces from cut sheets will suffice.  NASA wants an idea on the wall material, window material, and any soft goods (gaskets, sealants). REMINDER TO ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: All contractual and technical questions MUST be in writing (e-mail or fax) to Seena K. Mathews, Contract Specialist, email address: seena.k.mathews@nasa.gov ; fax number: 281-483-4066, OR Kelly R. Wilcutt, Contracting Officer, email address: kelly.r.wilcutt@nasa.gov ; fax number: 281-483-4173, not later than May 12, 2004. Telephone questions will not be accepted. Please do not call or write(email or fax) the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. This reminder is issued in order to protect the integrity of the procurement process. Thank you.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 15, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet. These documents reside on a World Wide Web(WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
