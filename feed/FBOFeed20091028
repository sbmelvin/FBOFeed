Point of Contact: Kenneth W. Hitchens, (609) 485-6125
Description of Requirement: Global Positioning is susceptible to interference and the Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA) is responsible to detect and mitigate this interference in order to protect air navigation systems.  
The FAA in an attempt to improve its research capability in this area, the agency plans to study the potential of a demonstration system, which will be expandable into an operational, nationwide capability, to detect and locate sources of interference.  This demonstration method utilizes the data from GPS receivers located at cellular communications tower around the country.
 The main objective is for support in a developmental study to determine the feasibility of the limited demonstration systems and its potential for expansion into a nationwide or global system.
Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The FAA, William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single contract to Alcatel-Lucent., Murray Hill, New Jersey.

Also Alcatel-Lucnet has extensive experience in using GPS to detect an locate interference.
Alcatel-Lucent has the necessary network access, design documentation, system knowledge, and experience to make the required modifications to their switching equipment to provide the required data without affecting subscribers.
Consequently, Alcatel-Lucent has 47% of the worldwide market, as of 4Q2007, in Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO) communication equipment, which is the current standard for third generation (3G) wireless systems.
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.

This BAA provides development funding opportunities with the hope that some decorporating agents may progress sufficiently to allow BARDA the opportunity to acquire such products as medical countermeasures once approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat specific medical conditions resulting from internal contamination with radionuclides. It is therefore anticipated that research and development studies awarded from this BAA will advance therapeutic products toward eventual approval from the FDA for treatment of internal radionuclide contamination.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit proposals that request funding to advance the development of lead candidate products that directly address the elimination of a range of radionuclides and physicochemical forms of radionuclides that are relevant to accidental or nonaccidental radioactive contamination and exposure. The goals are to advance the development of novel decorporation agents, conduct translational research and development, and provide additional information and data toward FDA licensure. Because of the needs resulting from a mass casualty situation, the lead candidates that will be supported must be suitable for a mass casualty situation (e.g., orally available) and be able to decorporate radionuclides of interest, such as, but not limited to (listed by increasing atomic number, not priority), Co, Sr, Cs, Ce, Ir, Po, U, Pu, Am, and Cm in physicochemical forms that would be encountered in an actual exposure, and administered by inhalation, ingestion, or transdermal absorption through wounds.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that organizations selected under this BAA will have identified a promising product and already have preliminary data on a lead candidate that will decorporate one or more of the radionuclides of interest (e.g., Co, Sr, Cs, Ce, Ir, Po, U, Pu, Am, and Cm) and that is suitable for a mass casualty situation. Offerors shall propose a Product Profile and a Product Development Work Plan that will incorporate non-clinical research and development including IND or NDA enabling studies as well as manufacturing of the proposed decorporation agent. Pursuant to the need for manufacturing of the product, the Offeror is expected to be capable of manufacturing the product under cGMP conditions or work with a partner that can manufacture the product under cGMP conditions.</p>
<p>The Offeror must have a facility or arranged to have access to a facility that is licensed by Federal, State and/or local agencies for in vivo radionuclide experiments.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that two cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year period of performance beginning on or about 6/30/10 utilizing special contracting methods, FAR Subpart 17.1-Multi-year Contracting. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 3.0 FTEs/year.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about 9/08/09, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

Note: The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOTaccepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award a SoleSource, Firm Fixed Price contract to Barber-Nichols, Inc., 6325 West 55thAvenue, Arvada, CO 80002 for the following items: 2 each Air Turbine Assemblies,with an option to purchase 1 each additional Air Turbine Assembly, 6 each ClutchKits, with an option to buy 8 each additional clutch Kits, and one lot of SpareSub-Components, with an option to buy one lot of Stator/Rotor Tie Rod bolts. Barber-Nichols is currently producing Air Turbine Assemblies for the Mk 21 ATPwhich have been proven to meet all the technical requirements. The Navy hasinvested considerable time and money into the design, development, testing andproduction of this component. Duplicating this effort for development of anothersource would cost the Navy in the millions which would not be recouped throughcompetition. In fact, these non-recoverable costs significantly exceed the totalestimated cost of the spare Air Turbine Assembly contract. Further, a newsupplier would require additional time between contract award and delivery ofthe spare units to account for the efforts described above, therebysignificantly impacting the mission readiness of the SEAWOLF and VIRGINIA Classsubmarine force. Required delivery is as follows: 2 each Air Turbine Assemblies, 1st at 92 weeksARO, and the 2nd at 16 weeks from 1st delivery; 1 each (opt 1) Air TurbineAssembly, 92 weeks after option exercise;6 each Clutch kits, 40 weeks ARO; 8each (opt 2) Clutch kits, 40 weeks ARO; 1 lot of Spare Sub-components, 56 weeksARO for bearings, 40 weeks ARO for tie rods, and 30 weeks ARO for the remainder;and 1 lot (opt 3) for additional tie rods, 30 weeks ARO after option exercise.F.O.B.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

<DESC><br />NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought announcement only. Solicitations are not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. <br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification as well as to provide a preliminary concept of operations for industry comment. Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate Federal Agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510. AFRH provides residents with daily living needs, to include medical services, at campuses in Washington, DC, and Gulfport, MS. The Gulfport campus (AFRH-G) is scheduled to reopen in October 2010 following reconstruction of facilities severely damaged by hurricane Katrina. This modern retirement community will offer residential living, assisted living, memory support, and long-term care to our nation's veterans. The on-campus Community Wellness Center will encompass a Wellness Center, a Dental Clinic and will offer convenient access to expert health care. The Wellness Center will provide primary and specialty medical services in consultation with neighboring hospitals. The following services will be offered: geriatric medicine, gastroenterology, dermatology, geriatric optometry and audiology, psychiatry, orthopedics, urology, pain management, internal medicine, social service, nutrition counseling, podiatry, laboratory services, dental services, rehabilitation services and radiology services. There is a satellite pharmacy onsite along with a well-equipped rehabilitative service department. AFRH Gulfport anticipates that contractor (Service Provider) support will be required to provide all primary care (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services), specialized care, and related medical and social support services as part of the new campus Wellness Center. AFRH-G residents will number approximately 600 when the facility is fully operational. The Service Provider will be required to schedule and provide transportation to off-campus medical service providers for specialty care not provided at the Wellness Clinic. The Service Provider will maintain all resident medical records using a Government-supplied information management system. The Service Provider will prepare and submit billing for all services performed to the appropriate resident insurance providers (e.g. Medicare Parts A, B and D; TRICARE; Blue Cross, or Other Health Insurance (OHI) provider). The Government does not intend to offer a fee-for service or capitation payment contract, but anticipates that the insurance reimbursements received by the Service Provider will constitute payment. There may be exceptions to this approach that result in the Government covering some additional costs. The Government intends to provide a near- turnkey facility that will include office and treatment room furnishings, rehabilitation facilities and equipment, medical equipment, utilities, facility maintenance, communications and information technology equipment and services. The Service Provider will procure all required medical supplies for the Wellness Center. Some specialty equipment, such as radiology equipment will be provided by the Service Provider, either on-site or via transportation to nearby (Service Provider subcontractor) facilities. The intended contract period will be for a base year and four option years. Services must be available as residents return to the AFRH-G campus starting in October 2010. The Government intends to post a consolidated response to vendor questions via FedBizOpps at a later date. AFRH-G also anticipates that an Industry Day event will be scheduled in the January 2010 time frame so that interested vendors can meet one-on-one with AFRH officials. All future information about this possible acquisition including solicitations and amendments will be distributed solely through FedBizOpps. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most current information. <br /><br />If your firm has interest in this opportunity, and you are capable of providing the required services, please provide the requested information below. <br />&bull; Company name, address, point of contact, web site link, business size<br />&bull; Company capabilities statement and recent past performance on similar-size contracts, to include references<br />&bull; If your firm is certified in one of the following small business programs, please indicate this in your response. <br />o 8(a) Program, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned Small Business, HUB Zone <br />&bull; Provide any questions and/or comments regarding the AFRH-G requirements in a separate MS-Word file<br />&bull; Responders must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Registration can be made at http://www.ccr.gov<br />&bull; Please provide your response by 5 PM, November 20, 2009. Email responses are preferred.

<DESC>1.1 Purpose/Scope<br />The purpose of this SOW is to obtain hardware and engineering services in support of the Air National Guard (ANG) Block 30 F-16 Advanced Identity Friend/Foe (AIFF) program. This effort supports current and future installation phases of the program, which will allow for installation of 100+ systems on ANG aircraft.
<p><br />1.2 Background<br />The ANG has selected the AN/APX-113-56 Combined Interrogator/Transponder (CIT) AIFF system for their fleet of Block 25/30/32 C-model F-16 aircraft. To date, 81 ANG aircraft have been modified with the -56 AIFF system. Current funding will allow for fielding of approximately 100 additional systems, with expected future funding for additional installations within the next three years.</p>
<p>AIFF is a critical system for the ANG ASA mission of national security, reducing fratricide and pilot workload while increasing pilot situational awareness. The ANG AIFF program has been funded with a combination of Defense Emergency Response Funds (DERF), Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Congressional Plus-up sources of funding.<br />AIFF was initially fielded with Software Capabilities Update (SCU) 6 in November 2007. Group A and B Hardware kits are fully qualified and have been flying on ANG F-16 aircraft.<br /><br />This acquisition has been approved as a sole source award to BAE Systems (Cage Code:&nbsp;80249).</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI):<br />MILSATCOM Commercial Acquisition Options</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Description</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Center (SMC) seeks to determine commercial acquisition options for satisfying future Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) needs.</p>
<p>SMC is interested in determining the extent to which emerging commercial capabilities can be leveraged for the acquisition of MILSATCOM capabilities either through the hosting of payloads or tailored procurement of Commercial SATCOM systems. SMC is also interested in suggested changes to acquisition and business approaches (e.g. specifications, contracting, policy, legal, ITU).</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries (technical, contractual, administrative), questions, or clarifications of any kind must be submitted via email to the (POC) listed below. Regarding this RFI, direct contact or one-on-one meetings with a contracting officer, program manager, or technical parties, is not allowed, apart from the Government Exchange Meetings described later in the RFI.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />This RFI supports the following specific objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Gathering information on current and future Commercial SATCOM systems and business models that may be tailorable and affordable to meet DoD SATCOM needs. The spectrum of current business models under consideration includes. <br />&bull; (1) FAR Part 12 Modified Commercial Payload (firm fixed price) acquisition to meet DoD requirements for hosting on a commercial satellite<br />&bull; (2) Military payload acquisition for hosting on a commercial satellite (Government Furnished Equipment)<br />&bull; (3) DoD payload functions designed into commercial satellite (DoD payload drives satellite design) <br />&bull; (4) Purchase tailored Commercial Satellite (FAR Part 12) <br />&bull; (5) DoD funding technology/capability development/maturation of desired capabilities/interfaces that could be integrated into commercial satellites (Payloads or Bus) <br />&bull; Gathering information on current and future Commercial SATCOM technical capabilities that could be tailored to provide dedicated DoD payload capabilities for separate hosting<br />&bull; Gathering information on acquisition constraints associated with application of military requirements <br />&bull; Gathering holistic business case information (approach, schedule, life cycle cost, risk) relevant to DoD commercial SATCOM acquisitions including terminal, teleport, network and ground interfaces, to support comparative analyses to inform go forward planning<br />&bull; Gathering information on the compatibility/sensitivity of commercial solutions to meet traditional military requirements and accommodating the constraints of tactical-edge joint-terminals (e.g. Army/Ground, Navy, Airborne), teleports, networked systems, host platforms (AISR, Ships, Ground Vehicles) and related operations concepts<br />&bull; Enabling definition of potential follow-system PRDAs to define new business/architectural approaches exploiting commercial SATCOM</p>
<p>Not under consideration for this RFI are commercial bandwidth DISA/GSA type service lease models nor related brokered leased business arrangements. Responses to one or more parts of this RFI will be accepted as well responses to this general area of interest to help inform a Gov't Commercial SATCOM go forward path. The commercial concepts and desired military SATCOM features under consideration are shown in appropriate sections below</p>
<p><strong>Topics for Responses</strong><br />Briefly and clearly describe your views on a DoD commercial SATCOM acquisition focused on the following levels:</p>
<p>(1) Acquisition of a modified commercial payload for hosting; <br />(2) Capability for hosting a DoD-furnished payload<br />(3) Acquisition of a modified full end-to-end Commercial SATCOM System (satellite, ground, teleports, other). <br />(4) General business contexts</p>
<p>To clarify context, suggested questions are included below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Acquisition of a Modified Commercial Payload for Separate Hosting</span></p>
<p>The concept for this topic is that DoD would purchase a modified (FAR Part 12) commercial payload for a separate hosting on a commercial satellite. This topic addresses only the modification of a commercial payload to meet DOD needs, using a firm fixed price contract vehicle. It is important that the resulting modified commercial payload is interoperable and compatible with DoD user terminals, ground infrastructure, and wideband/other MILSATCOM systems.</p>
<p>&bull; What are modified commercial concepts that could support a dedicated DoD payload?</p>
<p>&bull; To what extent could a base commercial payload be tailored to meet DoD needs or desired features?</p>
<p>&bull; Address any impacts to existing DoD ground and user terminal infrastructure that may be required to accommodate a modified commercial payload solution</p>
<p>&bull; What are example schedule timelines and costs for developing a modified commercial payload for DoD use?</p>
<p>&bull; Does the respondent have technologies that could be incorporated on a tailored commercial payload that would require an additional investment by DoD?</p>
<p>&bull; Please consider the following list of Military SATCOM features:</p>
<p>&bull; Military frequency use/reuse, multiplexing to avoid commercial frequency contention<br />&bull; Compatibility with fleet-wide legacy terminals (to preserve large investment) without specialized upgrades or control software<br />&bull; Airborne (aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) wideband SATCOM terminal constraints with small antenna<br />&bull; Communications to small mobile terminals (weather, blockage)<br />&bull; Beam handovers for moving terminals (continuity of service)<br />&bull; Anti-jamming/interference/geolocation <br />&bull; Modem and antenna technologies <br />&bull; Adaptable coverage areas to optimize in-theater capacities for a typical areas of operations (AOR)<br />&bull; Dynamic provisioning techniques<br />&bull; High data rate &amp; throughput<br />&bull; Adaptive weather change accommodation<br />&bull; Ground and gateway/teleport control <br />&bull; Support of military multi-level precedence and pre-emption (MLPP)<br />&bull; Differential treatment of traffic flows via Quality of Service (QoS) provisions<br />&bull; Dynamic provisioning of capacity via QoS<br />&bull; Load balancing across a transponder and terminal via power control schemes<br />&bull; Information Assurance/Security<br />&bull; Space situational awareness and Space Protection<br />&bull; Military control of payload and teleport functions including access control, security, information assurance, network operations (Internet Packet and Telemetry, Tracking and Control)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Capabilities for Hosting a DOD-furnished Payload (Government Furnished Equipment)</span></p>
<p>The concept for this topic is that DoD would procure a military communications payload and then provide this payload to a commercial operator for rapid capability insertion into a commercial satellite to meet theater-specific surge requirements. Please consider the following questions related to this topic:</p>
<p>&bull; The above (Question 1) list of desired Military SATCOM features should be considered in responding to this RFI topic:</p>
<p>&bull; What degree of influence would DoD be able to assert over the host satellite operations (e.g., orbital placement, military control of sensitive payload items, control of related sensitive operations such as anomaly reporting and bus management, control of bandwidth prioritization/pre-emption).</p>
<p>&bull; Is there a level of standardized hosted payload interfaces that could be built into each satellite manufactured in a fleet to enable quick reaction payload insertion?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the key decision points in a commercial development schedule for DoD participation with a hosted payload approach?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the possible physical attributes (e.g. SWAP) of hosted communication payloads that could be accommodated on a commercial satellite? What are the constraint, issues, and business arrangements that may be required for different physical attributes of hosted payload?</p>
<p>&bull; At what point is a hosted payload no longer a viable appliqu&eacute; (e.g., payload drives overall satellite design)? What are the considerations, constraints, and business issues of DoD payload being accommodated as part of the commercial satellite design as opposed to a flexible hosted service?</p>
<p>&bull; What are potential cost considerations for accommodating a hosted payload in terms of initial cost to integrate, amount of commercial capability displaced, and on-going operations &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, continuing sustainment cost? For Government comparison purposes to other enterprise solutions, please offer cost estimates for hosting DoD payloads and follow-on O&amp;M during the lifetime of the payload/satellite.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Acquisition of a Modified Full End-to-End Commercial SATCOM System</span></p>
<p>The intent of this final topic is for DoD to purchase a modified (FAR Part 12) Commercial SATCOM system (space or space with ground components) as a firm fixed price commercial procurement. It is important that the purchased commercial system is interoperable and compatible with DoD user terminals, ground infrastructure, and other wideband MILSATCOM systems.</p>
<p>&bull; The above (Question 1) list of desired Military SATCOM features should be considered in responding to this RFI topic:</p>
<p>&bull; What are the current and planned commercial offerings that may be suitable for tailored use by the military?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the range of modifications to the commercial systems that could be accommodated while keeping the procured system within the intent of a firm fixed price contract?</p>
<p>&bull; Address any impacts to existing DoD ground and user terminal infrastructure that may be required to accommodate a modified Commercial SATCOM system</p>
<p>&bull; Please address any launch vehicle opportunities/constraints.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. General Business Context</span></p>
<p>For these alternatives, what is your model for Government acquisition arrangements? How do you see contract performance risk being allocated? What are your proposed provisions for Government oversight during the acquisition (configuration management of military functions, license arrangements, business oversight, design oversight, differences from DoD policies)? What sorts of performance warranties are envisioned? What DoD/Gov't procurement processes would need modification? What factors associated with insurance would the Gov't need to address?</p>
<p>What business arrangements/changes would increase DoD influence over commercial consideration of military capabilities? Factors include alignment with commercial customer sales models (e.g. compatibility, schedules), leases, sustainment (e.g. maintenance and configuration management of military capabilities), data rights, ITU military frequency filing constraints, commercial host nation constraints (e.g. shared teleports or control stations), FAR constraints (FAR Part 12/15), appropriations law (e.g. anti-deficiency act). Please specify the obstacles that limit the Government's ability to fully leverage commercial opportunities and your suggestions for eliminating or mitigating these obstacles.</p>
<p>Please provide an estimate of the cost impact associated with full DoD oversight.</p>

Project Description: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) project to providse the design and construction of a new Visitor Center and Headquarters at the Coastal NC National Wildlife Refuge Facility.
The Coastal NC NWRS Gateway Visitor Center and Headquarters facility will be approximately 17,840 SF and will be constructed on the north end of Roanoke Island, NC on a 35 acre parcel the Service purchased for this purpose.   Due to the location, there is an extremely high potential for visitation.  As a result, the expectation is that the new facility will serve as a "gateway" visitor center for all of the coastal North Carolina refuges and thus increase the visibility of and visitation to each of them.
The new facility will be designed and constructed around the Service's standard large 2-Story Administration/Visitor Center plan.  The modified plan will be further refined during the design phase. 
The Visitor Center will include a book store, exhibit space, an environmental education classroom, a multi-purpose room and exterior interpretive facilities. The Headquarters offices will be shared by approximately 30 Service employees. These personnel serve several Service programs including Alligator NWR, Pea Island NWR, Law Enforcement, Prescribed Fire, and the Ecological Services Red Wolf Recovery Team.  The facility will allow the Service to vacate existing GSA leased space which will save over $120,000 annually.
The facility will be LEED certified to the highest level practicable and will include water-saving elements i.e. rainwater harvesting, low-flow fixtures and grey water reuse.  The facility will be very energy efficient and will reduce, by a minimum of 30%, the average energy costs of a building of its size.  In addition, our goal is for at least 40% of the facilities energy needs to come from renewable energy sources.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with IBM Corporation of Bethesda, Maryland, to provide an additional year, date of award through one calendar year, of service of an existing IBM <span style="color: black;">Power5+ </span>high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by NOAA/NWS/NCEP under contract DG133W-02-CN-0013. The HPC system is located in NASA&rsquo;s Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) facility in Fairmont, West Virginia. This synopsis serves to notify the public of the proposed contract action.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The Government intends to modify the existing contract to extend the existing lease of a Power5+ system   one additional year.<span>&nbsp; </span>The system provides processing capability, storage, networking, software, services in support of operational activities associated with the Weather and Climate Supercomputing program. The existing HPC system was designed by IBM to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but disk storage and infrastructure to access existing data archives. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The system is an existing operational supercomputer cluster known as "Dew", comprised of an IBM P5+ p575 cluster employing 2368 Power5+ processors with 2GB memory per processor and 160 TB disk. IBM also provides system administration and other system related support services under the contract. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The HPC system &ldquo;Dew&rdquo; currently utilized by NCEP directly supports NOAA&rsquo;s strategic goals in Climate and Weather and Water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth&rsquo;s weather, climate and ocean. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The HPC system must provide a continuation of operational performance at least equivalent to Dew, including support of the IBM GPFS parallel filesystem and IBM&rsquo;s software suite, especially IBM compilers. The HPC system must be fully supported by system administrators and maintenance provided on a best effort basis. The HPC system must continue to support full integration with the existing tape archival system. In addition, the HPC systems must be integrated into NCEP&rsquo;s local area network</span><span> and NCEP&rsquo;s wide area network, supported by industry standard communications hardware/software. Both Verizon and Quest have points of presence within the Fairmont facility.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The estimated budget for the additional year of system utilization is approximately $700,000.00. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">NOAA anticipates leasing the hardware and software and purchasing software and system support services under fixed-price terms. Maintenance and support services will be included in the acquisition. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates and ability to furnish a production-ready system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements and a facility to support that system. Seamless integration of the HPC system into the existing infrastructure is required. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of system integration with zero disruption of NCEP&rsquo;s climate reanalysis project activities. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Vendors must include in their response an explanation, in detail, of its plan to implement and manage integration with the existing HPC and communications systems. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Affirmative responses must be received within fourteen (14) after publication of this synopsis.</span></p>

PMIS # 150682
TAS 14 1041
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (JOFOC) Task Order under GSA Areawide Public Utility Contract
1. 	This document is a justification for other than full and open competition prepared by the Department of Interior's National Park Service (NPS) - WASO-WCP.  This action supports the Golden Gate (GOGA) National Recreation Area (NRA).
2. 	The nature and/or description of the action being approved:  
This justification provides the rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition for the acquisition of support services to the GOGA NRA electrical distribution project.  The proposed project would permit the NPS to eventually replace the existing twin diesel generators with photovoltaic panels and distribution of surplus solar-power generated at Alcatraz Island to the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) power grid.  
3. 	Description of the supplies or services required, include an estimated value:
The required support services consist of reviewing the draft and final Predesign Reports feasibility analysis, design alternatives, and schematic design for conformance with PG&E standards, also providing necessary design engineering standards.  These items may be accomplished by working with agency contacts, participating in public and interagency meetings, and reviewing study results and early designs.  PG&E must also secure land use authorization and rights-of-way for the submarine electrical distribution cable for lands outside of NPS administrative jurisdiction.  The principle reasons for PG&E being the only available source is that they are the only utility provider for this area and they need to be assured that all phases of this project are coordinated through them in order to conform with their standards so they may ultimately take ownership of the submarine and ground-based electrical distribution cable.  The estimated value of this phase of the project is $30,000.  This is in line with rates applicable to the required personnel.
4. 	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The NPS has a requirement for utility services, for which there is only one utility provider for this area.



5. 	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: 
There is only one utility provider for this area, which is PG&E.  They have an existing GSA areawide public utility contract and the NPS will use this existing contract to issue a task order for the required effort.
6. 	Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable:  
The Contract Specialist checked the California Public Utility website to verify that PG&E is the only utility provider to service this area.
7. 	Description of the market survey conducted, and the results, or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: 
The required support services are only available from PG&E because their involvement is required at each phase of the overall project in order for the project to conform with PG&E's standards so that PG&E will ultimately take ownership of the submarine and ground-based electrical distribution cable.
8. 	Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  
None
9. 	Sources, if any, that expressed an interest in writing in the acquisition:   
No other sources expressed interest in this requirement.
10. 	The actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:
There exist no such barriers.


Contracting Officer:	I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to theGovernment will be fair and reasonable and certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<a href="mailto:dennis.ball@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The Weapons Accessories (WPNAC) Special Operations Peculiar Modification Kit (SOPMOD) Program managed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development and Acquisition directed toward optics, electronics, processes, systems, subsystems and components in support of our nation's war fighters.  The WPNAC program's primary mission is to provide Special Operations Forces (SOF) with the flexibility and versatility to adapt basic issue weapons to meet SOF mission-specific requirements.  SOF lack organic heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery and are limited in capacity to carry or resupply ammunition.  Therefore, success and survival often depends on the effective employment of individual and crew served weapons. Items contained within WPNAC Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) kit enhance the weapon's operational effectiveness through increased target recognition/acquisition, speed of engagement, and accuracy from Close Range Engagements to the maximum effective range of the weapon during both day and night conditions.  These items include Displays & Peripherals, Night Vision/Electro-Optics and Laser based fire control systems.  Items contained within the SOPMOD Kit enhance the weapon's operational effectiveness through increased target recognition/acquisition, speed of engagement, and accuracy from Close Range Engagements (CRE 0-50m) to the maximum effective range of the weapon (600m) during both day and night conditions.  Within these mission areas the SOPMOD Program is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and SOF war fighter support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.      
The objective of this announcement is to release a draft performance specification for MDNS Visible Bright Light (VBL) with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-VBL, Phase performance specification is Friday, 04 December 2009.
Failure to provide written feedback to the draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.
It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  
This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest is this program is appreciated.
Questions should be directed to Mr. Dennis J. Ball, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NC, telephone 812-854-2129, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail dennis.ball@navy.mil or Mr. J.

Description of Action: This is a new requirement, Firm Fixed Price, for the period of performance  29 Sep 2009 to 28 Sep 2010.  This approval is being requested for the purchase of services to convert medical and dental records in a secured and digital format in order to  provide military personnel with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility.  The records and documents to be managed are vital and require high quality resolution during the imaging process.  The type of funds to be used is DHP.<BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services: Implementation and advancement of the Digital Accessible Personal Health Electronic Record (DAPHER) initiative to convert and provide military personnel with the Section 508 accessible medical and dental records in a secure, digital format. Service members on active duty, or upon separation, will be able to access his/her private, personal health record formatted to be reviewed regardless of physical or cognitive disability or limitation.  This service is currently not available and resulted from a pilot project administered through the Department of Defense in FY2006.  The cost of the DAPHER is $799,997.90.<BR><BR>4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501(a)(2)(ii). <BR><BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  (The approporiation FY2009 Budget mandate purchase service for DAPHER from VASTEC Inc (See Attached e-mail)). VASTEC, Inc formerly affiliated with OTH Services, Inc., is a provider of compliant, knowledge management, service and content information.  The DAPHER project accelerates the conversion of military personnel health and dental records in a format compatible with existing assistive technology, handheld wireless devices and Section 508 accessibility requirements.  In FY2006, a pilot project was sponsored by Congress for the development of technology and delivery system that would allow service members, regardless of physical or cognitive disability or limitation, to review their private, personal health records.  Now completed and available for use, DAPHER will be compliment with existing Electronic Medical Records Projects, focused on physicians and clinical needs, by providing personnel an opportunity to review his/her own pertinent health information. Since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the need for disability awareness and resources has become even more prevalent with the returning Warfighers.  Over 100,000 American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines have been wounded while serving our country; therefore, it is even more imperative to allow these Warfighers equal access to their health information in a format that is accessible by all.  The DAPHER initiative helps personnel who have a need to know about his/her health conditions in order to better understand his/her health posture.  By granting access to these health records, this project will also relieve the burden on physicians and hospital administration by eliminating the need to reproduce cumbersome paper records. <BR>Item Name:  Digital Accessible Personal Health Electronic Record (DAPHER).  The following is information from the Appropriation FY2009 Budget:<BR><BR>	Account:  Defense Health Program<BR><BR>	Intended Recipient:  VASTEC, Inc. formally name (OTH Services)<BR>                                 	          President:  Sara G.

Efforts to Obtain Competition:  There are currently no efforts to obtain competition for this acquisition. This requirement will not be competed since it is specifically Congressionally earmarked funding for VASTEC, Inc.<BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  This requirement will be posted as sole source procurement in FedBizOps.  <BR><BR>8. Market Research: A Statement of Need was developed, by MEDCOM PASBA, with five requirements to ensure that the vendors that were contacted would have the capability to meet those needs.  Specifically, the requirements are:  Section 508 compliant with the Rehabilitation Act, Adobe 9.0 PDF searchable images, Optical Character Resignation (OCR), Secure File Transfer Protocols (SFTP), and the ability to convert optical images into digitized records.  Five vendors were contacted  OTH Services (now VASTEC, Inc), McKesson, GE Healthcare, Siemens, and Med Quist - via conventions and/or demonstrations at PASBA to determine a fair market price for the digitations initiative.  Costing is reflective in the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) provided.   <BR><BR>9. Interested Sources:  There were no written expressed interests received in this project to date.   IAW FAR 5.201, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, the requirement will be posted in FedBizOpps,  as a sole source requirement, but any proposals received will only be considered if they meet all the customers requirements from their Statement of Need.<BR><BR>10. Other Facts: The DHP O&M funding identified was earmarked by Senator Harkin, and approved from Congress for this specific program and a specific contractor (VASTEC, Inc. formally known as OTH Services).  The failure to utilize these earmarked funding for the identified project will impact PASBAs mission of making our wounded Soldiers medical records compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  <BR>

<p>Evaluation Criteria.

By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services.

<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-03-H-5009-0039. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

(a) Initially the offers will be evaluated for responsiveness.  In order to be considered responsive, the offeror must accept and meet all solicitation requirements.  Any offeror deemed non-responsive will not be considered for award.  

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered, using best value/trade off method.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

a)  	Quality of Services			
b)  	Timeliness of Services				
c)  	Customer Satisfaction & Business Relations

*Note: The Government may use any comments provided by past performance references to validate numerical responses.

The Past Performance subfactors Quality of Services, Timeliness of Services, and Customer Satisfaction & Business Relations, are equal in importance.  The subfactor Similarity of Experience, is more important than each of the other individual subfactors.

The relative importance of the factors is: Contractor Qualifications is approximately to Past performance. Contractor Qualifications when combined with Past performance is approximately equal to price. 
	
  	Contractor Qualifications:  Qualifications will be evaluated on a Pass or Fail basis.  To receive a Pass rating, an offerors proposal must meet all licensure, training, and certification requirements as outlined in the Performance Work Statement.   Failure to meet all licensure, training, and certification requirements as outlined in the Performance Work Statement will result in the offeror being ineligible for award. (see Attachment A, Paragraph 12.)
	
	Price Evaluation:   The Contracting Officer will use price analysis to determine price fair and reasonable.  Offerors MUST provide pricing for all line items on Attachment A for each year.  Incomplete proposals may be determined as ineligible for award.    In evaluating price, the following estimated measures will be used to evaluate the base and each option year:	

	Monthly Liebert Service:  		
		Offered price  X  12 each services = evaluated price 

	Quarterly Air Handler, Boiler, and Chiller Services:
		Offered price  X  4 each services = evaluated price	

	Yearly Service for Building 949:
		Offered price  X  1 each service = evaluated price
		
	Estimated On-Call Service and Emergency Service (Monday-Friday, 8am to 5pm):
		Offered price per hour  X  Est. number of hours = evaluated price
		(Estimated number of hours per year is 350 for evaluation purposes)

	Estimated On-Call Service and Emergency Service (Night/Weekends):
		Offered price per hour  X  Est. number of hours = evaluated price
		(Estimated number of hours per year is 50 for evaluation purposes)

	Estimated Number of Trip Charges:
		Offered price per trip  X  Est. number of service calls = evaluated price
		(Estimated number of service calls per year is 40 for evaluation purposes)

	Percentage of Mark Up on Supplies/Equipment used in direct support of On-Call Repair 	and Emergency Repair: 							
										%  

		(Est. contractor cost of supplies/equipment X  Offered Percentage Mark Up) + 	 
		Est. contractor cost of supplies/equipment = evaluated price
		(Estimated contractor cost of supplies/equipment is $8000.00 for evaluation 	purposes)

	Note:  The number of service hours, service calls, and dollar value of supplies/equipment are estimates only and does not represent or guarantee any minimum or maximum number during the base year or any exercised option year. 
	
	(See Attachment A, Paragraph 5)

Past Performance Evaluation:  In evaluating past performance, the Government will use the Past Performance Scores provided by the offerors references, and may use other sources of information, including, but not limited to federal, state and local government agencies, Better Business Bureaus, published media, electronic databases and contractors performance on DeCA contracts.  The evaluation of past performance will consider relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government will evaluate past performance as an indicator of future performance.  The determination is a matter of judgment.  Past performance scores will be averaged and weighted according to the evaluation plan.  If any response is not applicable, that question will not be used as a part of the average and the weighting will be distributed within the sub-factor to standardize the total points available.  Points will then be averaged by sub-factor, and converted to an adjectival rating based on the evaluation plan rating matrix.  If pertinent information other than that submitted by the Offerors references is used, overall ratings may be changed based on that information.  If neither the business nor any key personnel have a record of relevant past performance, the Government will rate past performance neither favorably nor unfavorably.  (See Attachment A, Paragraph 11.)

(b) Options and Price Evaluation. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total evaluated price for all options to the total evaluated price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract after signature by both parties, or signature by the government and performance by the contract awardee.

(ix)  Provision 52.212-4501 IAW FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies to this acquisition.  

  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
1.	Price
2.	Past Performance

I.  Price:  
1.	Price will be evaluated by adding the total price for CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002.  An offerors total price will be calculated as follows:
 	Offerors CLIN 0001 rate will be multiplied by 2 quarters (quarterly maintenance)  
	Offerors CLIN 0002 Hourly Rate (Normal duty hours) will be multiplied by 260 hours
	Offerors CLIN 0002 Hourly Rate: (Other than normal duty hours) will be multiplied by 40 hours
	Offerors CLIN 0002 Trip Charge (Round trip) will be multiplied by 20 trip charges
	Offerors CLIN 0002 Percentage of mark up on parts will be multiplied by $10,000.00
	Results of the above five calculations will then be added together to come up with a total price 	for evaluation purposes.  The multiples used are only estimates used for evaluation purposes.  The 	estimates used in the calculation in no way obligate the Government.   
2.	Labor rates should cover the required amounts as dictated by the Department of Labor Wage Determination No. 2005-2545, Revision No.11 dated 10/05/2009.  See Attachment D.    

II.  Past Performance will be evaluated based on the following sub-factors listed in descending order of importance:   
1.	Timeliness of Performance
2.	Quality of Work
3.	Business Relations

In evaluating past performance, the Government will use the Past Performance Surveys (Attachment C) provided by the offerors references, and may use other sources of information, including, but not limited to federal, state and local government agencies, Better Business Bureaus, published media, electronic databases and contractors performance on DeCA contracts.  The evaluation of past performance will consider relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government will evaluate past performance as an indicator of future performance.  The determination is a matter of judgment.

The relative importance of the factors is:  Price/price related factors are equal to past performance.

  (b) Options (if included in the Schedule). The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

(x)  Offerors shall include with their offer a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) and Alternate 1,.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220.The work will primarily consist of fire protection installation and repairs (new construction and renovation) with some design capabilities. The preponderance of the work will include fire suppression systems (wet, dry, pre-action, wet chemical, deluge, high speed deluge and ultra high speed deluge), water supplies (fire pumps, tanks and underground water mains), low and high expansion foam, gaseous (carbon dioxide and clean agents) special hazards protection and fire alarm systems (detection, reporting and mass communication) and fire protection surveys.  The solicitation will result in a maximum of five D/B FP MACC awards. The majority of the work will have a value between $100,000 and $1 million. The contract vehicle may also be used to occasionally solicit projects ranging in value between $1 million and $3.5 million. The contract will have a 12-month base year and four potential 12-month option years. The estimated maximum value over the total life of the contract is $30 million.
Proposers will be evaluated using the two-phase request for proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.
Phase I is the pre-qualification phase. Phase I factors relate to the five-year ID/IQ contract requirements for fire protection installation and repairs (new construction and renovation) and some design capabilities. A maximum of five firms will be pre-qualified in Phase I and will advance to and participate in Phase II - Technical Solutions and Price. 
For Phase I, offerors will be evaluated on the following factors:FACTOR 1 - Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience SUBFACTOR 1A - Design TeamSUBFACTOR 1B - Construction TeamFACTOR 2 - Technical Qualifications SUBFACTOR 2A - Design TeamSUBFACTOR 2B - Construction TeamFACTOR 3 - Management Approach	SUBFACTOR 3A - Management ApproachSUBFACTOR 3B - Design, Construction and Quality ControlSUBFACTOR 3C - Safety and Experience Modifier Rate (EMR)
In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors will submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project and addressing other factors that define the quality requirements for the seed project. Offerors claiming professional designation shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options within the Government's published budget for award. Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order. The Best Value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project. Four offerors will receive a Design/Build Fire Protection Multiple Award Construction Contract (D/B FP MACC) that will include a minimum guarantee of $10,000. 
FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD: The successful offerors awarded an ID/IQ D/B FP MACC in Phase II will compete on future task orders. Offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals for all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in the pre-proposal conferences or site visits for the initial award or any task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the Best Value continuum or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. If the Government decides to award a task order based on the Best Value continuum, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements of the task order.
NOTE: Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a Department of Defense (DoD) contract. Offerors are further advised that failure to register their firm in/with the CCR database may render your firm ineligible for award. Contractors not already registered are highly encouraged to do so. For more information, see the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.

The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Germantown, Maryland that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 86,000 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 74,000 continuous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet. The lease term required is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2010. The delineated area is Ridge Road to the North to Frederick Road on the East to Middlebrook Road to the South to Father Hurley Blvd to the west.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Parking (# of on site, reserved spaces [inside vs. outside] for official Government vehicles</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Others. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing leas space or to relocate to alternative space. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington D.C. 20593-0001<br />Telephone 202-372-3695<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

(1)  Agency and Contracting Activity -- U.S. Coast Guard, ALC C-130 Long Range Surveillance  Branch, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  Approval is requested to procure, on a sole-source basis, the purchase of HC-130J Multi Mode Radar Radome.  This is a commercial item also utilized on Commercial Canadian Aircraft that will be procured utilizing the procedures in FAR Part 12.  The proposed contractor is Cobham Sensor Systems  DBA Nurad, of Baltimore MD, the original equipment manufacturer of the Multi Mode Radar Radome.  Pricing is Firm Fixed Price (FFP) provided on Quote # MTM 4492-1.

(3)  Description of Supplies/Services  The requirement is to provide Radome spares on the C-130J aircraft.  The total estimated value of this procurement is $258,982.00.  In addition an IGE was completed and the (FFP) is considered to be reasonable for a system of this complexity.  
(4)  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited.  Cobham Sensor System Nurad Division is the original equipment manufacturer of theRadome.  This is the only known firm who can provide approved spare parts, repairs, engineering design changes and product improvements. Cobham Sensor Systems owns the rights to the proprietary data, specifications and drawings necessary for performance and has the staff and extensive experience necessary to maintain and improve Radome performance/reliability. 

(6)  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential 
 sources as is practicable.  A combined synopsis/solicitation will be submitted via Federal Business Opportunity upon approval of this J&A. Cobham Sensor Systems is the only known OEM authorized for this procurement.

(7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government
 will be fair and reasonable. It is the Contracting Officers opinion that the (FFP) has been determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with the pricing of similar Radar systems and the Radomes of those systems

(8)  Description of Market Research   Market research was conducted by researching Fed Log, ILS, and Haystack for additional suppliers and contacting Cobham Sensor Systems for distributors. A sources sought was also placed on Feb Biz Ops under HSCG38-09-S-H00003 the only response received was from Cobham Sensor Systems Since Cobham Sensor Systems is the only firm owning the rights to the proprietary technical data required for performance, additional competition is not expected.  Any other feasible source would have to build or modify existing equipment utilizing Cobham Sensor Systems Nurad division drawings that are proprietary and cannot be provided to third parties.  

(9)  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition. All of the data, specifications, manuals, and drawings necessary to perform this requirement are proprietary to the OEM.  Cobham Sensor Systems Nurad division is the only firm who has the technical data necessary to produce the required Spares, Repairs and approved replacement parts necessary for Radome performance.

(10)  A Listing of the Sources, if Any, Which Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.    A combined synopsis/solicitation will be submitted via Federal Business Opportunity upon approval of this J&A.  If any responses are received, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors.

(11)  A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required.  In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, ALC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD).  Subsequently, a representative of the NPD Branch was reassigned to the HC-130 Product Line.  This representative has the responsibility to locate alternate sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products.  Engineering, contracting and NPD representatives continuously conduct market research buy using ILS, FEDLOG, Hay Stack, and placing sources sought notices on FEDBIZOPS.  To ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements.

(12) Technical / Requirements Personnel Certification 

I hereby certify this document meets the Governments minimum need and that the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification is complete and accurate.

Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote.  Evidence of other certifications, such as a DOD Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer.   Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair".  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the reparables.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. Contractor is to provide FAA Certifications or DOD certifications with their proposal.  The USCG, ALC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

An updated CMRA business process, Version 3.0, has been implemented starting with the reporting of Fiscal Year 2006 information. 
The contractor is required to completely fill in all required contractor information directly to the CMRA website:  https://cmra.army.mil
Although the contractor is required to complete this information, as a courtesy, USMA will pre-populate the database, to include an estimate for contractor manpower.  We strongly encourage you to visit the website and review our estimate and revise, if necessary.  
The information to be collected includes, by contract, delivery order/task order number, the funding source and related financial data, organization receiving the services, mission/function performed, and labor hours and costs by Government Fiscal Year (1 October through 30 September)CMRA will enable the Army to (i) fully understand the composition of the Army workforce - military, civilian, and contractor, and allow for more informed workforce staffing and funding decisions; (ii) provide better oversight of our workforce, avoid duplication of effort, or shifting of in-house reductions to contract; and (iii) better account for and explain our total Army workforce. Data must be entered into the CMRA Application at any time during the contracts period of performance (POP).  Data must be accurate and complete, and entered into the CMRA by Government Fiscal Year (FY), 1 October through 30 September, for each FY that falls within the POP.  For delivery order/task order type contracts, each separate delivery/task order is recorded.  Information must be entered into CMRA NLT than 31 October of each fiscal year being serviced in the contract.  The actual information to be entered by Contractors is as follows:  1.	Contract Number 2.	Delivery Order Number (If applicable) 3.	Task Order Number (If applicable) 4.	Requiring Activity Unit Identification Code ( UIC)5.	Command  6.	Contractor Contact Information 7.	Federal Service Code (FSC)8.	Direct Labor Hours 9.	Direct Labor Dollars 10.

<DESC>The anticipated issue date of the Solicitation 8010-01 is October 30, 2009 with a closing date of December 1, 2009.
Solicitation 8010-01 seeks on call (OC) flight services consisting of small (not more than 7,000 pounds approved gross weight), turbine engine, minimum of three-passenger seat helicopters to support Department of the Interior, (DOI) bureaus and cutomers in their transport needs within the Conterminous 48 States.  Contractor services include provisions of small helicopters, pilot(s), fuel, aircraft maintenance support, and all other associated equipment, as prescribed in the government's solicitation.  Mission activities are for interagency fire management program and other related resource support and may include, but are not limited to, fire suppression, fire monitoring, initial attack, prescribed fire, aerial ignition, rehabilitation seeding, offshore vessel landings and extended over water flights and nd other administrative activities.   The Government reserves the right to negotiate pricing with those offering helitorch pricing and availability of seeding buckets in the event individual projects of 30 days or less are needed and are planned in advance by DOI bureaus and customers.  If you are interested in supporting fire management program aircraft activities for DOI bureaus and customers you should submit an offer in response to this solicitation.  DOI ARAs do not provide fire management support to DOI bureaus and customers. 
Contractor(s) must possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificates issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133 and 137.   Aircraft offered must also be carried on the Contractor's list required by 14 CFR Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate.  
The contract period will be from the May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011 for the first year with options to renew for two additional years.   This is the only DOI on call small helicopter solicitation that is planned for issuance for the next three years.   If you operate types of aircraft that meet the minimum aircraft requirements and are interested in supporting the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal as provided herein and be awarded a contract from the solicitation. Multiple awards are expected to be made.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  
It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  
Solicitation information will be available through the fedbizopps site (found under Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, NBC, Aviation Management Headquarters, Boise, ID) and at http://amd.nbc.gov.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns.  AFTER READING THE SOLICITATION, questions may be directed to Toni Musgrove, 208-433-5022, Toni_Musgrove@nbc.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to update expected availability dates for the draft and final solicitations and to add information regarding the expected procurement.  The draft solicitation will be made available for review and comment by potential offerors on or about 06 November 2009 through FEDBIZOPPS.  All questions and comments on the draft solicitation must be submitted by 04 December 2009 and addressed to Chris Thompson at chris.thompson1@navy.mil.  All questions and comments will be considered in preparation of the final solicitation.  The final solicitation will be available on or about 07 December 2009.  The anticipated workforce distribution is corrected as follows: It is projected that that 95% of the work performed will be conducted in an integrated Government-Contractor Team environment, within Government work spaces, and work in accordance with Government processes (90% at China Lake and 5% at Pt Mugu).  The remaining 5% of the contractor personnel shall utilize contractor facilities.  The following is also incorporated regarding companies that are eligible to propose for this procurement:  All offerrors must hold facility clearances at the Top Secret Level in order to be considered responsive.  Much of the integration efforts will involve information that is not releasable to foreign persons and/or entities, therefore no Foreign Owned Controlled or Influenced (FOCI) firms are permitted to compete as the prime contractor for this effort.  FOCI firms may be allowed to participate as subcontractors subject to an approved export license obtained by the prime.   Any access by FOCI firms to proscribed information may only be granted after obtaining an approved National Interest Determination.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>GSA IS HEREBY REQUESTING PHASE ONE PROPOSALS. This Phase One Solicitation provides Offerors with instructions regarding the submission of their complete Proposals and the evaluation thereof. Utilizing the format prescribed within, Offerors are to provide the requested information and demonstrate their qualifications. Responses shall be as complete and accurate as possible and present data relative to the specific Project under consideration. Offerors shall make every effort to present information clearly and concisely in accordance with the formats described herein.</p>
<p>A. PHASE ONE - REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ)</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements: The following evaluation factors will be evaluated on a "go/no-go" basis, i.e.; offerors not meeting all of the following criteria will be eliminated from further consideration. The Contracting Officer will make the initial determination as to offer responsibility/responsiveness, and submit only those offers to the SSEB for full evaluation.</p>
<p>a. Qualifications Statement conforms to the requirements of the Request For Qualifcations (RFQ), including, but<br />not limited to:<br />&bull; Proof of CCR Registration<br />&bull; Proof of bonding capacity to $80,000,000.<br />b. Qualifications Statement must meet the minimum requirements of the RFQ</p>
<p>PHASE ONE EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>Phase One of this solicitation will evaluate the qualifications of the Design Builder. The combined factor total of the Design Builder is significantly more important than the Lead Designer. The combined factor total of the Lead Designer is significantly more important than the Design Team.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS - DESIGN BUILDER</p>

<p><br />F. SUMMARY OF THE PHASE TWO SOLICITATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The following information is provided in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.303-1(a)(3). DO NOT SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO PHASE TWO EVALUATION FACTORS AT THIS TIME. Only firms selected during the Phase One evaluation process will be requested to submit a response to Phase Two.<br />The most highly qualified Offerors selected in Phase One will be provided the opportunity to submit competitive technical and price Proposals as detailed in the Phase Two Solicitation. Phase Two will require an acknowledgment by each Offeror that the selected Offeror will comply with all the mandatory performance criteria, technical specifications, and space program requirements within a pre-established maximum cost for the complete Project. Phase Two shall be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation); one Contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors to be used in Phase Two are listed below in descending order of importance. While price is an important consideration, all non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit (as determined by the evaluation of the non-price evaluation factors set forth below), the evaluated price becomes more important and may become the determining factor for award. The non-price evaluation factors are set out below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>Phase Two Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed Technical Solutions <br />&bull; Project Management Plan</p>
<p>All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-08P-09-JA-C-0089. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed. Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This is a modification to an existing contract task order. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District issued a task order modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds on contract task order DACW41-99-D-9001-0005. The project was competed as a Site Specific Environmental Restoration Contract (SSERC)under solicitation number DACW41-98-R-0034. The contract was awarded to Shaw Environmental, Inc. formerly Stone and Webster Environmental and Technology Services(CAGE CODE: 1YN99). This is a modification to a remedial action contract for the removal of radioactive contaminated waste located at the FUSRAP Maywood Superfund Site, Maywood, New Jersey. This work is for remedial action at the designated areas of Stepan Property, Scanel Property and NYS&W Property, all located at the FUSRAP Maywood Superfund Site, Maywood, New Jersey.<BR><BR>The objective of this remediation project is to remove radiological contaminated soil and material and restore the site to pre-existing conditions. This will require pre and postexcavation waste characterization sampling; radiological monitoring, design and construction of excavation areas; excavation; operation of a temporary water treatment system during excavation dewatering activities; physical separation of excavated material with different waste classifications; and off-site transportation of contaminated soils and material.<BR><BR>Procurement of a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to the existing SSERC Task Order will offer significant flexibility for responding to conditions that are unexpected, such as the removal of uncertain soil volume quantities and unknown buried materials. Additionally,the USACE Maywood project team is capable and prepared to provide qualified staff for monitoring contractor performance to mitigate risks and to ensure that all alternatives have been considered. The project team is also able and has experience to monitor the task order to ensure that performance, cost and schedule goals are being met, including but not limited to: implementing quality assurance procedures established for the contract, and completing timely contractor performance evaluations that accurately reflect the contractors actual performance.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>1. Contracting Activity: Center for Health Care Contracting, MEDCOM Health Care Acquisition Activity, 2107 17th St., Bldg 4197, Ste 68, Fort Sam Houston, TX  78234-5068.<BR><BR>2. Description of Action: This is a new requirement, Firm Fixed Price, for the period of performance  29 Sep 2009 to 28 Sep 2010.  This approval is being requested for the purchase of services to convert medical and dental records in a secured and digital format in order to  provide military personnel with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility.  The records and documents to be managed are vital and require high quality resolution during the imaging process.  The type of funds to be used is DHP.<BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services: Implementation and advancement of the Digital Accessible Personal Health Electronic Record (DAPHER) initiative to convert and provide military personnel with the Section 508 accessible medical and dental records in a secure, digital format. Service members on active duty, or upon separation, will be able to access his/her private, personal health record formatted to be reviewed regardless of physical or cognitive disability or limitation.  This service is currently not available and resulted from a pilot project administered through the Department of Defense in FY2006.  The cost of the DAPHER is $799,997.90.<BR><BR>4. The DAPHER project accelerates the conversion of military personnel health and dental records in a format compatible with existing assistive technology, handheld wireless devices and Section 508 accessibility requirements.    <BR><BR>5. DAPHER will be compliment with existing Electronic Medical Records Projects, focused on physicians and clinical needs, by providing personnel an opportunity to review his/her own pertinent health information. Since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the need for disability awareness and resources has become even more prevalent with the returning Warfighers.  Over 100,000 American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines have been wounded while serving our country; therefore, it is even more imperative to allow these Warfighers equal access to their health information in a format that is accessible by all.  The DAPHER initiative helps personnel who have a need to know about his/her health conditions in order to better understand his/her health posture.  By granting access to these health records, this project will also relieve the burden on physicians and hospital administration by eliminating the need to reproduce cumbersome paper records. <BR><BR>Item Name:  Digital Accessible Personal Health Electronic Record (DAPHER).  <BR>Account:  Defense Health Program<BR><BR>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  There are currently no efforts to obtain competition for this acquisition. This requirement will not be competed since it is specifically Congressionally earmarked funding for VASTEC, Inc.<BR>

<AWARDEE>Nordic Air, Inc. (DUNS 187116348)5455 N River Rd WGeneva, OH 44041-9315
<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5).  See posted J&A for further information (see below).  The Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia 22134, has awarded a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract with Nordic Air, Inc. of Geneva, OH. This contract action is for USMC fielded models of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) for a total quantity of up to 80 units.  These enhanced ECUs are required due to a configuration change necessitated by new Environmental Protection Agency regulations mandating a change to refrigerant gas utilization effective 1 January 2010 and impending operational needs during Spring 2010.  In addition to the ongoing deployment operations of these ECUs in the near term, the procurement will also support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The 80 units will be comprised of up to 20 each of the following: 18,000 BTU/hr, 36,000 BTU/hr, 60,000 BTU/hr, and 120,000 BTU/hr.  The action encompasses a one time contract award to Nordic Air, Inc. for $1,450,420.00. The Government has awarded a contract to Nordic Air, Inc., under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (g)(1)(B) as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a).  "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items." The contract term will be date of award through six months. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 333415 number of employees is 750. 
MCSC CT 025J&A NO: 13,146JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A)TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Competition Advocate, hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action(s) described herein using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (g)(1)(B).
 JUSTIFICATION1.  Contracting Activity
Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM)GTES Contract Group (CT025)2200 Lester Street Quantico, VA 22134-6050
2.	Nature of Action Being Approved
The proposed contract action is to procure 20 each of the 18,000 BTU/hr model Environmental Control Unit (ECU), 36,000 BTU/hr ECU model, 60,000 BTU/hr ECU model, 120,000 BTU/hr ECU model.  The proposed action encompasses award of a one time Contract to Nordic Air Inc. of Geneva, Ohio.   
3.   Description of Supplies/Services
This contract action is for USMC fielded models of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) for a total quantity of up to 80 units.  These enhanced ECUs are required due to a configuration change necessitated by new Environmental Protection Agency regulations mandating a change to refrigerant gas utilization effective 1 January 2010 and impending operational needs during Spring 2010.  In addition to the ongoing deployment operations of these ECUs in the near term, the procurement will also support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The 80 units will be comprised of up to 20 each of the following: 18,000 BTU/hr, 36,000 BTU/hr, 60,000 BTU/hr, and 120,000 BTU/hr.  The proposed action encompasses award of a one time contract award to Nordic Air, Inc. The articles and planned quantities to be procured are the following:
ECU Rating 	Vendor Model Number	Quantity18,000 BTU/hr	GS1H43ZAANWY001a	 2036,000 BTU/hr	GL0343ZAADWYX01a	 2060,000 BTU/hr	GL0543ZAADWYX01a	 20120,000 BTU/hr	GL1203ZAADWYX01a	 20
4.  Identification of Statutory Authority 
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (g)(1)(B) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501(a), "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items." 
5.  Rationale for Use of the Authority Cited
In 2008, MCSC awarded contract M67854-08-A-5023 to Nordic Air, Inc., using justification and approval for limited sources procurement contained in MCSC CT 025 J&A NO: 12,096.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 82 mandate change to an environmentally compliant refrigerant gas in future ECUs after 1 January 2010.   Current ECU models that we procure under our current contract through 2011 must comply after 1 January 2010.
Marine Corps Systems Command was funded for $3.5 million under the ARRA to effect changes, procure, test, and field the improved family of USMC ECUs.  In support of this effort, Bailment agreement M67854-09-L-5094 was entered into with Nordic Air, Inc., to evaluate the required hardware changes.  Under the bailment agreement, the USMC bailed 20 ECUs to Nordic Air, Inc., and Nordic Air has modified them to the future configuration.  These ECUs have been returned to the Government for testing in the updated configuration (2010 compliant).  This new configuration is to become the new USMC standard configuration, and will continue to be procured for the remainder of the contract life.  
The MARCORSYSCOM is now ready to procure the initial production run of the next generation of ECUs.  The General Services Administration (GSA) will not have these updated ECUs on its GSA Federal Supply Schedule soon enough to meet the USMC's requirement. 
It is estimated that GSA will not have updated pricing listed on the GSA schedule for these improved ECUs until Spring 2010.  If the USMC can not purchase until Spring 2010, it can not expect delivery until Summer of 2010 at the earliest. This delay will result in lack of ability to support Warfighter needs for improved ECUs as the USMC prepares for the summer of 2010 and hot weather operations in Afghanistan.
The Marine Corps Systems Command previously documented its need for ECU procurement in J&A NO: 12,096, and subsequently issued contract M67854-08-A-5023 to Nordic Air Inc.  The Program Manager and Contracting Officer had fully intended to utilize this contract to procure ECUs with ARRA funding, but has recently been made aware that this mechanism will not support operational requirements.  
6.  Efforts Made to Solicit Potential Sources
Given the special nature of these units due to previous testing, they are only available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer, no other sources were solicited.  A sole source notice was published on NECO on 06 August 2009 announcing the Government's intent to procure these goods from Nordic Air, Inc.  To date no interested parties have contacted the Contracting Officer.  Any expansion of interest received between now and contract award will be adjudicated and addressed appropriately.  
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost
In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer, along with the Program Manager, shall ensure that all supplies and services ordered under this contract are fair and reasonable.
8.  Description of Market Survey
     See paragraph 6 above.
9.  Other Factors Supporting Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition
The US Army solicited in 2008, competed, and awarded in June 2009 two competing contracts to develop ECUs that meet 3 out 4 of our requirements.  They will not have production solutions until 2013 at the earliest.  Neither the Army nor any other service has contracting opportunities to supply the USMC with necessary product in the interim. Any solicitation of potential sources would yield the same developmental timeframe to reach a fieldable product; the USMC does not have the luxury of a 4-year delay in supporting the warfighters need for ECUs.  
10.  Listing of Other Interested Sources 
        None
11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition
	 See paragraphs 5 & 6 above.
12. Statement of Delivery Requirement  The contractor will be required to deliver all items within 180 days.  It is anticipated that phased deliveries will start earlier.  First ECUs to be delivered will support Production Verification Testing, which is the most urgent requirement of this contract.  Later deliveries will support User Evaluations, and subsequent fielding.
13. Estimated Dollar Value of the Acquisition Covered by this Justification and Approval  The total estimated value of this procurement is $1.8 million.  This effort will be fully funded from ARRA funding already at Marine Corps Systems Command awaiting execution.
14. Acquisition Plan (AP)  Not applicable as this acquisition is less than $50,000,000 in accordance with DFARS 207.103(d)(i)(B).
15. Documentation for Spare and Repair Parts Acquisition No additional spares and repair parts are required under this procurement.

<DESC>663-P00408________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Justification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Puget Sound Medical Center2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of direct immunofluorescent (DFA) reagent kits for the detection of respiratory viruses (including influenza virus).3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This supply is integral in the performance of respiratory and influenza testing for VA patients. This is direct patient care product that directly supports health and well being for veterans.  4.  Statutory Authority:  	( X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;	( )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;	(  )  (4) International Agreement	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;	(  )  (6) National Security; or	(  )  (7) Public Interest5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  This respiratory DFA kit is unique in its detection of respiratory viruses using a "wet"  fluorescent antibody (FA) technique.This is a unique system that has no other comparable source. No other system uses the same unique proprietary reagents and no other system can detect some viruses detected with this system 6.  Actions to Promote Competition: The contracting officer has researched and found no other vendor who can provide this DFA Kit. In the future the contracting officer will conduct additional market research for any new vendors which may be able to provide this product.  7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 1250.00 per kit. I have reviewed past purchase orders to determine price reasonableness. PO # 663-Q99684 dated October 2009 was for $1320.00 for a similar product. Based on this price, the contract specialist has determined the cost of this detection kit is fair and reasonable.8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was performed. The contract officer verified that  Diagnostic Hybrids  is the sole source manufacturer and distributor for this diagnostic item. This is a unique product that provides sensitivity and specificity not found in other platforms. Review of other platforms by in-house scientific experts has revealed that no other platform exhibits the performance characteristics necessary in our facility.9.  Other Considerations:  This is a unique system. No other system is in existence that can perform the same testing. This product directly effects patient care and the community at large.10. Listing of Sources the expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None.  11. Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  Prior to making a sole source award to this vendor in the future, the contracting officer will research the market by submitting a sources sought notice through GSA E-buy and Fed Biz Ops to insure no other vendors can offer this item.  12. Requirements Certification:  I certify the that requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Vetereans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which is included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. ______//signed//_______________________	__10/28/2009____________Name: Robbin Traver	DateTitle: Microbiology SupervisorFacility: V.A.
