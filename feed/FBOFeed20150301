ARL requires concept development, fabrication, prototyping, and testing of advanced research and development efforts for customer-supported military applications.  <br>  <br> ARL's Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is the principal Army organization for executing basic and applied research in sensors, signal and image processing, electronic devices, and power and energy to ensure U.S. military superiority. SEDD conducts innovative research to provide the Army with affordable, enabling technologies in the following core technical competencies (CTC) and mission areas: electronic materials tailored to Army needs; electronics devices including electro-optics (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF) and flexible components; high energy and power dense materials and components for safe, agile and reliable power across demanding regimes and environments; and sensor processing to automatically transform sensor data to actionable information. Current research supports both the ARL Materials and Information Sciences CTCs. The Government has a mission to facilitate, demonstrate, and transition up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL 5) research and technology development within ARL, the Research, Development, Engineering Command (RDECOM), and the Army, with other services and agencies, and with industry and academia, to leverage basic and applied research opportunities for the benefit of the Army.  <br>
