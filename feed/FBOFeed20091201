New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org.) The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations and awards issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) After August 1, 2006, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments.

DSCP has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page.

The Health Interview National Trends Survey (HINTS) was conceived during a risk communication conference in 1997. Papers from this conference were published in a 1999 supplement of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. During this conference, attendees discussed the lack of population level data about health information and health communication variables and encouraged the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop a national communication population survey to provide baseline and follow-up data on the populations’ access to, need for, and use of cancer information. This call for the development of a national cancer communication survey coincided with an NCI designation of an Extraordinary Opportunity in Cancer Communication in the fiscal year 2001 budget.  Identification of cancer communication as an extraordinary opportunity has allowed the NCI to support scientific research to advance the discipline of cancer communication. A key component of the initiative was HINTS.  Building upon the interdisciplinary recommendations of the 1997 risk communication conference, NCI developed a national survey to assess trends in health information usage over time and to periodically conduct fundamental research to assess the basic relationships among cancer-related communication, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.

The most recent conference was held in Silver Spring, MD in September of 2009. The conference theme “Partners in Progress” speaks to the collaborative nature of the HINTS program. The conference included a series of oral presentations focused on the following themes: Partners, Populations, and Progress; Survey Methodology; Health Communication; and Media and Health Communication. The current proposed supplemental issue will build upon the oral presentations, poster presentations, and group discussions held at this meeting.

The contractor shall fulfill the following objectives in the supplement:

Objective 1: The contractor shall document the use of HINTS data to inform the science and practice of health communication so that other scientists, public health planners, and medical practitioners can benefit from the national data collection.

Objective 2:  The contractor shall include individual documents which present analyses of HINTS data collected against rigorous methodological requirements for sound surveillance research as a substantive collection of exemplary science from the HINTS initiative.

Objective 3:  The contractor shall collect a volume of documents, along with insightfully written introductory and concluding papers, which alert the broader field of health communication to the future of cancer communication practice and science during a time of dramatic transformation in technology, public health, and health care.

The Journal of Health Communication is a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal which documents important developments in the field of health communication rendering it the only outlet for research based on analyses of HINTS data. The research published in this journal spans a range of health communication topics consistent with the thematic tracks of the HINTS conference, including risk communication, health literacy, social marketing, interpersonal communication, and mass mediated communication. The journal draws upon and reaches a diversity of expertise including psychology, government, policy-making, and health education that mirrors the professional expertise of the HINTS community of data users.  The Journal of Health Communication serves a growing community of health communication scholars and professionals. As an interdisciplinary international journal with a professionally diverse readership, the journal has board reach. The Journal of Health Communication is published solely by Taylor & Francis Group.

<DESC>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) of the Division of Cancer and Genetics (DCEG) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is recompeting a requirement to continue dosimetry support services for epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to ionizing radiation, conducted by the REB.  The current contract is held by University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, N02-CP-55503.  This support is essential to REB’s ability to quantify radiation risks and provide information on dose-response relationships.  The contractor shall evaluate the radiotherapy records collected by the REB and determine whether the data are adequate to calculate organ doses and provide organ doses for individual study subjects to the REB for analysis.  The contractor shall provide the support necessary to make measurements on anthropomorphic phantoms, water phantoms, and/or use mathematical phantoms or computerized treatment planning programs or other resources in order to reconstruct radiation doses to specific organs following medical exposures.  The contractor shall: (1) assess and recommend the manner in which physical dosimetry can be best applied to the epidemiologic studies of interest, (2) coordinate dosimetry data collected or prepared by other collaborators who are participating in our studies, (3) estimate doses to designated organs or sites within organs, (4) compare various dosimetry methods to validate consistency and accuracy of estimated doses, (5) report doses to NCI, along with an indicator of the quality of radiotherapy information, and (6) provide dosimetry data to REB to conduct methodologic studies to evaluate the potential biases and uncertainties in the dose estimates.  

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement, and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded.  The anticipated period of performance is for one Base Year and four 1-year Option Periods.  The Government’s estimated requirement of 5,000 hours per year, for a total of 25,000 labor hours.

<CONTACT>Dawn Caracci, Senior Technical Advisor, Phone 410-965-9465, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to procure the services of a contractor to provide alternative means by which printed notices can be provided to the public. Currently, visually impaired claimants can receive notices from SSA in three ways: via regular first-class mail, certified mail, or first-class mail with a follow up call from SSA to read the document to the claimant. SSA will offer the choice of a Braille format for its notices or a data CD with Microsoft Word 2003 and PDF files, in addition to the three formats currently offered. The contractor will be required to convert notices to Braille and/or Microsoft Word on a Data CD and mail those notices to recipients <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">within 5 business days</span></em> (excluding government holidays) of receipt of the notice (files) from SSA. SSA anticipates the notices (files) will be provided daily, Monday through Friday, year round. <br /><br />BACKGROUND INFORMATION: SSA creates and distributes custom designed paper notices for its beneficiaries, in either English or Spanish, with notice length averaging 5 pages.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Expressions of Interest Sought 
Rosslyn, VA


The United States Government currently occupies approximately 117,119 BOMA rentable square feet (brsf) of office space and related space at 1400 Wilson Blvd., in Arlington, Virginia (commercially known as the “Architect Building”) under a lease that will be expiring.

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 117,119 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 105,180 of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  251 onsite structured parking spaces are required.  The lease term requirement is for 15 years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by April 1, 2010.  The delineated area is Rosslyn, Virginia.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  The GSA shall have access to the offered space 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The offered space must be near inexpensive and moderately priced fast food and/or eat-in restaurants that are within walking distance.  Other employee services such as retail shops, cleaners, and banks shall be located within ¼ mile.  The offered space must meet GSA requirements for security, seismic, and fire protection and life safety and handicapped accessibility (ABAAS).  

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and must include the following information:

•	Building name and address.

•	Rentable Square Feet (RSF) available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced along with tenant improvement allowance of $42.08 per ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet.

•	ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced tenant improvement allowance of $42.08 per ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet.

•	Date of space availability.

•	Method of rentable space measurement.

•	Name, address, telephone number, and email address of Owner’s Representative.

•	Owner’s name and address and written statement from owner identifying Owner’s Representative and granting it authority to provide information on the property.

•	Parking Availability

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  The Government’s decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Government’s requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

<DESC>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to refurbish the severely damaged pump #5 at the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier.  The vertical axial flow pump is one of five stationed at the facility, which spans across the Providence River and provides flood damage protection to downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The 4500 hp electric pumps each have a capacity of 625,000 gal/min and convey inflows from the Providence River and its tributaries (protected side) into Providence Harbor during times when the storm surge river gates are activated. This project consists of a complete overhaul of Pump #5 including testing, repair and certification of the 40 ton overhead crane, and refurbishment of two cooling water control gate operators.<BR><BR>During the Pump #5 overhaul, the remaining four pumps must be kept operational. <BR>Before work can begin on Pump #5, stop gates must be installed and the intake chamber must be dewatered.  Pump #5 required work includes separating the approximate 50-ton motor from the pump using the in-house crane, removing the damaged pump impeller from its shaft (requiring 400 tons of force), removing the shaft cover pipe, guide bearings, and miscellaneous other components.  Said components shall be transported to a service center for cleaning, inspection, and complete evaluation.  Damaged or worn parts shall be replaced or refurbished as appropriate. The 15,000 lb, 10 diameter. 4.5 high impeller is beyond repair and a new cast iron impeller must be fabricated and finish machined. Pump diffuser and discharge housing components, roughly 32 high and 10 in diameter, must be evaluated in-place for cracks, pitting and other damage.  Cracked areas will be repaired using the metal stitching method and pitting by use of a metal repair product.  All components shall be sandblasted prior to examination. Upon completion of repairs carbon metal components are to be coated with a coal-tar epoxy system. The motor and pump must be reassembled in a precisely aligned manner.  The reassembled pump shall undergo dry and wet vibration and bearing temperature analysis and realigned at the contractors expense if the test results fall outside accepted criteria.<BR><BR>During the control gates refurbishing, one gate must remain functional at all times. These gates provide cooling water to the Dominion power plant.  One gate is currently in the down position and the operator is non-functional. It requires refurbishment. The other gate is operational but the operator requires refurbishment of the gear boxes and drive gears.   <BR><BR>The contract is estimated to be in the range of $1-5 million. <BR><BR>The anticipated issue date is December 15, 2009. <BR>

<DESC>This is not the Solicitation.  The solicitation should be posted on or about December 7th, 2009<BR><BR>PURPOSE:<BR>The purpose of work is to assess the current sediment yield and the feasibility of sediment reduction measures in agricultural and mixed-use watersheds of the Lower Snake River Basin. The assessment data and findings will support development of the Programmatic Sediment Management Plan.  The main elements of the work are described below.<BR><BR>Assemble Supporting GIS Data for the Study Area.<BR> <BR>Essential data and reports will be compiled for the study area to support the evaluations performed for this project.  The sediment delivery area of the lower Snake River Basin is approximately 32,000 square miles.  The dominant land cover types in the study region are forestland, shrubland and grassland. According to the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset, approximately about 14 percent of the area, 4,400 square miles, is classified as agricultural land.  This investigation will assess sediment yield and evaluate the effectiveness of potential sediment reduction measures in the predominantly agricultural subbasins of the study region.  The agricultural subbasins include portions of watersheds of the lower Clearwater River, South Fork Clearwater River, Potlatch River, Palouse River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and Asotin Creek. The area to be considered is approximately 7,800 square miles.  The investigation will adopt a sample-based and engineering modeling approach to evaluate sediment delivery.  It is not feasible to evaluate sediment yield from all individual agricultural fields and streams reaches for this large study area in the time available for development of the PSMP Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).   <BR><BR>It is expected that the evaluation will use existing readily available geographic information system (GIS) datasets and other data that is currently available to researchers that are engaged in the analysis.  Metadata for the digital datasets will meet the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) standards. Extensive collection of new sediment yield field data is not authorized for this project.  Limited field data such as photographs and inspection notes is permitted when this is necessary to validate the assessment approach.   A database listing of the data used in the sediment yield assessment will be made available to the Corps.  At the Corps discretion, all or part of the data used in the analysis will be delivered to the Corps in digital format.<BR><BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<BR>Fingerprinting Sediment Sources using Neutron Activation Analysis, ICP-MS, and X-ray Fluorescence.<BR><BR>Sediment fingerprinting is the terminology used to identify the origin of sediment sources within a watershed by characterizing a number of diagnostic physical and chemical properties.  Sediment fingerprinting can be used to define sediment sources and transfers within drainage basins based on the assumptions that: 1, the potential catchment sediment sources can be distinguished on the basis of their physical, geochemical and biogenic properties or fingerprints; and 2, a relative comparison of the sediment fingerprints can be made with values obtained from the original source materials.  There are several possible alternative techniques that can be used to identify these properties, and the process should involve several different alternative diagnostic properties, rather than a single indicator, to establish the consistency of the results obtained.  The use of composite fingerprints in combination with a multivariate mixing model can then provide a basis for estimating the importance of individual catchment areas and specific source types.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) and or large businesses capable of assisting in the following Medicaid and CHIP research.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span> Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Medicaid is a State administered, Federal and State funded entitlement program which provides health care to the most vulnerable population in the US. Medicaid provides Medical assistance to almost 60 million individuals with payments in excess of $300 billion a year.<br /><br />The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the State Children's Health Insurance Program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. CHIP permits States to extend health coverage to uninsured children, and later some adults, through either a separate CHIP program, a Medicaid expansion, or a combination of both programs as of October 1, 1997. Like Medicaid, CHIP is State administered with Federal matching funds. Unlike Medicaid, which is a full entitlement program, CHIP dollars are capped. During FY 2008, 7.4 million children and 300,000 adults were served by CHIP. <br /><br />The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) was signed on Februrary 4, 2009, to extend the coverage that was due to expire and to expand coverage to millions of children who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage but are not enrolled. Unlike Medicaid, which is a full entitlement program, CHIP dollars are capped. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Programs:</span> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and CHIPRA of 2009 both include requirements upon which new federal policies will be based. Funding has been allotted to improve the services provided in the Medicaid and CHIP programs. State evaluations, statistical and policy analyses will be necessary resources for Federal Medicaid and CHIP policy makers to assist them in administering these programs and also for strategic planning purposes and to be accountable to the White House, Congress and other stakeholders. <br /><br />It will be critical for contractors to have knowledge of Medicaid and CHIP laws, regulations, and policies and an understanding of how States and the federal government relate to one another in the Medicaid and CHIP context. The Contractor should be versed in existing evaluations, State guidance materials including State Medicaid Director (SMD) and State Health Officer (SHO) letters, regulations and other policy related documents. CMS is seeking expertise in the following areas:<br /><br />1. Individual State Medicaid/CHIP programs and policies<br />2. The Medicaid Management Information System and the Medicaid Statistical Information System<br />3. Medicaid and CHIP providers<br />4. Medicaid and CHIP waiver history and the review and approval process<br />5. Managed care within the Medicaid and CHIP programs<br />6. Quality and performance measurement techniques<br />7. Care coordination strategies for dual eligibles and other chronically ill populations<br /><br />Contractors must have experience with Medicaid and CHIP programs. Contractors must document their experience and/or expertise in the following categories: <br /><br />1. Ability to survey State Medicaid and CHIP staff regarding State practices<br />2. Ability to identify, develop and recommend best practices that can be highlighted<br />3. Ability to understand CMS data and to analyze the statistical and program data<br />4. Ability to understand and analyze State policies and data<br />5. Ability to perform in depth policy analyses in a variety of areas, e.g., pharmacy, eligibility, claims, benefits<br />6. Ability to understand healthcare quality issues and payment reform<br />7. Ability to understand challenges, obstacles and issues related to meeting health information technology goals<br /><br />Staffing - The Contractor must have available staff with expertise in the following fields: <br /><br />&bull; Managing (or in depth understanding of the management of) a State Medicaid or CHIP program. <br />&bull; Legislative and policy expertise and experience determining policy implications for the Medicaid and/or CHIP programs. <br />&bull; The collection and analysis of State and/or Federal data to evaluate complex policy issues.<br />&bull; Experience supplying technical assistance to States or other large organizations that are involved in financing health care programs. <br />&bull; Understanding the opportunities and implications of HIT, as well as the issues and the barriers.<br />&bull; Existing professional relationships with State Medicaid and/or CHIP staff are preferable.<br />

<DESC>RECOVERY: The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a multi-analysis system to be used in energy research program of the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. The main purpose of the system is to enable a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of materials transformations at interfaces with extensive nanoscale structure such as used for photoanodes, supercapacitors, batteries electrodes, hydrogen storage materials and solar cells. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a multi-analysis system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order utilizing FAR Subpart 13.5.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Reinvestment Recovery Act funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for a multi-analysis system that would meet the following functional requirements:

The system consists of surface analysis chamber(s) connected to a glove box with a sample transfer mechanism. The setup should enable extensive analysis of chemical and electrochemical transformations of the interfaces that are carried out under conditions close to the real operating environment using analytical techniques that require high- or ultrahigh-vacuum conditions.

The surface analysis chamber(s) shall be equipped with the following analytical techniques: 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for measurement of surface morphology 
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for local determination of the material composition

<DESC>RECOVERY-This Notice includes updated information from a previous Notice, AMD-09-SS43, 
with a previous response date of July 10, 2009. All potential vendors are strongly encouraged and invited to respond to this updated Notice, including vendors who may have responded to the previous Notice. 

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing one or more parts of a high performance Time Scale and Distribution System to be used as part of NIST’s time and frequency measurement programs in the NIST Physics Laboratory. The principal purpose of the system is to provide stable and reliable time and frequency information for NIST measurements services, for coordination of international time and frequency standards, and to provide NIST customers with accurate and precise time and frequency measurements and related services. 

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for one or more parts of the system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for Time Scale and Distribution System that can meet the functional requirements outlined below, and which comprises two subsystems:
1. Frequency Standards and Measurement System.
2. Precision Time Distribution and Time Transfer System.

Potential vendors are encouraged to consider providing information about meeting NIST needs for any one or both of the subsystems. For example, a vendor may wish to consider providing information for a potential bid only on the Frequency Standards and Measurement System (component #1) or only on the Precision time Distribution and Time Transfer System (component #2). Or a vendor may wish to consider providing information on both components as a single procurement.

1. Frequency Standards and Measurement System

This system comprises a time scale of several high performance atomic frequency standards and a high performance measurement system to enable the production of a single weighted average time signal from the ensemble of frequency standards. 

The ensemble of frequency standards is expected to include:
• Approximately ten high performance, active cavity tuned hydrogen masers.
• Approximately eight high performance cesium beam standards. 

The measurement system is expected to include:
• Up to two Auxiliary Output Generators providing time and frequency offset signals compared to the hydrogen masers without significantly degrading maser performance.
• Up to two multi-channel measurement systems, each with at least 32 separate channels.

For all of the equipment, NIST requires the best possible performance, and a record from manufacturers of delivering products that meet or exceed advertised performance specifications for frequency stability and other critical characteristics.

2. Precision Time Distribution and Time Transfer System

This system comprises high performance electronic components and fiber optic components required to convert the output from the Frequency Standards and Measurement System (#1 above) into useful signals for precision distribution and transfer of NIST time and frequency information to various external customers and partners. The system is expected to include:

• Approximately 175 high performance 5 MHz distribution amplifiers.

• Approximately 42 high performance Pulse Per Second (PPS) Generators. 

• Approximately six high performance Pulse Distribution Amplifiers.

• Approximately 12 high performance Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver systems, with varying performance characteristics. The GNSS receiver systems must be able to lock on to GPS L1, GPS L2, GLONASS L1 C/A and GLONASS L2 signals. The receiver systems must provide stable time delays through the entire system. The systems must comprise antennas, cables, and control/analysis computers. The systems must output RINEX observation and navigation formatted data, according to RINEX standard 2.10.

• One new Ku-band Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) system.  This system consists of the antenna and waveguide feed, high power amplifier, low noise amplifier, up converter, down converter, SATRE compatible TWSTFT modem, and a weather proof enclosure to hold the major components and up and down converters in close proximity to the antenna. The system must be designed for very high group delay stability over time and for variations in environmental conditions.

• A complete compensated optical fiber link for radio-frequency transfer comprising a length of optical fiber with optoelectronic modules at each end enabling the modulation of the light by an RF signal and providing the means to compensate for unwanted phenomena including Doppler effects, optical fiber noise and thermal effects. Each physical link is unidirectional and at least 4 physical links will be implemented to ensure a minimum of two independent and fully-bidirectional connections between two buildings on the NIST campus in Boulder, CO, separated by a distance of a few hundred meters at most.

• Up to two 5 MHz Quartz Oscillators with outstanding short-term stability over the temperature range 0 C to 40 C.

• An ultrastable microwave source based on an erbium-fiber optical frequency comb, with two stabilization systems. One system phase-locks the carrier-envelope offset frequency to a suitable RF source, creating a “self-referenced” optical comb. The other one phase-locks one of the comb’s optical frequencies to a CW laser stabilized via a thermally-controlled and vibration insensitive, high-finesse optical cavity. The output of the cavity-stabilized, self-referenced optical frequency comb is a microwave signal whose frequency is an integer multiple of the repetition rate of the optical comb and whose short-term frequency stability is the one achieved by any optical frequency part of the comb, effectively creating an optical frequency divider.

It is unlikely that a single manufacturer can provide all the required equipment. Expressions of interest and technical capabilities are sought from potential vendors who can work with a range of original equipment suppliers to provide the required equipment described above.

For all of the equipment, NIST requires the best possible performance, and a record from manufacturers of delivering products that meet or exceed advertised performance specifications for frequency stability, minimal phase noise, and other critical characteristics.

Companies that provide systems responsive to NIST’s needs for one or more of the subsystems listed above are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV not later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  

The report must include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 
1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 
4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 
5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

Project Description and Scope 

As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government’s primary biomedical research agency.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  

The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.

The proposed project is the renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing, the project consists of two interrelated tasks.  Task A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14.

ARRA-funded Task B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14.  Task B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Task A.

The Design Documents for Tasks A and B are the responsibility of the architectural and engineering consulting firms currently under contract.  

NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for the Building 10 Renovation.


CMc Scope of Services  

The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing approved 100% construction documents. These 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to prepare their Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Pre-Construction and Construction Tasks.  

A single GMP will be required for both interrelated tasks (Task A, floors 2-5, and Task B, floors 6-13 and north corridor areas of floors 2-5).  Areas adjacent to the construction will be occupied throughout the renovation Tasks.

There may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items. 

At the completion of Task A, the Government will conduct an Activation /Occupancy Task to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing.  Portions of Task B may be concurrent with Task A, but Task B can only be completed following the Activation/Occupancy of Task A.  A similar Activation / Occupancy Task will occur at the completion of Task B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13.  The CMc shall coordinate its activities as required with the Government’s Occupancy Tasks.

<SUBJECT>4.0 Meter Fishbuster trawl doors
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-10-02723
<RESPDATE>120809
<CONTACT>Kevin J Buum, Contract Specialist, Phone 816-426-7461, Fax 816-274-6949, Email kevin.j.buum@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to purchase the following items from Nor'Eastern Trawl Systems (NET), Inc. located in Bainbridge Island, WA: 1 pair of 4.0 meter Fishbuster trawl doors with removable shoes. Fishbuster trawl doors have been identified by NMFS's Harvesting Systems specialists as the best candidates to properly control their trawl at the intended target depths and tow speeds. These trawl doors will be used for a 68 x 354 cm mid-water rope trawl. The doors are a vital component of a mid-water rope trawl system that hold the net open and &lsquo;fly' the trawl through the water column. This equipment is necessary for the conduct of a research cruise to be conducted aboard the NOAA ship Pisces during 20 January - 25 March 2010. This item is a proprietary design of NET Systems, Inc. and they are the only known source of supply. The proprietary design of NET Systems, Inc. meets the Government's technical needs and no other design will do the job as effectively. Because the Government does not have the manufacturer's drawings for this part, it would not be economical to attempt to re-procure this part as a "build-to-print." Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the item by part number. This item is being purchased for the NMFS, to be delivered to Pascagoula, MS.</p>
<p>Requirements and Specifications:<br />The combination of a trawl and trawl doors must work in harmony in order to achieve maximum efficiency for capturing large, highly mobile squids occupying water depths between 400-800 meters. Analysis of available studies indicate that effective fishing gears for these species must have a large mouth opening and must be able to be towed at a relatively high speed (4-5 knots) while maintaining control of trawl depth. The trawl doors are a vital component to an effective trawl system. Because these target species generally form discrete layers within the water column, it is also necessary that sufficient control can be exerted over the trawl while in the water to allow targeting of specific depths. As a trawl is towed through the water, it is the function of the trawl doors to open the net and maintain a depth according to the trawl speed.</p>
<p>The vendor must meet the following requirements:<br />1) The design experience and physical capacity to construct trawl doors of this type.<br />2) The vendor must coordinate with the Harvesting Systems branch at the SEFSC Pascagoula laboratory in order to ensure that the trawl doors meet the necessary specifications.<br />3) The vendor must deliver the trawl doors to the NMFS, SEFSC Pascagoula laboratory.</p>
<p>The intended procurement is for supplies which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). However, all proposals received prior to the close of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to NET Systems, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product. Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified trawl doors or trawl doors that provide the same fit, form and function as that specified. Any responses that provide for parts other than that specified must be accompanied by descriptive literature and certified test results that show it meets the same form, fit and function of the item number specified (Item Number: DSFB040). Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address kevin.j.buum@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6949 ATTN: Kevin Buum. The NAICS code for this requirement is 314999.

<ARCHDATE>12082009
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>DESC: The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), and National Marine Fisheries Service, in Miami, FL., intend to procure a Mid-Water Trawl<br />from Trawlworks, Inc. The mid-water rope trawl will be used during scientific research conducted by NOAA fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Center on the prey of the endangered Sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico. The research trawl must be delivered to the SEFSC Pascagoula laboratory by January 7, 2010 to allow time for assembly and deployment aboard the NOAA vessel Pisces. <br />Specifications: The mid-water rope trawl must be an effective gear for capturing large, highly mobile squids occupying water depths between 400-800 m. Analysis of available studies indicate that effective fishing gears for these species must have a large mouth opening and must be able to be towed at a relatively high speed (4-5 knots). Because these target species generally form discrete layers within the water column, it is also necessary that sufficient control can be exerted over the trawl while in the water to allow targeting of specific depths. The net design selected for this project is determined by the government to be the best available to achieve the goals.
<p>Specifically, the net is a 68x354 cm mid-water rope trawl made from various sized tenex rope (or similar material) and twisted nylon mesh. Detailed design specifications and diagrams can be provided upon request.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>The net vendor must meet the following requirements:<br />1) The experience and capacity to construct a trawl of this type. Experience with net designs similar to this one is required.</p>
<p>2) The vendor must be able to meet a delivery time of 10 weeks or less once the order is received.<br />3) The vendor must deliver the trawl to the NMFS, SEFSC Pascagoula laboratory.</p>
<p>The research cruise is to be conducted on January 20, thru March 25, 2010. This is a highly specialized piece of sampling gear to construct. The intended procurement is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source Trawlworks, Inc. Trawlworks, Inc. is the only know vendor that is able to meet the governments required deadline. Interested firms should submit in writing, their name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding their capability and qualifications to provide this product and within the required timeframe. <br />Any business capable of providing this service is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 7 calendar days after publication of this notice. This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 339999. Size standard not to exceed 500 employees. This service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12 Commercial Items. The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry. NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. The government now requires all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at www.bpn.gov. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in CCR and BPN. Responses should be faxed to 816-426-7530. Attn: Sharon Walker.</p>

<DESC>University Affiliation for Medical Laboratory Technician<BR>The MEDCOM Health Care Acquisition Activity, Center for Health Care Contracting, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The government is conducting a market research for any University or College that offers a National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) accredited Certificate Program in Medical Laboratory Technology, and an Associate Degree in Medical Laboratory technology, that provides enrollment services and academic records maintenance for each student enrolled in the Medical Laboratory Technician Program [311-68K10].  The 311-68K10 referred to herein as the Program, is 60 semester hours in length and is taught by Government personnel under the supervision of the Course Director at the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDDC&S), Fort Sam Houston Texas.  The Program consists of two 26-week Phases:  40 semester hours studies conducted at the AMEDDC&S, Fort Sam Houston, TX, and 20 semester hours of clinical training conducted at any of the 21 US Army Medical Department Activity Phase 2 training sites. Total program length is 52 weeks. The clinical training will be performed under the supervision of qualified clinical instructors appointed by the Government.  The Government will enroll at least 30 students per class, no more than 500 students annually into the Program but no more than 1,500 students over the contract period to include option years. Upon student completion of the 311-68K10 Program, the college or university will issue an official transcript for each student. All college credit hours granted will be based solely on the curriculum defined in the Program of Instruction (POI) for Army Course 311-68K10. NOTE:  The 311-68K10 Program will not be in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA 88), or the DOD Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program of 1997 (CLIP) if any college or university does not offer a 60 Semester Hour Certificate Program as well as an Associate Degree Program.  Non-compliance with CLIA 88 or CLIP would result in the loss of NAACLS accreditation, and would render our students ineligible to perform complex laboratory testing, or to challenge a National Certification Exam for Medical Laboratory Technicians.

To the best of our knowledge, Oral Surgery Associates is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-5036. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT. 
<p>Any responses to this Request for Information (RFI) should be submitted by 12:00 PM EST, December 21, 2009.</p>
<p>This notice consists of four parts:</p>
<p>PART I. INTRODUCTION<br />PART II. BACKGROUND<br />PART III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT <br />PART IV. HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals").</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>
<p>These referenced documents may be accessed electronically at the OFPP website located at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/</a>. Please frame any responses to this notice in accordance with the policies contained in these references.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customer Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides information technology (IT) services and products that enable ICE and DHS to meet their respective missions and to protect and secure our nation. In order to meet these goals, the OCIO has developed a number of critical IT initiatives that will help ICE modernize its IT systems, adapt and conform to modern IT management disciplines, and provide IT solutions throughout ICE. For additional information on ICE's mission see: http://www.ice.gov/about/index.htm</p>
<p>Because of the lack of precise specifications and difficulties in estimating costs with accuracy, ICE OCIO has historically used cost-reimbursement contracts when contracting for software development of IT systems. The cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract type is commonly used in software development contracts. CPFF contracts do not contain performance incentives based on the quality, timeliness, cost, or other elements of the work performed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to request information from interested parties, including potential Offerors, about the feasibility of alternative contract arrangements for software development, including:</p>
<p>&bull; The use of Performance-Based contracting <br />&bull; The structure and administration of contract incentives<br />&bull; The use of various contract types for software development projects, including Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF)</p>
<p>III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT</p>
<p>Information and comments are solicited regarding the following Discussion Areas:</p>
<p>Discussion Area 1: Performance-Based Contracting</p>
<p>1.1 Is there interest in Performance-Based contract arrangements for software development?</p>
<p>1.2 What benefits, problems and/or risks might exist in utilizing Performance-Based contracting techniques in the IT and software development arenas?</p>
<p>1.3 Do the benefits of motivating contractor performance with performance incentives outweigh the administrative costs and time burden to the Government and the Contractor?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 2: Measuring Performance</p>
<p>2.1 What are the key elements of the process of software development that are critical to successful outcomes and results?</p>
<p>2.2 What performance requirements, e.g., tasks and deliverables, are susceptible to measurement?</p>
<p>2.3 What standards can or should be used to measure unsatisfactory, satisfactory, and outstanding achievement of the performance requirements identified? What are the best sources of performance standards?</p>
<p>2.4 Should standards be expressed in terms of technical performance (quality), timeliness (schedule), cost control, or some combination of these parameters?</p>
<p>2.5 What surveillance and measurement techniques can or should be used to determine whether the standards are not achieved, achieved, or exceeded?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 3: Incentives and Contract Type</p>
<p>3.1 What types of incentives may be appropriate for use in software development efforts to motivate the contractor to meet and exceed the standards identified in Discussion Area (2)?</p>
<p>3.2 FAR Subpart 16.4 discusses two basic categories of incentive contracts, the fixed-price incentive contracts and the cost-reimbursement incentive contracts. Fixed-price incentive contract types include the fixed-price incentive (FPI) contract and the fixed-price with award fee (FPAF) contract. Cost-reimbursement incentive contract types include the cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract and the cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract. These four contract types focus largely on fee-based monetary incentives, and thus would have potential applicability and interest to the software development community currently working under cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) arrangements. Is there interest in any of these arrangements? If so, under what circumstances and how should the incentives be structured and administered? If not, why not?</p>
<p>3.3 What performance incentives using a mechanism other than fee would be feasible and would they be of interest to the IT community? Please discuss and comment on the award of additional periods of contract performance (known as "award term" contracts). <br /><br />3.4 Have software development projects been implemented successfully in a FFP, and/or CPIF/CPAF environment? If so, please explain. If possible, please provide samples.</p>
<p>3.5 What, if any, impact would the inclusion of performance incentives, FFP contract types, or other contract arrangements in future ICE software development contracts have on the decision to submit an offer?</p>
<p>3.6 Please discuss the possibility of breaking a Software Development project up into modules that could be priced as CPIF or CPAF for the initial phases, and transitioning to FFP as the "unknowns" become "knowns."</p>
<p>3.7 Please discuss problems that might be encountered utilizing any of the methods discussed, and provide suggested solutions or alternatives.</p>
<p>Discussion Area 4: Other</p>
<p>4.1 If you have Federal Government Points of Contact that have implemented a successful software development project using FFP, contract incentives, and/or performance-based contracting, we'd appreciate it if you'd share their contact information with us.</p>
<p>4.2 Would the IT community benefit from a public meeting to discuss the information submitted in response to this notice?</p>
<p>IV. HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>Please direct any questions concerning this notice to Ms. Miranda Collins at Miranda.Collins@dhs.gov, or 202-732-2549.</p>
<p>Please submit your information and comments, whether supportive or critical, to the Contracting Specialist electronically no later than December 21, 2009. Please submit the replies electronically to Miranda.Collins@dhs.gov. Electronic submissions should be submitted as an e-mail attachment in Microsoft Word. Please repeat each Discussion Area with questions and provide the response beneath. Please submit the information in the same order and using the same numbering scheme in this notice to facilitate evaluation and organization by Government reviewers. Please limit responses to 50 pages.</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The use of information received in response to this notice may be used by ICE for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. ICE will not critique the responses to this notice and the notice should not be used by Offerors to market their products/services. ICE does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with responding to this RFI. Proprietary information is neither sought nor desired by ICE. If such information is submitted, it must clearly be marked "proprietary" on every sheet containing such information, and the proprietary information must be segregated to the maximum extent practicable from other portions of the response (e.g., use an attachment or exhibit).</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-10-AA01 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is a small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 111421, business size is $0.75 million.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37.

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has a need for Nursery grown Arunda donax plants.  The USDA laboratory requires delivery of 7,800 plants over a 11 ½  week period with the option to increase the quantity by an additional 7,800 plants over a 11 ½ week period for a total of 15,600 plants over 23 weeks.

The following will detail the specific requirements.  Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S.  Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; catastrophic stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users.  Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species.  USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.  Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program.  1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants. 2) Contractor will provide weekly deliveries (every Monday and Thursday) of 600, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants. 3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants that are topped at 3 feet and held for 3 additional weeks for formation of side shoots at least 3 nodes. 75 of the 675 plants will have a single stem at least 1 inch in thickness at the soil level and no more than 12 inches tall.  These single stem plants are used only for rearing the Arundo fly. 4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any insecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval.) 5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) that are mechanically field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. 6) Plants must be grown in native LRGV sandy loam soil or soil mix as specified by USDA. 7) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops.  Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter. 8) Plants may need to be fertilized with urea fertilizer as required by USDA. 9) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 week from field harvest. 10) Contractor will deliver plants to greenhouse facilities at USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N. Moorefield Rd., Edinburg, TX 78541. 11) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with one month of prior notice. 12) USDA reserves the right to increase the number of plants delivered each week with advance notice to the grower.  Advance notice will account for the time it takes for the grower to dig and grow the optimum plant. 13) Period of the performance is 11 ½ weeks beginning January 4, 2010 and extending an additional 11 ½ weeks if option is exercised.  Please price the base and option as separate line items.   Price to include delivery to the USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N Moorefield Road, Edinburg, Texas 78541.  Each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.  Acceptance and FOB point are destination.  In order to be considered for award offerors shall provide a quotation on company letterhead and include with the bid schedule detailing the unit pricing and references for the proposed item.  References must have received the proposed item within the last three calendar years (Government references preferred but will accept commercial references) shall also be provided for the item quoted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with a size standard of $25 Million. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a total small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 511210. This requirement is being competed as an unrestricted full and open competition.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:</p>
<p>The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including the following fill-ins: 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p><br />Under a directive from the U.S. Department of Commerce the National Institute of Standards and Technology has adopted a password policy that all users and administrators must follow. The Password Manager software was used to implement this policy. The current Password Manager Annual Support/Maintenance for 7,000 user licenses will expire on December 30, 2009 and will need to be renewed. This is a competitive procurement for the annual support/maintenance for the Password Manager user licenses currently employed at NIST. All quotes that are submitted shall give pricing information for the following item:</p>
<p>Line Item No. 0001<br />Password Manager Annual Support/Maintenance 7,000 users<br />Period of Performance: December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010<br />Annual maintenance includes:<br />&bull; Unlimited technical support via email, telephone, fax and secure remote VPN, if such access is provided by NIST, during regular hours; 13 hours per day, 5 days per week (Monday to Friday 7 am to 8 pm EST).<br />&bull; All major and minor updates and upgrades to Hitachi ID Password Manager should be included in the maintenance contract, so NIST does not have to purchase upgrade products.<br /><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is required by the U.S. Department of Commerce to implement the current password policy, which utilizes the Password Manager software. Implementing new software, other than Password Manager, in order to continue the current password policy would result in greater costs to the Federal Government than it would to renew the services. Also, the impact of switching to different software would have a negative impact on NIST in terms of time, the learning curve, and costs.</p>
<p>The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this acquisition:<br />1194.21<br />1194.31<br />1194.41</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are Hitachi ID Systems authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>(a) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate all quotes:<BR><BR>Factor I - Technical.  The vendors quote shall show compliance with the four salient characteristics in the table below:<BR><BR>Salient Characteristics	Standard	Standard<BR>	Acceptable	Unacceptable<BR>1.  Offered table must be 220V/50Hz		<BR>2.  Offered table must have heated upholstery/seat and lumbar and heated drawer		<BR> 3.

If the offeror failed to price all CLINs, the quote will not be considered for award. <BR>EVALUATION STANDARDS.  The offerors technical quote will be evaluated using the following standards for a final rating:<BR>ACCEPTABLE:  A quote that satisfies all of the Governments requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>UNACCEPTABLE:  A quote that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the quote.<BR>(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR>(End of provision)<BR><BR> SPECIAL NOTE: All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award, and lack of registration shall make an offer ineligible for award.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>The following amendment Two(2) is to correct amendment one (1) information:

1) Question: The specs for the Compute Node requests for the chassis to be a 1U rackmount and 2 compute nodes within each rackmount.  So if you’re requesting (4) 1U rackmounts, then you’re looking to have (8) compute nodes correct?

NIST response:  No, NIST is looking for 4 compute nodes in 2 1U rackmounts

2) Questions:  Each 1U rackmount will have (2) Quad-Core Xeon CPU’s, which means one CPU per node correct?

NIST Response: Each 1U rackmount will have 2 nodes.  Each node will have 2 Quad-Core Xeon CPUs, so 2 CPUs per node.  So that’s 2 (1U rackmounts) x 2 (nodes per 1U rackmount) x 2 (Quad-Core Xeon CPUs per node) x 4 (cores per CPU) = 32 (cores). Adding the head unit makes 36 (cores).

<DESC>The following amendment three(3) is to clarify the following information: 

IF you are going to use the RAID 5 specified in the requirements, do you need the Hardware Controller to be capable of Raid 3?
 
NIST Response: RAID 0, 1, 5, 6 and JBOD are required.


Can you please let me know what versions of the software listed in section 4
are needed for the cluster?

NIST Response: Most recent stable versions.

Question:  The specs for the computer nodes request a software RAID configuration for the hard drives with 4 RAID stripes but the drives sizes requested is not clear.  It asks for a 10GB, 25GB, and 300GB.  Then it is followed by requesting (2) 300GB 10k rpm.  Im not clear exactly what size drives are needed and how many as the industry does not produce any 10gb or 25gb drive sizes.

NIST Response: Each of the four compute nodes will have two physical drives (two 300GB 10K RPM drives).  The software RAID must be configured so that all four stripes exist on each physical drive.  The two RAID 1 stripes will be mirrored across the two drives. The two RAID 0 stripes will be segmented symmetrically across the two drives.

(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:		Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

Project Description and Scope 

As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government’s primary biomedical research agency.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  

The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.

The proposed project is the renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing, the project consists of two interrelated tasks.  Task A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14.

ARRA-funded Task B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14.  Task B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Task A.

The Design Documents for Tasks A and B are the responsibility of the architectural and engineering consulting firms currently under contract.  

NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for the Building 10 Renovation.


CMc Scope of Services  

The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing approved 100% construction documents. These 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to prepare their Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Pre-Construction and Construction Tasks.  

A single GMP will be required for both interrelated tasks (Task A, floors 2-5, and Task B, floors 6-13 and north corridor areas of floors 2-5).  Areas adjacent to the construction will be occupied throughout the renovation Tasks.

There may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items. 

At the completion of Task A, the Government will conduct an Activation /Occupancy Task to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing.  Portions of Task B may be concurrent with Task A, but Task B can only be completed following the Activation/Occupancy of Task A.  A similar Activation / Occupancy Task will occur at the completion of Task B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13.  The CMc shall coordinate its activities as required with the Government’s Occupancy Tasks.

NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for the Building 10 Renovation.

CMc Scope of Services 

The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing approved 100% construction documents.  These 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to prepare their Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Pre-Construction and Construction Tasks. 

A single GMP will be required for both interrelated tasks (Task A, floors 2-5, and Task B, floors 6-13 and north corridor areas of floors 2-5). Areas adjacent to the construction will be occupied throughout the renovation Tasks.

There may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items. 

At the completion of Task A, the Government will conduct an Activation /Occupancy Task to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing. Portions of Task B may be concurrent with Task A, but Task B can only be completed following the Activation/Occupancy of Task A. A similar Activation / Occupancy Task will occur at the completion of Task B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13. The CMc shall coordinate its activities as required with the Government’s Occupancy Tasks.

The CMc shall not interrupt any of the NIH Governmental activities in the performance of his work, including the adjacent occupied hospital and biomedical research areas within Building 10 which will remain operational, throughout the construction process.

For example, 
In the adjacent wing of Building 10 on the second floor sensitive surgeries will be conducted in Operating Rooms with utility and Joint Commission accreditation requirements, which shall be addressed and supported at all times.  

On the 11th floor F Wing BSL 2 infectious disease research with controlled select agents will continue to be conducted throughout the first phase of the project.  Loss of control of the directional air flow, interruption of the lab vacuum system, or loss of electrical power could lead to the contamination of those working with these samples and those in adjacent spaces.  

During the second phase of the project, autopsies and critical analysis of patient pathology samples will be evaluated on the second and third floors of the F Wing.  These spaces will be connected to the new utility systems which are under renovation for the upper floors.  Loss of utilities could lead to misdiagnosis of critical surgical, patient pathology specimens.  

Main computer connections, which are located below the construction area in the F Wing, are critical to allow Doctors to retrieve patient data from the Clinical Data Center and to place orders for the treatment of patients.  If this utility were lost, patients’ lives would be endangered.

The project is located on the Crow Creek Sioux Indian Reservation at Stephan (Hyde County), South Dakota (Stephan, SD is approximately 50 miles east of Pierre, SD).
The original Presolicitiation notice contained an incorrect response deadline, to wit, "All Design-Build (D-B) firms have until 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), January 30, 2010 [sic]...." 
The correct response deadline is 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), January 7, 2010.
The original Presolicitation notice stated, "A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals and a sub-contracting plan - large business contractors will be expected to subcontract at least 25% of the award total to small business."
As a clarification, this sentence now reads, "A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals and a sub-contracting plan, which will include addressing the Indian Preference Requirements - large business contractors will be expected to subcontract at least 25% of the award total to small business."

This sources-sought synopsis is issued in anticipation of a future procurement program. Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine contractor interest and capability to produce a new product called the Countermeasure, Anti-Torpedo (CAT). The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and its associated All Up Round Equipment (AURE). 
ATT is being developed by Applied Research Laboratory, Penn State University (ARL PSU) and Naval Surface Warfare Command, Indian Head Division (NSWC IHD). The AURE is being developed by Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport Division and SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego. The development includes generation of technical data that will allow potential production contractors to bid a "build to print" design or be offered as GFI to a production contract with an associated performance specification. 
The ATT is divided into five Major Modules: Nose: The Nose includes an acoustic array and array processing; Warhead: The Warhead includes safe and arm electronics; Guidance and Control: Command and Control includes electronics, INS and the thermal battery; Power Plant: The Power Plant includes a lithium based Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS) Engine, reduction gear, a number of Electro-Explosive Devices for Engine start up and propulsion electronics; Tail Section: The Tail Section contains control surfaces, Propulsor and electronics for interface to the ship's weapon system. There are two propulsion systems and two warhead variants planned. The primary variants will be for the production system as described above, and a smaller quantity of exercise variants of each will be produced. The propulsion system for the exercise variant will be replaced with an electric/battery motor, and the warhead will be replaced with an electronics package. The objective of this new development is to field a hard kill countermeasure for surface ship torpedo defense. The future procurement may result in the award of a single prime contract at the CAT level or multiple contracts at the major module levels described above. If multiple contracts are awarded at the major module level, government acceptance testing would be required at the module level. Final integration with the other modules would be performed at the contractor's facility, a government owned facility that is contractor operated (GOCO) or a government owned and operated facility (GOGO). 
The tactical warhead production is planned to be at NSWC IHD and will be supplied to the integrator as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Part of the 'build to print' technical design work for the ATT is to provide built-in-test and test equipment for both the major module level and CAT level to allow sell off at either level, as well as final test at the CAT level. It also allows for life cycle support of the weapon. The Government Furnished Information (GFI) for the test equipment will be included in the Technical Data Package for either a single contractor or multiple contractors at the major module level. 
The ATT software is being developed and will be maintained by ARL PSU. Configuration management of the "build to print" modules/system will be jointly maintained by the contractor(s) and government (via ARL PSU). Engineering Development Models and Prototypes will not be part of the production contractor(s) responsibility. The development of the EDM will include engineering changes during development to reflect correction of issues found during environmental testing, insensitive munitions testing and the in water test program. The last EDM built by ARL PSU is planned to be identical to the technical data package issued for LRIP. 
The scope of this potential program currently is approximately 110 ATT LRIP units and 1500 Production units. The second phase of this program is in the planning stages which may double the number of production units. The government is also looking at other applications for the ATT which may expand its market further. No FMS sales are anticipated at this time. 
Interested firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary that does not exceed five (5) pages in length describing Production capability and their experience with similar items. The capability summary should explicitly state if they are interested in the single prime production contractor role or the major module level prime production role. 
Contractors interested in becoming a single prime contractor for the CAT should discuss their strategies for teaming with subcontractors and successes that have been achieved in this area for similar contract actions. Contractors interested in single major module production or multiple major module production should explicitly state which areas they are interested in manufacturing and focus their discussion on their capability to build these modules. The discussion should include recent relevant business experience and their planned approach to meet the requirements stated above. Specifically, firms should discuss their past success with "Build to Print" contracts and relevant experience where higher level integration is required after delivery of their assemblies. If the contractor has experience with similar systems that were not "build to print", inclusion of this information in the report is also desired. 
Responses should include: 
(a) The name and address of the contractor and where the CAT would be built; (b) Point of contact including name, title, phone, and email addresses; (c) A description of similar or like complexity devices currently offered by the contractor that meet, or with minor modifications might meet, some or all the listed requirements. 
Where to submit: Email responses or inquiries should be sent to Rana Movahed. To help ensure proper receipt, please place the word"CAT" in the subject field of your e-mail correspondence. Information may also be sent to the following address: Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attention Rana Movahed Code 02622M 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE Stop 2050, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2050. No telephone inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not be honored, as a solicitation is not prepared at this time. When to Submit: Responses are requested by 25 November 2009. 
Notice Regarding Solicitation: Please note that this synopsis is for information purposes and to identify potential sources only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Notice Regarding Proprietary Information: All submitted materials will be designated for Government Use Only. Other: No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow up information requests.

The current contractor performing the required services is Censeo Consulting Group; 1331 H Street, NW; Suite 600; Washington, D.C. 20005.
Background:  The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) and the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk (FISCN) are engaged in efforts to streamline and rationalize contract requirements for selected commodities and services throughout the Department of the Navy.  These efforts are collectively known as Strategic Sourcing.  The Government defines Strategic Sourcing as "...the collaborative and structured process of critically analyzing an organization's spending and using this information to make business decisions about acquiring commodities and services more effectively and efficiently."  In particular, the team is currently evaluating sourcing opportunities within diverse areas such as furniture acquisition; program management support; and logistics support services, as well as other supplies and services.  The Government is potentially seeking contractor support to assist in these efforts.
Request for Information:  This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) only and "NOT" a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or services. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government.

The Statement of Capability (SOC) will determine the feasibility and/or basis for the Navy's decision to establish this requirement as a competitive 8(a) program participant acquisition.

<DESC>Request For Information # 2

QUESTION # 1:
Does the 20% have to be businesses who are located permanently in San Juan?
What does "GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: 20% in Puerto Rico" mean? Does it mean that 20% of the design has to be performed by Architectural and/or Engineering firms established in Puerto Rico? 


ANSWER: YES, THE BUSINESSES MUST BE LOCATED IN PUERTO RICO. 
Yes, A/E firms are advised that at least 20% of the level of contract effort must be performed in Puerto Rico in which the project is located. 


QUESTION # 2:
In responding to the evaluation criteria for this solicitation, it occurs to me that some clarification may be helpful.  For evaluation criteria 1 and 3, Past Performance on Design and Lead Designer Portfolio respectively, the solicitation mentions projects completed in the last ten years. Does this refer to completion of design or completion of construction?

ANSWER: CONSTRUCTION.  

QUESTION # 3:
The solicitation states “358 structured parking 399 surface parking spaces”  which could be very problematic if a LEED-NC Gold level certification is desired. Is this a requirement that could be altered during design?

ANSWER: The number of parking spaces for the FBI complex is 358.  The remaining 399 surface spaces is for the existing Degetau Federal Building.   
The parking requirements can not be changed.

<DESC>VA241-10-RQ-0096 Amendment 1The following questions were presented by a vendor.Can you give me an idea to the potential need for the AN physician?I know there are no guarantees and we'll know the schedule one week in advance.However, I am trying to determine the "need" so the MD's will have an idea if they need to commit to this VA ongoing or for short terms?Do you believe it would be 40hr per week ongoing? Or just a few hours here and there to fill in for needs due to absent providers, etc?This is the answer provided by my using Service.The potential need would be if a staff member may need some type of sick leave.The commitment would need to be long  term but depending upon staffing shortage, example is someone is going to be out on Maternity leave.  Sudden illness or family care.  I don't foresee a 40hour work week. I would safely say a few days randomly

<DESC><p>The research and development effort associated with this contract award is to advance state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge associated with high efficiency solar modules. The photovoltaic research goals for this contract award are to achieve a 25% (threshold) and 40% (objective) efficiency at a TRL 7 or greater level within the program time line of one year. The resultant contract type is a cost plus fixed fee, completion form contract. The basis for selection of this contract type is predicated upon the complexities of the scientific and technological efforts that must be sought to exploit breakthroughs in photovoltaic (solar) cells leading to greater improvement in their efficiency and reduction in solar panel size. The uniqueness and performance risk associated with the research to be accomplished further substantiate the rationale supporting the award of a cost plus fixed fee completion type contract.</p>

The research and development effort will focus on developing a small, rugged, lightweight portable Balance of System (BOS)/microgird to provide a versatile and reliable source of electrical power without adding excessive weight to the Soldiers load.  The microgrid system will be suitable for use with portable flexible solar panels and typical soldier-carried rechargeable BB2590/BB390 batteries.  A combined battery charger/AC module will be developed that a Soldier can carry and utilize the output from various power sources in order to generate a low power 120VAC output (~200W).  Additionally, a battery cradle will be development that holds multiple batteries and is capable of generating a higher output level of ACO power (~1KW).  The period of performance will be for twelve months commencing on December 15, 2009 through December 24, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the needed resources can not be fully determined prior to starting the work because conditions are different at each lock.  2)  The contractor is already responsible for maintaining and repairing the existing controls and operating equipment at these locks.  3)  The required work could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Since this contractor is already working on the controls at these sites, they have necessary equipment and expertise on site.  4)  This contract enables work to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

TRAINING:	The contractor is required to have employees trained in the courier requirements 	of transporting lab specimens and/or potentially infectious specimens in 	appropriate safety and packaging 	procedures suitable to specimen type and 	distances transported. Documentation of certified training for all personnel 	involved in the packaging and shipping of infectious material will be provided to 	the George E. Wahlen VA Salt Lake City Health Care System before the 	contractor begins working on the contract.	Is there documented certified training of all personnel involved in the 	packaging and shipping of 	infectious materials?		NOTE: Federal and international regulations mandate the proper packaging and 	transportation of infectious substances, also termed "etiologic agents." Infectious 	materials are now classified into two 	categories, category A (referred to as 	"infectious substances") and category B (referred to as "biologic substances, 	Category B"). Category A substances are capable of causing permanent 	disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or 	animals when exposure occurs. Category B substances are not in a form generally 	capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in 	otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure occurs. Several 	examples of category A substances include organisms such as Brucella abortus 	(cultures only), Ebola virus, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (cultures only). Most 	laboratory specimens fall under category B. Refer to the references below for 	further information. Specific requirements are set forth by 	the U.S. Public Health 	Service, the U.S. International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the U.S. 	Department of Transportation and the U.S. Postal Service. These apply to 	domestic transportation by land, air or sea, and to international air transportation. 	All personnel who package specimens for shipment must satisfactorily complete 	certified training in these requirements. Certified training is required every 2 	years. The laboratory may send personnel to courses for certified training, or may 	obtain materials to train its personnel in-house. Resources for certified training are 	available from many sources, including state health departments, vendors of 	shipping materials, and the CDC National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN).	The following is the NLTN website for training.	https://www.aphlnet.org/eweb/Dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=EventInfo&evt_key	=67d6f813-98b8-42e0-929e-eb6166590873		Another source is the following from SafTPack Medical.	http://www.saftpak.com/stpcdrom.asp	When transporting specimens, the laboratory requires specimens be placed into a 	cooler or carrier (with an ice pack) that has been properly marked for transporting 	biologic specimens and secured during transport.  I had spoken to the driver and 	asked what was to be used and he did not have a response other than he would 	hand carry any specimens. 		All specimens shall be properly packaged and labeled to indicate the general 	nature of the materials being transported. All specimen packages shall be packed 	in a container secured to the vehicle body to prevent movement during transport.       	Laboratory specimens are to be transported in accordance to temperature 	requirements. Room 	temperature specimens will be transported inside a cooler 	and must remain at a temperature from 22C to 25C during transport. 	Refrigerated specimens will be transported inside a cooler packed 	with regular 	ice and must remain at a temperature from 2C to 10C during transport. Frozen 	specimens will be transported inside a cooler packed with dry ice and must 	remain at a temperature for -15C to -20C during transport.2.   ID BADGE REQUIREMENTS	As per Information Letter 90-01-6, Contractor Personnel Security Requirements. 	All contractors, subcontractors and their employees will be required to provide 	two (2) forms of personal identification (list of acceptable ID is attached), fill out 	a Declaration of Federal Employment OF 306, be fingerprinted and badge prior to 	starting work at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. The prime contractor 	shall submit a list of every individual that will be working on the VA campus and 	a copy of their Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9	If the individual will have access to VA patient records or computer system, in 	addition the steps above, they will be required to fill out a Questionnaire for Non-	Sensitive Position, Standard Form 85. This form is very extensive and the 	individual will require approximately 1-2 hours for completion. This form can be 	done PRIOR to reporting to Building 4.	There are two mandatory training classes; Providing a Safe and Secure 	Environment for Health Care and Information Security and HIPAA (Privacy Act), 	that will be required for each individual, also. These can be accessed at 	www.uchep.com  Please allow approximately 1 hour to complete the two 	modules. You will need to complete these two courses and print out the 	certificates of completion PRIOR to coming to the VA for the ID Badge.	Each individual will be required to clear the VA and turn in their badge once the 	job is completed or they are no longer working at the VA. Final payment will be 	held until all paperwork and badges have been turned in. If a badge is lost, there 	will be a charge of $50 for each badge that will be deducted form the final 	payment.3.	PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY:	The contractor shall ensure the confidentiality of all patient information being 	transported and will be held liable in the event of breach of confidentiality. The 	contractor shall comply with the provisions of the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 	(Public Law 93-579), the comprehensive Alcohol 	Abuse and Alcoholism 	Prevention, treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1972 (Public Law 93-282), and 	the Drug Abuse Office treatment Act of 1972 (Public Law 93-255), and any other 	statutes regarding confidentiality of patient information.4.	PERSONNEL:	The contractor is responsible for providing a fully qualified on-site Contract 	Manager. The 	Contract Manager shall be responsible for management and 	coordination of the contract and shall be the point of contact with all government 	representatives. The contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing prior 	to contract start date the names of the Contract Manager and an alternate Contract 	Manager.	The Contract Manager shall be available for the government to reach during 	normal business hours. The Contract Manager shall respond within one business 	day from the time of notification. During non-business hours, the Contract 	Manager shall respond within one business day.
