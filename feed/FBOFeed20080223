<DESC>JECP Family of Systems are intended to collectively protect Joint expeditionary forces against chemical, biological, radiological (CBR) / toxic industrial material (TIM) contaminated environments. JECP tent kits and structure kits are intended to pro vide a versatile, transportable capability to convert common structures and tentage into a collective protection (ColPro) system.  JECP standalone shelter systems are intended to be self-contained (i.e., shall not require other supporting systems or compon ents such as tentage, building, structure or vehicle, etc.) and available in multiple sizes/configurations to meet various mission requirements.   JECP systems will be adapted in remote locations and harsh environments where sustainment/support is challeng ing, and fixed-site ColPro is limited or non-existent.  JECP systems will allow personnel to continue to perform command and control, medical, and rest and relief missions at near normal operations tempo without being encumbered by individual CBR protectiv e equipment.  JECP systems will integrate with existing electrical power and heating-cooling where available and support common functions associated with operational missions, such as sanitation, eating-drinking, floor-space, entry/exit, contamination cont rol, etc.  JECP systems will provide flexibility by reducing the need to deploy, move, and maintain large, heavy and complex ColPro systems.
