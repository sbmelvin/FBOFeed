<DESC>Contract Extension SYNOPSIS: NOTICE OF INTENTThe U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Savannah River Operations Office(SR),intends to extend the current security services contract with WackenhutServices, Incorporated (WSI)  Savannah River Site (SRS) for a base periodofnine months with one three month option and three one-month option periods.The present contract with WSI ends on September 30, 2008.  This proposedextension will enable the Department to continue its vital mission at SRSduring the evaluation and award of the Security Services competitiveacquisition.The extension of the WSI contract is necessary to allow the time requiredtoadequately foster full and open competition for a follow-on contract awardforthis multifaceted requirement.  This extension is required to provideuninterrupted security services while the competitive procurement iscompletedand successful contract transition is achieved.  DOE intends to extend theexisting contract with WSI-SRS for nine months with one three month optionandthree one-month option periods effective October 1, 2008, through December31,2009, including all options.The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion found at FederalAcquisitionRegulation 6.302-1 and 41 United State Code 253(c)(1), which authorizesotherthan full and open competition when there is only one responsible sourceand noother supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within thelimitedtime frame.  To DOEs knowledge, only WSI has the requisite knowledge,experience and capability to provide these critical, highly specializedservices without interruption during the acquisition cycle for a follow-oncontract.THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.Interested, responsible sources may submit information about theircapabilityto perform this requirement, which shall be considered by DOE for thepurposeof determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition fortheseinterim services.  Responses to this synopsis must be received via theDOEsIndustry Interactive Procurement System by 4:00 pm EST on June 23, 2008 tobeconsidered.
