<SUBJECT>99--Proposed Ceiling Increase to Contract DTFA01-98-C-00043
<SOLNBR>3512
<RESPDATE>030504
<ARCHDATE>04042004
<CONTACT>Tim Eckert, 202-385-8454
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to increase the ceiling on FAA Contract DTFA01-98-C-00043, which supports the Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure (TFM-I) and Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS). This action is being taken in order to respond to an urgent requirement to replace some 960 currently installed TFM-I workstations at 80+ facilities including Air Route Traffic Control Centers, Center Radar Approach facilities, Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities, Airport Terminal Control Towers, and Regional Offices. This hardware technology refresh must be completed by December 31, 2004 because the manufacturerâ€™s maintenance support for this equipment terminates December 31, 2004. Background Under the subject contract, Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) of Greenbelt, MD has provided, integrated, and installed hardware in support of the FAAâ€™s current TFM-I since mid-1998. Under the contract, NGIT also provides sustainment to TFM-I equipment and may continue to do so for the life of the contract that ends December 2006. The subject contract with NGIT includes provisions to: a.	Upgrade TFM-I hardware including computer workstations and communication equipment using COTS products, b.	Conduct familiarization training of FAA users on the installed hardware and software system, and  c.	Provide a single point of hardware maintenance support including on-site and depot. NGIT currently has a task order to provide, integrate and install some 160 network routers, replacing existing routers at all ETMS sites. The technology refresh of the workstations will require travel and coordination with the same ETMS sites. Conducting both tasks at the same time will meet agency requirements to minimize site disruptions. In addition, NGIT will be the system equipment maintainer after installation and acceptance. While the FAA is intimately aware of the workforce at, and available for, the various Traffic Management Units (TMUs), the agency presently is aware of no contractor, other than the incumbent, who can meet all these requirements within the current time frame.  Current Contract Vehicle This contract was awarded in July 1998 with a 5 Â½ year period of performance, plus options that may extend the contract an additional three years through the end of CY 2006.  Since that time, the FAA has commenced the process of a competitive acquisition for a modernized TFM System (TFM-M) and anticipates contract award by June 30, 2004. This program was approved by Joint Resources Council action in May 2003. Initially, an early task in the TFM-M contract required the contractor to complete a technology refresh of the currently installed TFM-I workstations. Due to end-of-life constraints on the workstation hardware, the FAA decided to separate the initial technology refresh task from the TFM-M contract. This was  announced on this web site on October 1, 2003.  An obvious means of conducting a separate technology refresh is by the NGIT contract. This refresh is within the scope of the FAAâ€™s current support contract; however, the additional work to perform the technology refresh will exceed the contract ceiling of $35M. An increase in the contract ceiling of $6.5 Million is planned. This amount is the anticipated funding needed for the technology refresh that replaces operational hardware at TFM-I field sites.  The execution of the technology refresh under the current NGIT Contract provides a bridge to the future TFM System Contract and requires the following NGIT tasks: a.	Conduct a site survey at each field site to determine all additional power, cabling and other site preparation needed to support the new equipment. Survey scheduling and site coordination will be accomplished by the TFM-I Program Office, ATO-R. Based on the survey, a survey report for each field site will be prepared by the contractor and submitted for FAA approval. b.	Purchase replacement equipment, including workstations and miscellaneous hardware, e.g., video splitters, cables, etc. It is expected that the contractor will identify such replacement equipment , with purchases commencing not later than March 31, 2004 in order to meet the scheduled completion date. c.	Integrate the TFM-I software baseline and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 Operating System into the new workstations at the contractorâ€™s facility. Bench-test equipment to ensure proper functioning. Integration requires detailed knowledge of the ETMS application and operating system software, integration procedures and the FAA network addressing requirements. d.	Ship equipment to the field sites in preparation for installation. e.	Supply and install interface/communication cabling at field sites to integrate new equipment and accommodate any changes to equipment configuration requirements. f.	Install equipment at each field site. Installation will be completed with no loss of the operational system or disruption of current traffic flow operations at each field site. Installation requires detailed knowledge of each type of field siteâ€™s Traffic Flow Management (TFM) operational environment and of the FAA interfaces and interactions with ETMS. It also requires knowledge and experience with ETMS application software and operating system, as well as experience and training to permit rapid field troubleshooting involving field site, William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) and Volpe ETMS personnel.  g.	Provide on-site equipment maintenance support for the new equipment. The maintenance support must be integrated into other TFM equipment maintenance, continuing the current centralized, custom call service for all TFM equipment using the existing single telephone point of contact. The FAA maintenance concept is a single hardware maintenance source for all TFM-I equipment. h.	Utilize personnel that meet the Department of Transportationâ€™s personnel security requirements as documented in the appropriate FAA regulations. If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on Friday, March 5, 2003, at the number or email address specified below

<DESC>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to conduct a bottom trawl survey of the groundfish resources of the continental shelf and slope of the United States West Coast Region.  Award will be made to either two West Coast Commercial Fishing Vessels or two "Alaska Class" Commercial Fishing Vessels.  

The West Coast Commercial Fishing Vessels will each conduct an independent survey of the shelf and slope zone from 30 to 700 fathoms, extending from the Canadian boarder around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, California. Each vessel will be paired with another vessel currently under contract with the NWFSC.  The first pair will participate in the first survey period which begins on June 1, 2004 and ends approximately 67 days later on August 6, 2004.  The second pair will serve during the second survey period, which will begin approximately August 16, 2004 and will end approximately 67 days later on October 21, 2004.  Each charter period will be broken into five to six cruise legs of seven to ten days each with a two to three day port call between legs.  Under direction of a NMFS designated chief scientist, the vessels will fish in a systematic manner with bottom trawl gear according to a pre-specified survey design and a manual governing the construction, rigging, and operation of the trawl gear used for sampling.  The trawl gear to be used during the charter will be supplied by NWFSC, as will a portable trawl instrumentation system will be used with various sensors deployed on the trawl for each tow to measure and report various aspects of the trawl's performance during sampling operations.  Prior to mobilization, at NMFS's expense, each vessel will be hauled out at a mutually agreeable time and shipyard in order to create a thru-hull/mount that will be used to install the trawl instrumentation transducer.  Vessels must be at least sixty (60) feet in registered length and the vessel's main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower of 425 and must be capable of towing at a minimum speed of 2.2 knots at a fishing depth of 700 fathoms.  The vessel must maintain a cruising speed of at least 8 knots in low sea states.  There must be berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and three (3) scientists.  One or more of the scientists may be female.  Awards will be evaluated based on Vessel Characteristics, Vessel Configuration, Vessel's Commercial Fishing History, Master/Crew Work Experience, Offeror's Qualifications & Desirable Items.  Award to the West Coast Commercial Fishing Vessels is set aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees.  

The "Alaska Class" Commercial Fishing Vessels will conduct triennial shelf bottom trawl groundfish surveys off the coast of the continental United States.  The survey will use high opening Nor' Eastern trawls equipped with roller gear to sample pre-selected stations ranging from 30 to 275 fathoms.  The survey will cover the shelf and portion of the continental slope waters off California, Oregon, and Washington.  Two vessels will be contracted to carry out this survey.  Each vessel will operate autonomously with prescribed tow locations assigned to each vessel and will conform to the survey protocols of the previous AKFSC triennial survey.  Under direction of a NMFS designated chief scientist, the vessels will fish in a systematic manner with bottom trawl gear according to a pre-specified survey design and a manual governing the construction, rigging, and operation of the trawl gear used for sampling.  The trawl gear to be used during the survey will be supplied by the NWFSC.  A portable trawl instrumentation system, also suppled by the NWFSC, that calculates and records various net mensuration and oceanographic data will also be deployed on the trawl to aid in the evaluation of trawl performance.  Both vessels chartered will commence in either Newport, Oregon, or in Seattle Washington on or around May 31, 2004 and will terminate in either Morro Bay, California, or in Newport, Oregon on or around July 29th.  The duration of the charter will be 60 days with an option, at the request of the government, to extend the charter up to 10 days.  The operational plan for this survey may be modified prior to the actual start of the survey but changes in dates of operation and ports used for cruise leg breaks will be coordinated with the Contractor.  Vessels must be at least 120 feet in registered length and the vessel's main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower output of 1000.  The vessel must be able to tow the standard survey trawl, a 27.4/36.5 m (90/120 ft) Poly Nor' Eastern trawl with rubber bobbin roller gear or tire gear at a continuous speed of 5.6 km/hr (3 knots) under normally expected fishing conditions.  The vessel must maintain a cruising speed of at least 16.8 km/hr in low sea states.  There must be berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and a maximum of six (6) scientists.  One or more of the scientists may be female.  Awards will be evaluated based on Vessel Characteristics, Vessel Accommodations, Trawl Experience, Past Performance of Vessel, Captain and Crew, Desirable Items & Safety.  Award to "Alaska Class" Commercial Fishing Vessels is unrestricted.    
 A request for proposals providing detailed technical and performance specifications and proposal instructions will be issued on or about March 10, 2004.  For a copy of the solicitation, you must register on the FBO to "receive notification".

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contact under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with HCI  300 Catalina Court, Suite 1000.., Sterling, Va. 20166, for Index and Script Software.The application has already been developed, delivered,  and tested by an earlier award to HCI.  Implementation of Index Script to the tested application will require changes in the application.  Total cost for this requirement will NTE $26,250.00 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a requirement to develop software that provides the caller with Bureau of Labor Statistics economic data.  The caller will make their selection from various menus and also have the option to have a copy of the script faxed to them.

The Index data resides on a flat file, which shall be FTPed onto Conversant and uploaded onto Oracle database.  Shell scripts shall be developed to take the Index Script data and create the script document to be faxed to the caller.  There are a total of thirty-two (32) screens and each screen has the option of faxing.  Therefore, thirty-two shell scripts shall be written in order to generate a report for each option.  Thereby, making it unnecessary for BLS to provide the Index Script data in a text or TIFF format.

Since the application has already been developed and tested implementation of Index Script to the tested application will require changes in the application.  The application is currently hard-coded with Index Script Report file name provided by BLS.  To implement provided solution, the application has to be changed completely to include logic, to execute script, to generate Index Script Reports as stated in the tasks below: 
•Application code shall be reviewed to make sure changes are
 incorporated in all the places.
•Call-flow needs shall be re-tested to check if scripts have been
 executed. 
•New application needs shall be installed on BLS' site, which    
 shall be re-tested by BLS. Support shall be provided to BLS   
 during this testing.
•Thirty-two (32) Shell Scripts shall be written to generate Index 
 Script Report.
•Local Oracle databases shall interface with the application and  
 shall be developed in English only.
•BLS will record all menus and announcements.
      DELIVERABLES:
•The contractor shall provide the following deliverables during   
 the course of the development of these applications:
   Description                         Delivery Date After Award 
                                  
• A Project Plan that represents the design,       8 Days

  specified under the statement of work.                        
• A Design Document that includes all of the 
  design decisions                                8 days    
  made during the course of this development.
• Completion of the Application change.           30 days   
• When the customized software will be ready for 
  deployment                                      30 days

<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.

<DESC>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with The BOC Group, Murray Hill NJ, for atmospheric gas analysis services as described in the Sources Sought Notice posted 29 Oct 03.  Analysis services are primarily concerned with the processing, separation, and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification.  This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and acquisition history concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options.  This effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$10.0 million.  A Nuclear Regulatory approved Radioactive Materials License is required.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security intends to issue a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with two options to AS&E on a sole source basis for the development of upgrades to the Department's existing AS&E systems under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only one Responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The upgrades include: 1)Threat Image Projection (TIP): TIP refers to the insertion of threat images into radiography scans in real-time.  Radiological and nuclear threats will be addressed.  TIP will be used both as a training tool and during normal operations to maintain operator proficiency.
2)Operator Assist/Alert (OAA):  OAA will highlight areas of the display to the investigator, to indicate the presence of a potential threat, based on a pre-determined set of conditions.  For example, this alert may indicate areas of complete x-ray attenuation.
3)Data Transmission (DT):  Depending upon the system, wire or wireless data transmission capability will be integrated into the systems listed above.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently owns and operates the following AS&E radiography systems:

•	MoblieSearch (MXTR)
•	PalletSearch
•	Model 101 Van
•	CargoSearch
•	Z-Backscatter Van

The Phase I effort is for a development and implementation plan.  Option one is for the development of TIP, OAA, and DT for the above systems.  Option two is for the demonstration, training, and assessment of TIP, OAA, and DT in the above systems.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command, (NAVSEA), Washington Navy Yard, DC, intends to issue a firm-fixed-price (FFP), full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting for the manufacture and delivery of MK 288 Mod 1 Igniter Assemblies. The igniter assemblies are used in the propulsion system of the MK 48/ADCAP Torpedo. The igniter is an electrically initiated pyrotechnic device designed to activate the startup sequence for a MK 48/ADCAP Torpedo propulsion engine. The igniter internal cavity contains a pyrotechnic charge hermetically sealed by a welded end closure. The pyrotechnic material is in contact with a thin metallic wire bridging two electrical leads which exit the body head through fused glass seal circuitry. The igniter body has external threads, a preformed packing seat, and a hex head designed for sealed installation into a standard boss port. The igniter is fired by an electrical charge that causes rapid heating of the thin bridge wire and ignition of the pyrotechnic material, resulting in generation and expulsion of hot gas. Based on existing funding, program profiles and Government estimates, it is anticipated that the resulting competitive contract will provide for the procurement of approximately one thousand (1,000) igniters in the Base Year, plus four one-year options to acquire as many as twelve hundred (1,200) for each option year. The Government currently anticipates that the evaluation criteria used in this competition will focus strongly on technical ability, past performance and price. The anticipated competition will be based on a build-to-print hardware specification. In total, this contract is anticipated to provide the Navy with a contract vehicle to efficiently and cost-effectively acquire torpedo propulsion i gniters in order to support fleet readiness needs. For planning purposes and to promote competition, one page E-mail expressions of interest denoting ?PRIME CONTRACTOR CONSIDERATION? are requested from all potential offerors. 1) all pertinent company information (name, address, state of incorporation, etc.) and 2) appropriate business unit, subcontractor and small business points of contact, should be included and submitted to this office to the care of Mr. Andrew Creedon at CreedonAJ@navsea.navy.mil. These expressions of interest should be submitted no later than 4:00PM, EST on November 21, 2003. Be advised that this point of contact information may be released to the public. The official RFP will be released on or before December 1, 2003 under RFP No. N00024-04-R-6104. A draft RFP may be released before the posting of the official RFP. Responses to posted pre-solicitati on documents, if any, are welcome but official Government correspondences will only be made during the official solicitation phase of the contract.*****

<DESC>This procurement requires the contractor to deactivate, tear down, 
remove, and ship the NSRR Mid Course Radar(MCR).  As a result of Base Reallocation and Closure, the Navy requires these radars removed NLT 1 July 2004.  The Contract will be awarded to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS).

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) intends to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contract with a firm fixed price pricing arrangement to Vantage Associates Incorporated, 900 Civic Center Drive, National City, CA.  SSC San Diego intends to acquire on a firm fixed price basis two types of Joint Tactical Information Distribution System wrap-around radomes that protect the Link-16 antenna:  1) frequency selective surface radomes, with a quantity ceiling of 150 radomes and  2)  frequency transparent radomes with a quantity ceiling of 150 radomes.   The ordering period is anticipated to be five (5) years duration.  This procurement will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) (Follow-on contract for the production of highly specialized equipment).  Vantage Associates is the incumbent on the current contract N66001-01-D-5013 and a predecessor contract N66001-96-D-0011. With many years experience manufacturing these two items, Vantage Associates Incorporated has gained specialized knowledge and manufacturing experience the value of which would not be recovered through competition.  Additionally, as the incumbent, Vantage Associates Incorporated is the only manufacturer who would not be required to submit a first article for testing.  The cost to the Government for first article testing is estimated at $56,800.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Non-Profit Management, Inc., Washington, DC. 

Non-Profit Management, Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform the requirements  for the following reasons.
Non-Profit Management, Inc. has been for the past three years videotaping the proceedings of the Rosalynn Carter Symposiums.  The company videotaped the entire symposium at which the report of the President’s Commission on Mental Health was unveiled.  As a result, it is the sole owner of the footage required to produce the video and ensuing educational materials.
	The contractor will develop a motivational video and accompanying educational/instructional materials using footage taken at prior Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health, including the one at which the 2002-2003 President’s Commission on Mental Health report was released to highlight the Commission’s findings and recommendations .  Video and educational materials will be developed by Contractor for use by advocates, families and consumers of mental health across the country.
President Bush signed an Executive Order on June 18, 2001 supporting community-based services and programs for individuals with disabilities. The Executive Order directs key federal agencies to work together and with states to ensure full compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling in the Olmstead case (1999) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
Since the first commission, the Rosalynn Carter Center on Mental Health has been hosting symposiums to address the needs of the mental health community in the nation for several years.  The final report of the just concluded commission was released at the Carter Center’s 19th Symposium held last year.  
Historical perspective is crucial in the development of the educational videos required by this purchase order.  Given their ongoing relationship with the Carter Center, their vast experience on mental health issues and sole possession of footage of past and current mental health symposiums, including the full report of the 2002-2003 President’s Commission, Non-Profit Management is the only company that can produce the requested materials while effectively conveying the challenges faced by the mental health community throughout the years.
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with the University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire, for the purpose of conducting the annual Non-Lethal Technology and Academic Research (NTAR) Symposium.  NTAR is designed to create a synergistic environment for cross fertilization of current and emerging ideas in non-lethal technologies, including cross fertilization of current and emerging ideas in non-lethal technologies including societal perceptions of NLW. This symposium unites the academic, industry, government and military communities and serves to:
1.	Educate innovative academic researchers about the global social context which is driving the emerging field of non-lethality; 
2.	Inform academic researchers of the current non-lethal needs, thus extending the boundaries of thinking of the academic community;
3.	Expose leaders and decision-makers to "over-the-horizon" opportunities, thereby bringing non-lethal technologies deeper into the planning process; 
4.	Facilitate collaboration between industry and academia to foster the development of cutting edge technologies.

The symposium is scheduled for 2 ½ days during the latter half of either October or November 2004 in the Research Triangle Park/Duke University, North Carolina, locale.  The topics and agenda for this symposium will be derived from the Joint Non-Lethal Directorate’s (JNLWD) priority list and from ongoing or recently completed grants managed by Non-Lethal Technology Investment Center (NTIC).

No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature and pricing, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above (SmithP@jnlwd.usmc.mil / 703.432.0894).

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type Contract to Concurrent Computer Corporation of Duluth, Georgia, for supplies necessary to procure Stimulation-Simulation Systems.  These supplies are needed to support the System for Naval Target Control (SNTC) system, which is an Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Target Control System (TCS).  The simulation system connects to and stimulates the actual Target Ground Control System (GCS), presenting the actual flight characteristics of an Aerial Target selected (BQM-34 & 74).  The system has the capability to induce failures or reduced performance to the Remote Control Operator (RCO) under instruction. Concurrent is the only manufacturer of simulation systems that are currently in use at Navy facilities.  Procurement of another system would not be cost effective for the government.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>99--Proposed Ceiling Increase to Contract DTFA01-98-C-00043
<SOLNBR>3512
<RESPDATE>030504
<CONTACT>Tim Eckert, 202-385-8454
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to increase the ceiling on FAA Contract DTFA01-98-C-00043, which supports the Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure (TFM-I) and Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS). This action is being taken in order to respond to an urgent requirement to replace some 960 currently installed TFM-I workstations at 80+ facilities including Air Route Traffic Control Centers, Center Radar Approach facilities, Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities, Airport Terminal Control Towers, and Regional Offices. This hardware technology refresh must be completed by December 31, 2004 because the manufacturers maintenance support for this equipment terminates December 31, 2004. Background Under the subject contract, Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) of Greenbelt, MD has provided, integrated, and installed hardware in support of the FAAs current TFM-I since mid-1998. Under the contract, NGIT also provides sustainment to TFM-I equipment and may continue to do so for the life of the contract that ends December 2006. The subject contract with NGIT includes provisions to: a.	Upgrade TFM-I hardware including computer workstations and communication equipment using COTS products, b.	Conduct familiarization training of FAA users on the installed hardware and software system, and  c.	Provide a single point of hardware maintenance support including on-site and depot. NGIT currently has a task order to provide, integrate and install some 160 network routers, replacing existing routers at all ETMS sites. The technology refresh of the workstations will require travel and coordination with the same ETMS sites. Conducting both tasks at the same time will meet agency requirements to minimize site disruptions. In addition, NGIT will be the system equipment maintainer after installation and acceptance. While the FAA is intimately aware of the workforce at, and available for, the various Traffic Management Units (TMUs), the agency presently is aware of no contractor, other than the incumbent, who can meet all these requirements within the current time frame.  Current Contract Vehicle This contract was awarded in July 1998 with a 5 Â½ year period of performance, plus options that may extend the contract an additional three years through the end of CY 2006.  Since that time, the FAA has commenced the process of a competitive acquisition for a modernized TFM System (TFM-M) and anticipates contract award by June 30, 2004. This program was approved by Joint Resources Council action in May 2003. Initially, an early task in the TFM-M contract required the contractor to complete a technology refresh of the currently installed TFM-I workstations. Due to end-of-life constraints on the workstation hardware, the FAA decided to separate the initial technology refresh task from the TFM-M contract. This was  announced on this web site on October 1, 2003.  An obvious means of conducting a separate technology refresh is by the NGIT contract. This refresh is within the scope of the FAA's current support contract; however, the additional work to perform the technology refresh will exceed the contract ceiling of $35M. An increase in the contract ceiling of $6.5 Million is planned. This amount is the anticipated funding needed for the technology refresh that replaces operational hardware at TFM-I field sites.  The execution of the technology refresh under the current NGIT Contract provides a bridge to the future TFM System Contract and requires the following NGIT tasks: a.	Conduct a site survey at each field site to determine all additional power, cabling and other site preparation needed to support the new equipment. Survey scheduling and site coordination will be accomplished by the TFM-I Program Office, ATO-R. Based on the survey, a survey report for each field site will be prepared by the contractor and submitted for FAA approval. b.	Purchase replacement equipment, including workstations and miscellaneous hardware, e.g., video splitters, cables, etc. It is expected that the contractor will identify such replacement equipment , with purchases commencing not later than March 31, 2004 in order to meet the scheduled completion date. c.	Integrate the TFM-I software baseline and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 Operating System into the new workstations at the contractor's facility. Bench-test equipment to ensure proper functioning. Integration requires detailed knowledge of the ETMS application and operating system software, integration procedures and the FAA network addressing requirements. d.	Ship equipment to the field sites in preparation for installation. e.	Supply and install interface/communication cabling at field sites to integrate new equipment and accommodate any changes to equipment configuration requirements. f.	Install equipment at each field site. Installation will be completed with no loss of the operational system or disruption of current traffic flow operations at each field site. Installation requires detailed knowledge of each type of field site's Traffic Flow Management (TFM) operational environment and of the FAA interfaces and interactions with ETMS. It also requires knowledge and experience with ETMS application software and operating system, as well as experience and training to permit rapid field troubleshooting involving field site, William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) and Volpe ETMS personnel.  g.	Provide on-site equipment maintenance support for the new equipment. The maintenance support must be integrated into other TFM equipment maintenance, continuing the current centralized, custom call service for all TFM equipment using the existing single telephone point of contact. The FAA maintenance concept is a single hardware maintenance source for all TFM-I equipment. h.	Utilize personnel that meet the Department of Transportation's personnel security requirements as documented in the appropriate FAA regulations. If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on Friday, March 5, 2004, at the number or email address specified herein.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR. The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive a basic contract award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. Otherwise eligible 8a and HUBZone contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site. The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type Contract to Concurrent Computer Corporation of Duluth, Georgia, for supplies necessary to procure Stimulation-Simulation Systems.  These supplies are needed to support the System for Naval Target Control (SNTC) system, which is an Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Target Control System (TCS).  The simulation system connects to and stimulates the actual Target Ground Control System (GCS), presenting the actual flight characteristics of an Aerial Target selected (BQM-34 & 74).  The system has the capability to induce failures or reduced performance to the Remote Control Operator (RCO) under instruction. Concurrent is the only manufacturer of simulation systems that are currently in use at Navy Target sites for the Aerial Target Simulation systems.  Procurement of another system would not be cost effective for the government.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Note 22. NAVAIR Synopsis No. 03-146.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), a primary level field activity (PLFA) of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is seeking sources that can assist DRMS in fulfilling our mission of hazardous waste disposal in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  This support is required in Iraq and surrounding areas.  Principal location in Iraq is the U.S. Army Base Anaconda, near Baghdad, but may be expanded to other sites as yet to be determined.  

The contractor would be required to provide equipment (including an incinerator) and personnel necessary for the incineration of hazardous waste and other non-hazardous property, i.e. certain expendable textiles.  Local incineration of hazardous waste may be deemed the most advantageous method of hazardous waste disposal, given the current state of the mission in Iraq.  The incinerator used must be mobile, and meet the requirements of the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) as required for the incineration of hazardous wastes in countries not governed by customary environmental regulations (i.e. RCRA, FGS, and EU etc.)  NAICS code is 562211.

Anticipated hazardous waste streams would include batteries, solvents, decontaminating agents and kits, solid waste containing heavy metals, pesticides, waste oil and fuel, grease, POL contaminated solids and soil, filters, aerosol cans, uncontrolled medicine, ethylene glycol, spill residue and empty containers that previously held hazardous materials.  Anticipated generations are 3.7 million pounds (1.7 million KG) over an 18- month period.

Interested and qualified sources are requested to provide the following information:  (1) company name, point of contact, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and type and business size, (2) information telling us about your company and why you think you can perform on this type of contract, (3) and a statement of current capability, (4) estimated cost of operation for an 18-month period.

Potential interested contractors may be invited to participate in an open forum to discuss the availability of the technologies sought, and establish the framework for the forthcoming solicitation.

<RESPDATE>032604
<ARCHDATE>05252004
<CONTACT>Christine Scena, 573-596-0252
<DESC>Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri seeks an electrical utility company to assume ownership, operation, and maintenance of the electrical distribution utility system infrastructures at the Fort Leonard Wood (FLW) Lake of the Ozarks Recreation Area (LORA), an d to provide electricity to each Government connection within the LORA service premises.   The United States Army has a land lease, Lease No. DA-23-028-ENG-4667, with the State of Missouri Park Board, Jefferson City, Missouri, for approximately 359 acres located within the Lake of the Ozarks State Park, Township 39 North, Range 15 West, Sections  29, 30 & 32, Camden County.  The leased area is known as the Lake of the Ozarks Recreation Area (LORA), and is a U. S. Army Facility providing morale, welfare, and recreation services to Army personnel.  The current lease, in accordance with its terms, is  in force through 30 June 2010.  The lease agreement provides that the United States Government shall have the option to extend the lease for an additional period of fifty (50) years.  No decision has been made at this time to extend said lease. The Government will only acquire electric utility services through a contract that may result from this solicitation if it conveys the electrical distribution utility systems, as authorized by and conducted under 10 USC Ã‚Â§ 2688.  Any contract for electri c utility services will be for the purchase of electricity, and inclusive of all requirements for the distribution of the purchased electricity to each Government connection within the LORA service premises.  The contract period of performance will be for the lesser of a term of fifty (50) years from the performance start date, or for the term from the performance start date to the termination of the existing land lease agreement, either prior to or during any subsequent extension period thereof. The conveyance will transfer all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the electrical distribution utility systems, however the divestiture will not include the State of Missouri owned real property upon, under, or around the utility sy stems, nor provide an easement to the Utility for these systems that are located on State of Missouri real property.  Any easement for these electrical distribution utility systems required by the State will be solely and entirely a matter between the Util ity and the State of Missouri. The Utility shall furnish all necessary permits, facilities, management, supervision, labor, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvem ents of these systems, and shall accept full liability for the LORA electrical distribution utility systems.  The Utility shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, improve, and maintain the LORA electrical distribution u tility systems in a safe and reliable condition, and to manage and operate the systems to ensure adequate and dependable electrical service is provided to each Government connection within the LORA service premises.         The electrical distribution utility system @ LORA is a small system, consisting of approximately 8,970 lineal feet of overhead 7.2kV single phase primary distribution lines, 12 transformers with approximately 52 service connections for the various building s, structures, and trailers, and associated secondary distribution lines and lighting.  The Government owned electrical distribution utility systems are currently operated and maintained by a contract that is separate from the GSA Area-Wide Contract for th e purchase of the commodity.  Electricity is provided by AmerenUE through the GSA contract to two (2) 7.2kV service locations, which are also the demarcation points for the Government owned systems.  The total average kilo-watt-hours (kWh) usage for the th ree (3) previous years (FY 00 through FY 02) for LORA was approximately 669 ,052 kWh.      The Government will only consider proposals from offerors who are regularly engaged in the business of electrical utility service to the general public as an electric utility.  The Fort Leonard Wood Lake of the Ozarks Recreation Area is within the certific ated electric service area of AmerenUE, with established territorial rights approved and granted by the State of Missouri.  Alternate electric suppliers must provide representation that service can be provided in a manner that is not inconsistent with Sect ion 8093 of Public Law 100-202, which, in general, requires purchases of electricity by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States to be consistent with State law governing the provision of electric utility service, including State uti lity commission rulings and electric utility franchises or service territories established pursuant to State statute, State regulation, or State-approved territorial agreements.  The representation must be supported with appropriate legal and factual ratio nale, to include copies of any applicable territorial agreements that have been approved by the State of Missouri.  If the Government does not receive any evidence that viable legal alternative sources exist, our intent is to conduct a sole source negotiat ed procurement with Ameren ERC, Inc. (previously AmerenUE).   The point of contact for the above requirement is Chris Scena, Contract Specialist, (573) 596-0252.

<SUBJECT>D -- Enhancement of library MARC records
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-AULibrary
<RESPDATE>030904
<ARCHDATE>03242004
<CONTACT>Kimberly Knott, Contract Specialist, Phone 334-953-6242, Fax 334-953-2198, Email kimberly.knott@maxwell.af.mil - Kimberly Knott, Contract Specialist, Phone 334-953-6242, Fax 334-953-2198, Email kimberly.knott@maxwell.af.mil
<DESC>Description: This is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.  The RFI is for enhancing Air University’s Library (AUL) MARC records, to include table of contents information, and possibly author information, to be delivered in MARC standard format.  AUL is using Voyager’s Endeavor system, and is interested in a vendor with experience with Endeavor, so that such enhanced records would be accepted by our system.  Our current release of the Endeavor system-cataloging module is Version 2001.2.1 Build 3302 (production version).

SUGGESTED OUTLINE FOR RESPONSES:  
1) Address the process by which AUL would submit MARC records for enhancement, and the vendor would then enhance such records and resend to AUL for inclusion in the Endeavor system.  
2) What is the cost per record?   
3) What is the turn around time? 
4) Does the process add 505, 520 and perhaps 040 subfield to indicate the source of the record, without changing other fields within the record?  (The latter is of supreme importance, as we do not wish to have the other fields in the records overwritten when we load the updated records into our system.) If the AUL record already has a 505 or 520, is the field replaced, or is an additional 505 or 520 added to the record?  
5) Is the match based on ISBN, with the LCCN number as the secondary match point if there is no ISBN?  
6) Many records have multiple records, such as for the hardcover and the paperback.  Does this cause problems, or cause the system to generate two matches for which we would be charged twice, or is there a mechanism in place which would preclude that?  
7) When the records come back to the library, is there any sort of report that indicates which records have been enhanced, and which have not?  
7a) What staff creates the enhancements, or are the records purchased from elsewhere?  7b) What is the approximate number of titles for which such enhanced records are currently available from the vendor, and what is an approximation of the number of titles for which enhanced records are added per year?
7c) How could we find out how many of our records have enhanced records available through the vendor?  
7d) Could we send some sort of file, perhaps broken down by periods of copyright years, in order to obtain such pricing?  (Example would be all records for books with copyright dates from 2000 to the present, in order to determine not just a cost per record, but what the cost for our particular records would be, based on actual rather than estimated matches.) Please highlight any contract vehicles/schedules available to streamline any potential solicitation.  After responses are reviewed, the contractor may be required to provide a demonstration at no additional cost to the Government.

The Government has the right to use any of the information provided by contractors to develop our solicitation.  If an offeror objects to this, do not submit the information. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Although “proposal” and “offer” are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  Again, this synopsis is issued for the purpose of INFORMATION and PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  Responses will be accepted in any format by 1200 PM CST on Mar 9, 2004, to TSgt Kimberly Knott. Phone (334)953-6242; fax (334)953-2198.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Applied Information Systems Research" (AISR) No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the NASA Research Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space Science (NRA 03-OSS-01)" Appendix A.4.3 entitled "Applied Information Systems Research" (AISR) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released Amendment No. 9 to NASA Research Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space Science" (NRA 03-OSS-01) that establishes a new Program Element A.4.3 in Appendix A entitled "Applied Information Systems Research" (AISR).  See http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/NRA-03-OSS-01/index.html. This new element is seeking innovative ideas for the uses of computer science and technology to enhance space science research productivity.	The specific goals of the AISR program are to:  · Investigate novel information technologies and computational methods that have the potential to increase productivity of the OSS research and/or education and public outreach endeavors, and which would extend the state-of-the-practice in space science;  · Demonstrate the degree of relevance, applicability, and potential impact of emerging information technologies to OSS missions and programs; and  ·      Foster interdisciplinary collaborations that span the space science and computer science disciplines.  The AISR program seeks innovative ideas for uses of information technology to increase life cycle effectiveness and efficiency of the OSS research endeavor across all of its science themes.   Suggested (unprioritized) objectives for proposals to this program are to:  ·    Reduce mission development time, risk, and cost through, for example, advanced simulation and design capabilities;  ·   Increase mission duration and reliability through, for example, autonomous operations and control, improved dynamic scheduling, fault tolerant and/or adaptable computing, etc.;  ·	  Increase data return through, for example, onboard science autonomy and intelligent compression; and/or  ·      Increase science or educational return from the data through, for example, advanced knowledge discovery, data synthesis and data presentation methodologies.	Background information and abstracts for current investigations in the AISR program can be found on-line at http://ssds.nasa.gov/aisrp .  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the AISR Program to develop proposals. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: William Edwards, Mail Stop 469, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: william.c.edwards@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB March 4, 2004.  Technical questions should be addressed to the technical points of contact indicated below.  The following LaRC technology proposal is seeking partnerships.  Untethered Navigational Interface for Virtual Interactive Simulations (UNIVIS): A  Multi-Function Portable Wireless Virtual Reality System for Mission Design and Collaboration: Technical Contact Kerry Gough, (757) 864-7942, kerry.m.gough@nasa.gov or Danette Allen, (757) 864-7364, danette.allen@nasa.gov . NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners with which to develop an untethered Virtual Reality (VR) hardware and software system, employing head-mounted displays (HMDs), data gloves, and optical six degrees of freedom (6DOF) tracking technology for space and industry applications.  Inter-process communication for this system will be realized using commercial off-the-shelf wireless communication standards.   The technologies desired by partners include the following: ·	Optical Tracking: Virtual environment simulations for the system require simultaneous, independent real-time use by multiple users for a wide area.  The intended installation area for this system requires a minimum of 800 square feet of coverage without degradation of response or accuracy.  The proposed 6DOF wireless tracker should be designed to provide continuous accuracy within at least 1 mm in any direction of location and at least 0.1 degree of angular precision.  In order for the system to provide maximum realism with minimal breaks in presence, the wireless tracking system must provide a minimum update rate of 1200 Hz for a single sensor.  Rate reduction for multiple sensors is acceptable but should not fall below 400 Hz per sensor.  Solutions developed for this project should interface with the existing 3rdTech HiBall optical tracking system.  ·	 User Studies:	Studies are also planned to quantify and compare effectiveness of virtual environments in the untethered system, relative to similar environments experienced in traditional wired HMD-based VR systems.  Partners should be experienced in the acquisition and analysis of physiological measures of presence in virtual environments.  User studies may be performed at both LaRC and offsite locations to gather independent assessments of effectiveness in virtual environments for correlative measurement purposes. Responses must include the following:	name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	TECHNICAL QUESTIONS should be directed to:  KERRY GOUGH 757-864-7942. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Mary Jane Yeager 757-864-2473. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<DESC>On February 23, 2004, The U.S. Army announced the termination of the Comanche Helicopter program.  As a result, the Army will restructure aviation organizations to reflect current and anticipated needs, increase aircraft survivability, sustainability , and operability, divest programs that no longer meet the needs of the changing operational environment, and extend aviation capabilities beyond the 2020 timeframe. With the reallocation of associated resources from the Comanche program, we will restructu re and revitalize Army aviation to meet our current and future needs, and reenergize our commitment to OSD and Army Transformation and FCS. Specifically, the enhanced Army aviation program will undertake the following: 	1.) Accelerate air crew protection and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) fielding initiatives to meet the current and evolving threat while providing every aircraft with the best possible equipment.  	2.) Modernize 1400 aircraft to extend aviation capabilities beyond 2020. This effort will include Apache Block III conversion, and recapitalization of aircraft.   	3.) Acquire almost 800 new aircraft (thru FY 11) to build modular AC and RC aviation formations. This will include the purchase of a new Light Reconnaissance Helicopter, additional new build Blackhawks and Chinooks, and a new Cargo Fixed Wing aircraft. 	4.) Add $300M to accelerate the UAV program to extend battlefield awareness and strengthen manned-unmanned teaming 	5.) Transform Reserve and Guard aviation by replacing over 850 aging aircraft and standardizing AC and RC aviation organizations. This will include a new Light Utility Helicopter.  	6.) Leverage the technology base and knowledge gained through the Comanche program as appropriate and invest in Joint aviation programs. These investments will include a Common Cockpit and Fly-by-Wire technology and the Army will initiate a Joint Multi-ro le Helicopter program. 	This effort is a substantial redirection of Army funding.  The Program Executive Office, Aviation seeks your comments and suggestions on how to accomplish the goals set forth above with specific emphasis on the manner in which the Army and our industrial partners can best execute the stated objectives and your assessment of industrial base impacts. It is requested that you provide your comments and input to the address below no later than March 26, 2004.

Qualifications, Experience, and Past Performance:  The Contractor shall have a minimum of five (5) consecutive years work experience making custom form liners to create formed concrete surfaces to match natural stone shapes and surface textures.  Submit a list of three (3) recently completed installations (no more than five (5) years from present) that represent custom form liner development for a specialized project using simulated natural stone-walls with textured vertical surfaces.  Include the project name and location; project budget for the simulated natural stone portion of the textured concrete work performed by the Concrete Installer; and the address and phone number of the owner or owners representative with knowledge of the work performed.

Submit a minimum of three (3) recent 8 inch by 10 inch color photographs of each installation stated above as evidence of the experience and ability to produce textured vertical surfaces with the use of form liners.  The photographs are to be taken at various distances (10 feet, 20 feet, and 50 feet) from the textured vertical surfaces to distinguish details and overall quality of the work.  The photographs will be used to determine the aesthetic appearance of the walls.  Provide a work plan and a proposed schedule for completing the work (Items 1,2, and 3 listed under Drawings & Submittals) within the required time.  This information will be used to evaluate the Contractors understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.  All Work must be completed within 120 calendar days.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  This work consists of creating a textured form liner for a special surface texture.  The design will be such that it replicates the exiting mortared schist retaining walls at Sequoia National Park near Three Rivers, California.  The form liner will emulate the size, shape, texture, stone spacing, joint sizes, and overall appearance of these existing walls.  The form liner will be used on cast-in-place type concrete cantilever retaining walls and cast-in-place type guard walls.  The chosen form liner pattern will be used as the standard wall facing for a 2.565 km roadway reconstruction project in Sequoia National Park.  It is estimated that 225 meters of the road will have retaining walls that are required to be faced with the form liner, and that 225 meters of the road will have guardwalls that are required to be faced with form liner.  Retaining wall heights will range from 0.785 to 4.835 meters throughout the project; the height of guardwalls is 0.785 meters.  Form Liner Requirements:  The form liner panels shall simulate the natural stone masonry and texture of the existing schist masonry retaining walls located in Sequoia National Park.  The form liner panels shall provide a variety of sizes of the natural stones as well as variance in the spacing of the stones as exhibited in the existing schist masonry walls. Exercise care to eliminate nesting or bunching of similar sized stones.  This requires the smallest stone size to fall within the following ranges:  150 mm by 225 mm or 300 mm by 450 mm.  Stones with unique and visually identifying character that become apparent when reused in a wall panel or easily identifiable will not be allowed.  The individual stones in the form liner pattern shall have a realistic look of schist stone, and have a variety of surface relief consisting of but not all inclusive to smoothness, roughness, dimples, cracks, undulations, etc.  Stones of maximum or minimum bulge shall not be bunched together, but shall be randomly placed throughout the retaining wall.  The bulge of individual stones shall be irregular to provide a variety in the texture of the entire surface.  The form liner relief should vary; should not be uniform.  The jointing plan of the individual stones will vary throughout the total patterning to give a variety of relief in the overall appearance of the natural stone pattern.  Form liner panels shall abut to each other in the joint regions of the stone pattern when configuring the form liner panel layout.  No noticeable abutting lines, or pattern created by abutting lines, shall be visibly apparent on the finished wall.  All construction expansion and control joints shall occur in the recess joint regions of the stone pattern with careful design of long horizontal stone lengths being avoided.  The arrangement of the form liner panels shall provide a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition within 19 meters horizontally.  Vertically, the appearance of the stone pattern is to have a maximum amount of variety and no two liners can be connected to each other.  No liners of like kind shall be placed adjacent to each other.  Drawings and Submittals:  Approval of custom designed, natural stone, special surface texture (form liner) will be a follows:  (1) Preliminary Shop Drawings.  The Contractor shall submit five (5) sets of preliminary shop drawings to the COTR for review.  The preliminary shop drawings will be of simulated schist stone pattern form liner panels based on the specifications stated in the scope of work.  Provide preliminary shop drawings on 24 by 36 inch sheets.  Reduced-sized drawings will be required as necessary.  The preliminary shop drawings will include but not be limited to the following:  Plan view, elevation view, and details showing overall patterns of natural schist stones in the form liner;  Individual form liner panel designs, patterns, and gang panel layouts; Stone pattern descriptions, dimensions, and sequencing of form liner sections; Representative drawings of form liner panel layouts for the retaining walls.  Representative drawings shall show:  the retaining wall back-side and actual height, and the height of the tallest wall, showing stepped footings.
The arrangement of form liner panels that provide a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition.  On the drawings, show representative views of completed form lined walls with each form liner panel outlined in a dark line, and completed from lined walls without each form liner panel outlined.  Critical features include but are not limited to irregularities in stone patterns such as rock clusters, rosettes, linear rocks, and mortar joints.  Details showing typical cross section of walls, joints, corners, step footings, stone size, working line, joint and bed depths, joint locations, and end, edge, and other conditions.

The Contractor shall investigate the Government’s needs.  Each prospective offeror will develop a quote package, consisting of simple diagrammatical sketch(s), quotes, and narrative instructions detailing the system that would be installed to satisfy the parameters of American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), meeting the occupational exposure limit of 1mg/m3, and the needs of the Government.  Upon award, contractor will provide the design, required equipment with Spec sheets, to include all project management, supervision, labor, parts, material, installation, and transportation for a dust collection system in Building 356, the Skills Development Center, at FE Warren AFB, Wyoming.  Building 356 is a registered State Historical facility located on F. E. Warren AFB (Cheyenne) Wyoming.  This facility currently houses the Skills Development Center (Wood Hobby Shop) employing several craftsmen.  The Skills Development Center is currently serviced by an antiquated dust collection system that does not meet the health standards established by ACGIH.  THIS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) is for the planning and installation of a new dust collection system and the demolition of the existing dust collection system. Determination for award shall be made in accordance with THE BASIS FOR AWARD criteria of this solicitation.  In order for this facility to maintain its revenue, it is imperative that down time of the center be held to an absolute minimum, preferably less than one week.

There are four phases required for this project:

Phase I: Investigative Design for Quote; Phase II:  Design; Phase III:  Installation; Phase IV: Demolition/Disposal 

PHASE I:  INVESTIGATIVE DESIGN FOR QUOTE-

Each prospective offeror is highly encouraged to attend a scheduled site visit to examine the building and the wood shop operation.  Prospective offerors will each develop a quote package, consisting of simple diagrammatical sketch(s), quotes, and equipment specifications detailing the system that would be installed to satisfy the parameters of ACGIH, meet the occupational exposure limit of 1mg/m3, and the needs of the Government.  It is recommended the quote package be as complete as possible since it will be one of the products evaluated for award.  Offers are due 12 March 2004, NLT COB 4:00PM, MST.  Packages will be evaluated; IAW criteria set forth in section entitle EVALUATION CRITERIA.  Award will be made prior to continuing to Phase II.

Technical Acceptance: Reference EVALUATION CRITERIA,(3)Basis For Award,(b)BEST VALUE ASSESSMENT, 3. Technical Acceptance.  

PHASE II:  DESIGN-

A.  Design Requirements/Information-

Design drawings and specifications shall be developed with the aim to minimize cost and structural impact to the building.  The room area of the wood shop, which contains equipment to be serviced by the new dust collection system, is approximately 250 sq. ft.  Attachment 4, which will be e-mail upon request, is a diagram of positions for each woodworking machine that requires dust collection exhaust air for this project. 

The dust collector/blower unit will be located on the west side of the building to minimize the visual impact from South Frontier Road.  The new dust collector/blower unit will be placed on an unused concrete pad located outside the west wall of the building.  There is the possibility of building a new concrete pad if the existing concrete is of insufficient quality or depth to hold the new dust collector/blower unit.  If the offeror determines a new pad is required, the offeror must adequately identify the manufacturer’s requirement for the concrete pad.  This line item will not be used in the evaluation of pricing and shall be identified as a separate sub-line item to Installation.

The current electrical system is not sufficient to handle the anticipated load of the new dust collection/blower system.   The contractor must include electrical requirements to the Government in their offer.  The 90th Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) will be responsible for upgrading the electrical system to meet the requirements of the new dust collection system.

American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists contains the regulatory information to which the exhaust airflow limits for the new dust collection system must be designed.  It specifies each woodworking machine that exists in Building 356 and its required exhaust flow rate. The new dust collection system must meet or exceed the recommended exhaust flow rates for each woodworking machine as defined by the ACGIH.  The new dust collection system must also reduce the amount of exposure to airborne hardwood dusts in the Equipment Room to below the ACGIH Threshold Limit Value for hard wood dusts (1.0 mg/m3).

B. Post-Award Design Solution-

The Contractor will develop a full design package, based on the simple diagrammatical sketch(s), which shall contain detailed drawings and specifications that show the new proposed ductwork, equipment, and any foundation or structural work required and must be within all requirements of this Statement of Work (SOW).  The Contractor shall submit the completed design drawings and specifications to 90 CONS for review, prior to installation, for acceptance.  Following this review, the Contracting Officer will issue a Notice to Proceed (NTP), for Phase III.

PHASE III:  INSTALLATION-

The main duct will run from the dust collector/blower unit to the attic through an existing opening, and will divide into several branches in the attic area which is directly located above the equipment room.  Most of the ductwork will be located in the attic in order to minimize the noise in the equipment room.  Individual ducts for each machine will then run from the branching ducts down through the ceiling at locations near the individual equipment.  

Most of the machines in the equipment room have pre-existing adapters for the dust collection system.  The jointer (equipment # 15) and the lathe (equipment # 19) do not have adapters; installation cost must include purchasing and installing adapters for these two machines.  If new adapters must be used with the new dust collection system, the contractor must specify which machines need them in the design and include each adapter in the offer; this will be identified as a sub-line item to Installation.

The sheetrock ceiling joints are identified as an asbestos containing material (ACM) reference Attachment 3, which will be e-mailed upon request.   Base personnel (trained to work around asbestos/lead based paint materials) will cut the necessary penetration holes in the ceiling to accommodate the designed new ductwork. Contractor personnel will avoid disturbing the sheetrock material during the process of system installation, to prevent exposure to asbestos.  Lead based paint has also been detected in the building and it is the intention of the base to abate any lead based paint that poses a contamination threat (Attachment 3, to be e-mailed upon request).  The Contractor shall read Attachment 3 and notify 90 CONS if it is suspected that other installation processes are anticipated to disturb either lead based paint or asbestos.  Base personnel will perform all required abatement.

PHASE IV: DEMOLITION/DISPOSAL-

Offerors are to develop a quote that includes demolition and disposal of the existing dust collection system as a separate line item.  Contractor personnel will avoid disturbing the sheetrock material during the process of demolition, to prevent exposure to asbestos and lead based paint.  

(End of SOW)

DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION-

Delivery, Installation, and Demolition/Disposal must be completed 60 days after issuance of NTP.  

INSTALLATION-

Quote shall guarantee all required items.  Equipment shall be installed IAW manufacturers specification and certified upon completion.

TRAINING-

Contractor shall provide on site customer training for the dust collection system.

WARRANTY-

All items and work must be warranted for one year or as stipulated by manufacturers warranty.

SCHEDULED SITE VISIT-

Each offeror is highly encouraged to attend the scheduled site visit to be held at 0930, 4 March 2004. Offerors will meet at Gate 1, the Visitor Control Center, promptly at 0900, in order to be escorted to the appropriate facility to start the site visit.  Schedule for the site visit will be announced at this time.  Each offeror shall provide proof of vehicle insurance and a current drivers license.  It is recommended that offerors contact Ms. Mary J. Abbott, (307) 773-4752/ FAX (307) 773-4161, one (1) day prior to the site visit so we may have a body count of individuals attending.

EVALUATION FACTORS-

The government will evaluate the offeror’s ability to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions and representations and certifications, in addition to the factors to be eligible for award. Civil Engineering will evaluate the quotes based on the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards described in the SOW.

EVALUATION CRITERIA-

(1) General:  The objective of this solicitation is to obtain a source capable of performing, investigative design, design installation, and demolition/disposal IAW the Statement of Work (SOW), FE Warren AFB, WY.  Two evaluation factors will be considered: design and price.  

(2) Award without discussion:  The government may make a final determination as to whether the offeror’s quote is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the initial quote as submitted.  Accordingly, offeror’s are advised to submit initial quotes that are fully and clearly acceptable without additional information or explanation and contain the offer’s best terms.  However, the government reserves the right to conduct discussion if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Please be advised that the competitive range, if required, may be reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306(C)(2).  

(3) Basis for Award:  The award of any contract as a result of this effort will be based on an integrated assessment of each offeror’s quote against the evaluation factors identified.  In addition, for a quote to result in a contract, the quote must meet all RFQ requirements other than those identified as factors.  Award will be made to the offeror who the government determines can best satisfy the requirement set forth in the solicitation in a manner most advantageous to the Government (Best Value).  

(a)	BEST VALUE

This acquisition will utilize BEST VALUE for the award decision.  “Best Value” means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  Technical Acceptance is equal to price.  Technical Acceptance may be traded off against price, as addressed in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 (a).  The application of BEST VALUE in contract award and selection and approval process is as follows:

1.	All offerors will be rated based on technical acceptance and lowest price.  
2.	The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest evaluated price offeror and award to a higher priced offeror with a better technical acceptable solution to the Request For Quote.  The contracting Officer shall make an assessment of the price proposed and the technical acceptability of the offer to determine the best value for the Government.

(b) BEST VALUE ASSESSMENT

1.	Best Value will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.101.
2.	Submitted design to include layout for each identified machine equipment will be technically evaluated by the technical team and rated.  Each design will be rated as either “acceptable” or “not acceptable.”  Evaluations will be based on the offeror’s proposed solution to the dust collection problem within the Skills Development Center.
3.	Technical Acceptance: (a.) Design:  Must have a minimal affect on the historical aesthetics of the building.  Design must also have minimal affect on asbestos and lead base paint surfaces.  (b.) Equipment:  A brief narrative describing the equipment type, manufacturer, and main specifications of the dust collection system proposed to be installed.
