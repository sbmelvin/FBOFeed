<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the American Hospital Association, Washington, D.C.  The purpose of this project is to procure the assistance of the American Hospital Association to (1) identify, discuss and provide timely input to HRSA on ESAR-VHP development and implementation issues for hospitals, (2) identify possible solutions or options for addressing the hospital issues and (3) provide timely input into the development, testing, implementation, and refinement of ESAR-VHP Guidelines and Standards.  The anticipated contract life is for a twelve (12) month period.  The American Hospital Association is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required services as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 because it is the only entity with the established membership and affiliations that are essential for performing this work.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file. This is not a solicitation but an announcement of the Government’s intent to contract.

The statutory authority for this procurement is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR6-302.1.

The purpose of this contract is to purchase the following commercial items and services:

This modification to the NASADAD Contract will conduct an inventory of State Incentive Grant (SIG) products, to include State wide evidence-based prevention plans, publications, curricula, web resources, etc.  This inventory will serve as a mechanism to identify what SIG products have been developed and how to locate them.  This inventory will assist States in their planning for and implementation of the new Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) SIGS and the Performance Partnership Grants (PPG)s.  These two grant programs will be better able to become one evidence-base prevention system, as the performance measures are the same for both SPF SIGS and the PPGs.  We believe this activity successfully fits into the NASADAD contract under Task 3:  Performance Partnerships, as States begin to implement these new CSAP initiatives.

The proposed procurement is for commercial items and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6-302.   This synopsis is not a notification or request for competitive proposals. The Government reserves the right to enter into a competitive acquisition if it is determined that it would be in the best interest of the Government to do so.   A determination by the Government to proceed with a single source procurement based on responses to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received in response to this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to proceed with a competitive acquisition. The Government anticipates releasing the RFM on or about June 12, 2004 with a closing date of July 19, 2004.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Kongsberg Satellite Services of Tromso, Norway to procure Synthetic Aperture Radar  Images

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Washington Detachment, intends to award a sole-source contract to Kongsberg Satellite Services of Tromso, Norway to procure Synthetic Aperture Radar  Images.   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is the only high-resolution data source capable of penetrating the perpetual cloud cover and illuminating conditions unique to the polar regions.   This equipment helps the Naval Ice Center’s (NIC) continue their mission to provide worldwide operational sea ice analyses forecasts for the armed forces of the Department of Defense, Allied Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Transportation and other U.S. government and international agencies.  Use of the SAR data to monitor conditions for the region is essential.   The SAR Radar Satellite (RADARSAT) is the first satellite designed for operational sea ice analysis.  Its C band (5.3 GHz) HH polarized SAR sensor provides complete Arctic coverage at 100 meter resolution.   The SAR ‘s  beam steering capabilities allow coverage over a 500 km swath at 100 meter resolution.   Current technology allows creation of ice classification, concentration and motion products, which greatly aid in production of a wide variety of ice information and decision making products.  The Kongsberg International Satellite Station has limited on-board recording capabilities that allow the satellite to “see” ground stations and to download the imagery.   The Kongsberg ground station located in Norway is also an ideal location for NIC to collect resolution data for the polar regions.   A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared.  The period of performance is anticipated to be from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005, with four (4) one-year options.  The SIC Code is 4899.  See Note 22.  Solicitation number N00600-05-R-0003 will be available approximately 9 June 2004 and can be downloaded from http://www.neco.navy.mil.

Atlanta Cognitive Interviews:  Pre-testing of the redesigned SUIDIRF using cognitive interviewing methodology.  SESRC will pilot test the revised SUIDIRF in August 16-18, 2004 in Atlanta, Georgia.  Approximately 9-12 cognitive interviews will be conducted, with medical examiner, coroner, death scene investigator and parent pairs, using the revised SUIDIRF. 

Three cognitive interviews will be scheduled per day so as to allow 2 to 3 hours per interview. Each interview will need at least 60 minutes and 30 to 45 minutes for the individual debrief about the SUIDIRF.  Then, SESRC will need about 30 minutes to debrief for themselves and make notes after each set of interviews. 

Participants will be given a “token incentive” of $100 for their time in participating in the interview.  The cognitive interviews will each be video recorded using SESRC equipment.  The interview participants will be asked to “think aloud” during the interview when they have difficulty with any wording, concepts or definitions. Additionally, the SESRC staff will observe the interview and document interactions using behavioral coding.  Specifically, the interview will be critiqued while it is on-going for: awkward or inadequate question wording; respondent probes and asked for clarifications or definitions; and coroners adlibbed or undocumented probes.   At the end of the interview, respondent and medical examiner/coroner/death scene investigator and parent pairs, will each be interviewed separately for their impressions of the interview, for problem questions and concepts, and debriefed specifically for parts of the SUIDIRF that appeared to be difficult or unclear during the interview.

Assessment objectives
The list of assessment objectives for cognitive interview behavior coding, debriefing, and the final tape review would determine:
1.	Are there words that are misunderstood?
2.	Are questions interpreted the same way by all respondents?
3.	Are there responses that are not captured by this form?
a.	Do close-ended questions have sufficient pre-coded responses?
b.	Are there adequate spaces for fill-in the blanks and other text responses?
4.	Are there any questions that are skipped or missed often?
5.	Is the form user-friendly? Too cumbersome?  Biased?  How can the form be improved?

6.	Detailed reactions to each question on the form.
a.	Ask each respondent for comments and criticisms about the questions.
b.	Ascertain reasons for responding “don’t know” or “unknown”.
c.	Find out why items were left blank. 
d.	Note criticisms and concerns regarding each question.
e.	Identify questions that are offensive, hard to understand, or do not elicit the information that the question was intended to ascertain.
7.Detailed reactions to each section and format of the form.
a.	Ask for comments and criticisms about the sequence in which questions are asked. 
b.	Identify any awkward sequencing of items.
c.	Ask for comments about the grouping of questions.  Are they logical groupings?  Are section titles appropriate?
d.	Would another format or style make the form more user-friendly (e.g., tables, check lists, etc.)?
8.Record the length of time in minutes needed to complete the form

SESRC equipment description
SESRC has professional quality video and taping equipment for use in on site cognitive interviewing and testing and includes: a Cannon GL1 3-CCD digital video camera and a Sony handheld video recorder to collect form testing data.  These digital images are then downloaded to an iMac computer and edited using Final Cut Pro video editing software.  Video images are further transformed and enhanced, by specially trained technical personnel, using Sorenson Squeeze compression software to record each interview to a standard DVD formatted disc.
Deliverables
SESRC deliverables from the Atlanta cognitive interviews will include: an edited video report, a written summary of findings and recommendations from assessment of cognitive interviews. The summary reports will describe the results in terms of behavior coding of on –going cognitive interviews, summary of parent and examiner debrief after interviewing for up to 12 cognitive interviews where an examiner is partnered with a parent for each interview.  An example dataset and SAS listing from completed questionnaires (n=12) will be provided to evaluate: non-response items, sufficiency of categorical and numeric questions, and thoroughness of written open ended text questions occurring during interview.   SESRC will revision and reformat the SUIDIRF following cognitive interviews.  Due date for deliverables to CDC is September 1, 2004.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research of North Carolina to provide regular updates to a software system that identifies physicians located in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) who are eligible for HPSA bonus payments.  

Sections 413(a) and 413(b) of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 require revisions to the current HPSA bonus process.  Currently, Medicare carriers pay the HPSA bonus based on the inclusion of a modifier with the service when it is billed.  Designations of the HPSA bonus areas are based on determinations of primary care and mental health rural and urban whole and part county geographic HPSAs made by The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  These designations may be by county, census tract, township, etc. Based on the legislation that policy will be revised to no longer require the modifier for services rendered in zip code areas that fully fall within a designated HPSA area or are classified as dominant according to the United States Postal Service (USPS).  Services provided in areas that are eligible for the bonus, but do not fully fall within a HPSA bonus area, must still be submitted with the modifier.  In order to pay the physician bonus, The Centers For Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide to the Medicare carriers and standard systems lists of the zip codes for which the bonuses may be paid.  Under an existing contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research developed a product to identify zip codes for which physicians will automatically be eligible for bonus payments.  

CMS intends to issue a sole source contract for the continued support of this system.  Under this contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research will be required to provide regular updates to the product that can easily be utilized by the Medicare standard systems and carriers and also be added to the CMS website, as well as develop a process to test the zip code files to verify that the zip codes are correctly linked to the geographic areas.  It is imperative that CMS have a contractor that has total knowledge of the development of HPSAs as well as the geography of both HPSAs and ZIP code areas, experience with the relational file structure of the HPSA designations and corresponding Geographic Information System (GIS) files, how each is defined, and how each changes over time.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 1 year with four optional years.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence.  The Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to Growth Dynamics of Holyoke, MA.  Since August 1998, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Leadership Council and the CFSAN Management Council have worked closely with Growth Dynamics, Inc. to assess and identify issues and needs and to recommend improvements which would enhance the day-to-day work activities and environment.  Growth Dynamics has held a number of retreats and working sessions which focused on leadership changes, decision-making processes, teamwork and the establishment of priorities.  All of this has helped CFSAN to (1) enhance the overall effectiveness of the organization, (2) achieve its established program priorities, (3) raise productivity, (4) empower employees at all levels, and (4) improve employee morale.  The purpose of this purchase order is for Growth Dynamics to continue to build on its previous work with CFSAN and to conduct organizational assessments to identify issues and needs and to recommend changes which would improve work processes.  This is not a formal request for quotes.  However, the evaluations of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  The sole source procurement is being awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>It is the intent of the NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL to solicit and award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract of less than $500,000.00 for a five month period of performance to Northrop Grumman (NG) Defense Mission Systems, (55 John Clarke Road, Middletown, RI), under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), set forth in FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), titled, “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”.  The Government intends to award an analysis and design task for a software Tactical Data Link – Desk Top Training System (TDL-DTS) to facilitate training on the following systems: Aegis Weapon System (AWS) baseline 5.3.8 and 7.1 TIC, IDS, TRK SUP, CDLMS, KG-40, URC-107, SSDS MK 2, USQ-125, USQ-120, LMS-16, LMS-11, USQ-86, and MIDS.  

This sole source award is based on the following: 

1.  Technical Risk: The Navy plans to leverage development from previous NG products, specifically AWS baseline 5.3.8 Generic Re-Configurable PC Based Training System (GRTS) software developed for Surface Warfare Officer’s School to realize substantial future development cost avoidance.  Additionally, this system when developed must be interoperable with existing GRTS software, and NG is in a unique position to develop the Software Design Document to operate on the CTTAS simulation engine, a NG Licensed product.   2.  Subject Matter Expertise.  NG has performed research on this topic in the past.  They possess a large body of Subject Matter Experts to write AEGIS training scenarios for the U.S. Navy.  They also possess instructional design specialists and subject matter experts that are already familiar with the systems and the requirements of the customer.  This expertise is critical to meet the required delivery date for completion of this effort. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to develop the required product in the time specified. 

Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to Marcia Coleman, 407-380-4092, not later than 071904,  3: 00 P.M. local time.   Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated  for the purpose of determining whether or not a company is capable of performing the effort within the required time and to determine if this procurement can be conducted on a competitive basis.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Northrop Grumman Corporation will integrate the RSTA algorithms within the current ASTAMIDS processing scheme to extend the role of the ASTAMIDS.  The integrated ASTAMIDS and RSTA must not affect  the basic ASTAMIDS parameters and performance.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsib le sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required ASTAMIDS RSTA/LD functionality improvements may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages.   The resultant contract modification will be cost plus incentive fee.

<SUBJECT>B -- Integrating Transportation Network Data Into Predictive Models For Invasive Species Project

INTEGRATING TRANSPORTATION NETWORK DATA INTO
PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR INVASIVE SPECIES PROJECT.  Statement of Work referenced in original notice is as follows: STATEMENT OF WORK
INTEGRATING TRANSPORTATION NETWORK DATA 
INTO
PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR INVASIVE SPECIES PROJECT


BACKGROUND: Cornell ecologists estimate that the total costs of invasive species in the United States amount to more than $100 billion each year, including damage “from alien weeds  (cost: $35.5 billion) and introduced insects ($20 billion) to human disease-causing organisms ($6.5 billion).”   Our transportation network plays a role in amplifying this damage by allowing the movement organisms into new areas, providing them the opportunity to greatly expand their range.  For example, the Asian long-horned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, invasions likely originated from wooden packing materials used to ship goods from China,  and Brown Tree snakes, Boiga irregularis, in Guam is believed to have been introduced by military cargo planes and ships during World War II.  

Traditionally, work to prevent invasions begins well after a species has taken hold in a new area, necessitating expensive physical removal of the invading organism.  In some cases, species become so well established that removal is impossible.  This study seeks to move the Department’s efforts to address species invasions from being reactive to being proactive.  By predicting where species are most likely to invade, and then predicting what transportation routes would allow for such an invasion, transportation officials should be able to more effectively prevent new invasions through precisely targeted measures.  A proactive approach should lower costs and could potentially prevent costly invasions of undesirable species.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This study seeks to enhance the predictive capacity and the transportation-decision utility of existing invasive species models through the addition of transportation system information.  Such models include the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) or the Spatially Explicit Individual-Based Simulation (SEIBS) type models.  These models have not typically included a transportation element to account for species spread, but the addition should be technically feasible and could enhance the model’s usefulness.

The current method of responding to invasive species in transportation relies on early detection and subsequent removal, but such a strategy is reactive and may allow time for the species to become established.  Modeling the potential distribution of a species based on characteristics of its ecological niche or other criteria is proactive and may improve our ability to prevent species invasions. 

Deliverables:
•	An adapted model or methodology for including transportation information in invasive species modeling.
•	Written report suitable for publication by DOT, including annotated bibliography.
•	Two briefings for DOT officials, one at project onset and one upon completion.
	
Elements:
•	Technical feasibility, i.e. potential for this type of approach.  Should include discussion of which models, species, and decision makers would be most likely to benefit.  Should outline additional applications for this type of approach.
•	Modeling application.  The modeling aspect of final product could be in the form of a transportation network module for a specific modeling application, or a modeling application that will complement existing model output and existing DOT GIS capabilities and resources.
•	Proof of concept work that involves application of transportation system data to predictive models for a variety of plant and animal species.  This work should include a variety of modes - Maritime, Aviation, Highway, or Rail.  The project should also include potential actions to reduce the risk of species invasion based on the proof of concept work. 
•	Plan to share information regarding the application of this technique, in order to allow others to do similar analysis on additional species.

PROJECT LENGTH/TIMEFRAME: 8-12 Months

APPROACH: This statement of work will be published in the Commerce Business Daily.  Offerors who show interest in the project will receive an openly solicited Request for Proposal (RFP).  Final project selection will be based on the responses received under the RFP.

<DESC>Change Presolicitation Notice to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation; end item is for a written report; purchase order will be issued with a firm-fixed price as lump sum. The following Statement of Work is corrected for format purposes only:

 

The purpose of this statement of work is to evaluate the use of a geothermal heat pump system for survey for HQ AETC.  The geothermal system would implement a vertical closed loop heat exchanger.   A preliminary geological lithology log model will be simulated using available data from the state and other geological organizations to create a model.  The model will show the following:

  (1) the types of materials expected to be encountered 
  (2) an estimated average thermal conductivity for a 350’ vertical well based on those materials 
  (3)an average estimated static earth temperature across the well depth
  (4)thermal diffusivity for that same vertical well
 
METHODOLOGY:

The software used for simulating geological conditions is:Rock Works; Micro-Soft, Excel 

A professional Geologist has also been used to evaluate the lithology of the formation on site and evaluate the estimated thermal performance of the soils at different strata and the composite performance for the vertical closed loop.  He will also determine the estimated Static Water level and trends in its stability or effects on the thermal conductivity results.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility of a small business.  NFEC Southwest intends to award more than two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity small business contracts.  

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contracts include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.

It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $60,000,000.

<SUBJECT>F -- PREPARATION OF NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT PLANS IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA
<SOLNBR>NRCS-10-VA-04
<RESPDATE>072104
<CONTACT>Denise Darby, Contract Specialist, Phone 804-287-1630, Fax 804-287-1734, Email denise.darby@va.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Virginia announces a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the preparation of nutrient management plans.  The process will involve meeting with farm operators and developing plans for the applications of nutrients in the form of commercially obtained fertilizer and/or animal manures.  Proposals are sought for two areas in Virginia which are:

Service Unit Area #1 consisting of the counties of Frederick, Clarke, Warren, Shenandoah, Page, Rockingham, and Augusta.

Service Unit #5 consisting of the counties of Westmoreland, Northumberland, Richmond, Lancaster, Middlesex, Mathews, Gloucester, Essex, King and Queen, King William, Hanover, Henrico, New Kent, Charles City, James City and York.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

Nutrient management plans are required by NRCS as a component of conservation plans developed to the Resource Management System (RMS) level of treatment and as a component of a Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan (CNMP) to address conservation needs of livestock operations.  Nutrient management planning requires a field visit and discussions with the producer, current soil test information (less than three years old), yield results, field specific information on environmentally sensitive information, calculations of soil loss and P-Index if animal manures or bio solids are used on the tract, appropriate analyses of manure or organic nutrient source, development of a plan document and delivery and explanation of the plan to the producer.  All nutrient management plans must be consistent with other conservation practices planned for the tract.  Consultation with NRCS to review planned conservation practices will be necessary to insure consistent recommendations to the producer.

For all fields receiving animal manures or biosolids, a field risk assessment will be performed in accordance with NRCS Nutrient Management Standard #590.  The planner will evaluate the current soil test results to perform this risk assessment.  If the soil test results indicate a phosphorous level less than twenty (20) percent saturation (Mehlich 1 test), the planner will be allowed to base organic fertilizer recommendations on the nitrogen requirements of the desired crop.  If the soil saturation level is greater than sixty five (65) percent (Melich 1 test), no additional phosphorous applications will be allowed.  For all soil test results between twenty (20) and sixty five (65) percent, the planner will be required to calculate the desired target application level by the use of the Phosphorous Index.  The current version of the P-Index for Virginia (developed by Virginia Tech) will be the only acceptable methods.  If an updated version is released during the contract period, all new plans currently not started will be completed using the new version.

Plan format and content will be consistent with providing all information necessary to meet Commonwealth of Virginia Nutrient Management regulations 4 VAC 5-15-140 (Nutrient Management Plan Content).  The use of state developed nutrient management software is encouraged but not required.  The use of GIS produced field maps is permitted. All plans will be signed by a nutrient management planner certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia.  In addition, all plans will be signed by the producer indicating that the plan has been developed, delivered, and explained.

It is estimated that plans will be written for approximately 15,000 acres.  The government contemplates the award of one or more multiple firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  Tasks may be directed based on qualifications of the firms.  Firms will be permitted to submit proposals for single counties listed within the Service Unit Areas as well as all counties listed.  It is anticipated that the contract period will be from contract award through September 30, 2005.  This will be a performance based service contract.  The government shall place orders totaling a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $150,000. Task orders will be negotiated for individual plan development on individual tracts, but the task order may cover multiple tracts for the same individual.

The person signing the plan must be currently certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Conservation and Recreation Nutrient Management program and prove experience in developing nutrient management plans.  A sample plan indicating prior performance is required in the RFP submission.  In addition, consideration will be given to the amount of planning (acres) a prospective firm indicates can be achieved in the contract time period.  
    
Firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in descending order of importance.  (1) Price (2) Specialized experience and technical competency in the type of planning required.  Evaluation will be based on the extent of directly related experience in developing nutrient management plans.  (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance.  (4) Capacity to accomplish the work.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel available to produce plans, the quantity of work planned and the schedule of completion.  (5) Past performance on contracts with other government agencies to develop nutrient management plans including the quality and timeliness of performance under previous contracts.  References with telephone numbers must be provided.  (6) Location in the general geographic area.  Firms or individuals must indicate the Service unit area, county or counties for which they would like to be considered.
 
The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690. All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract (www.ccr.gov).  In addition, prior to award all firms must be listed as a Technical Service Provider (TSP) for nutrient management planning.  For information go to http://techreg.usda.gov.  The Request for Proposal will be available on or about June 15, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors to respond to Invitation for Bid No. W912WJ-04-B-0011 for the Section 1135 Coastal Wetland Ecosystem Restoration Project, Allins Cove, Barrington, Rhode Isla nd.  Allins Cove is a small embayment of Narragansett Bay estuary about 21 acres in size.  About eight acres at the southern end of the cove were used as a dredged material disposal site during the dredging of nearby Bullock Point Cove in 1959.  The fillin g elevated the marsh and sub-tidal areas above the normal range of the tide.  Phragmites have colonized the filled area. Over time, the sand spit at the southerly end of the filled area has migrated north-northwest due to wave action.  Migration of the bar rier spit northward has displaced the tidal inlet northward toward Byway Road.  The shoreline next to Byway Road is eroding and eventually Byway Road and the adjacent salt marsh will be lost.  The work consists of restoring coastal habitat in Allins Cove b y excavating portions of the filled area, disposing of the excavated material in an on-site disposal area, realigning the tidal inlet, constructing a north sand spit along Byway Road, and reforming the south sand spit at the toe of the disposal area.  Exca vation and grading will be performed mechanically by conventional construction equipment using low pressure tires or tracks.  During marsh excavation, sediment runoff will be prevented by construction of silt fencing.  Some disturbed areas will be seeded w ith suitable coastal grasses in areas most susceptible to erosion.  Two osprey platforms will be constructed to increase nesting habitat.  The estimated cost of this procurement is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 2379 90 with a Size Standard of $17.02 million.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis and will be a firm fixed price contract. The estimated issue date for this solicitation is on or about 26 July 2004.  Prospective contractors and subcontractor s are required to self-register their firm or office on the Internet to receive the solicitation.  Registration instructions are available on the Internet at http://www.nae.usace.army.mil as well as the media by which the solicitation will be made availabl e.  Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at this Internet site.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted.  Those registering are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<DESC>ALLINS COVE IN BARRINGTON, RHODE ISLAND, IS A SMALL EMBAYMENT OF NARRANGANSETT BAY ESTUARY ABOUT 21 ACRES IN SIZE.  ABOUT 8 ACRES AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COVE WERE USED AS A DREDGED MATERIAL DISPOSAL SITE DURING THE DREGING OF NEARBY BULLOCK POINT  COVE IN 1959.  THE FILLING ELEVATED THE MARSH AND SUB-TIDAL AREAS ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE OF THE TIDE.  PHRAGMITES HAS COLONIZED THE FILLED AREA.  OVER TIME, THE SAND SPIT AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE FILLED AREA HAS MIGRATED NORTH-NORTHWEST DUE TO WAVE ACT ION.  MIGRATION OF THE BARRIER SPIT NORTHWARD HAS DISPLACED THE TIDAL INLET NORTHWARD TOWARD BYWAY ROAD.  THE SHORELINE NEXT TO BYWAY ROAD IS ERODING AND EVENTUALLY BYWAY ROAD AND THE ADJACENT SALT MARSH WILL BE LOST. THE WORK OF THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF R ESTORING COASTAL HABITAT IN ALLINÃ¢Â€Â™S COVE, BARRINGTON, RHODE ISLAND, BY EXCAVATING PORTIONS OF FILLED AREA, DISPOSING OF THE EXCAVATED MATERIAL IN AN ON-SITE DISPOSAL AREA, REALIGNING THE TIDAL INLET, CONSTRUCTING A NORTH SAND SPIT AT THE TOE OF THE DI SPOSAL AREA.   EXCAVATION AND GRADING WILL BE PERFORMED MECHANICALLY BY CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT USING LOW PRESSURE TIRES OR TRACKS.  DURING MARSH EXCAVATION SEDIMENT RUNOFF WILL BE PREVENTED BY CONSTRUCTION OF SLIT FENCING.   SOME DISTURBED ARE AS WILL BE SEEDED WITH SUITABLE COASTAL GRASSES IN AREAS MOST SUSPECTIBLE TO EROSION.  TWO OSPREY PLATFORMS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO INCREASE NESTING HABITAT.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Regents of the University of California, University of California, San Francisco, 3333 California Street, Suite 315, San Francisco, CA 94143.  The contract objectives are to: (1) maintain, monitor, and enhance a national, Web-based, learning program for providers of health care that relies on reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury as a result of health care and is modeled after the current AHRQ WebM&M; (2) advance learning about patient safety and provide CME, CEU, etc. as appropriate by healthcare professional category as it relates to cases presented in the AHRQ WebM&M; (3) improve patient safety by serving as a national resource on patient safety alerts, new evidence, and best practices/interventions for reducing the risk of patient injury/harm associated with the delivery of health care; and (4) serve as a national link to relevant patient safety resources in both the public and private sector.  The estimated period of performance is for 2 years with three 1 year option periods.  It is anticipated that the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) has been the Contractor for the AHRQ WebM&M since September 2001.  As such, UCSF has developed unique trust levels, skills in confidential transactions, professional relationships, and a successful, anonymous payment system to support this project.  Of particular value is the level of trust developed between UCSF and users of the site.  There have been no breaches in the confidentially/anonymity required to gather cases, work with those health care professionals submitting cases for review, and provide appropriate payment as incentives to submit usable cases.  The ability of the Contractor to provide these services in a confidential/ anonymous way are fundamental building blocks of this extremely successful program that provides readily available and actionable information for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety,  Without the Contractor's ability to carry-out these efforts in a confidential/anonymous manner, the program would fail.  The level of trust with a new Contractor would not be the same and would threaten the viability of this program which is a critical part of AHRQ's patient safety portfolio -- designed to help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.   Interested parties should fax a written request to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 5:00pm on July 23, 2004.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Subject

Request for Information (RFI) for a comprehensive data backup solution designed to provide reliable local data protection for the Enterprise Information Technology Services (EITS).

Background

Enterprise Information Technology Services (EITS) is the collective term used to refer to the integrated instantiation of three distinct, but interconnected, services within the USMC system domain:
·	Common IT Infrastructure (CII)
·	Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
·	Shared Data Environment (SDE)

Common IT Infrastructure (CII)
The CII comprises a disciplined and standardized hardware, software, and firmware baseline that forms the basis of the USMC IT Centers. The CII hosts a variety of database systems and applications. Its primary components are Dell Servers linked to a Symmetrix Storage Area Network (SAN).

Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
The COOP provides a comprehensive planning, infrastructure, and execution framework to prevent unacceptable loss of CII capability while continuing USMC business and processes. This capability is based on data transfer and replication over a dispersed geographical area and is distinct from the scope of the local backup requested in this RFI.

Shared Data Environment (SDE)
The SDE establishes the foundation for managing data in a net-centric environment. It directly supports a subset of the Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG-ES).

Description

In it entirety, EITS will provide the Marine Corps with IT Centers (ITC) offering the physical infrastructure, the storage, the software, and the services required to host USMC application systems and databases. This consolidation of computing power and storage in centralized and managed centers will furnish the Marine Corps with robust production, testing, and development environments, and with expert and comprehensive IT services.

From a physical standpoint, EITS will offer:
·	Storage Capacity on Storage Area Networks (SAN)
·	Network Bandwidth
·	Server Equipment
·	System Software
·	Electrical Power
·	Cooling and Environmental Systems
·	Physical Security

This baseline will host multiple database systems and applications in a custom N-tier architecture which will include load balanced servers, database clusters, and multiple application servers. Furthermore, EITS will provide the requisite administrative and management services to fully support the hosted systems. In particular, these services will include:
·	Cluster Management
·	Operating System Administration
·	Database Administration
·	Content Distribution
·	Server Load Balancing
·	Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)/Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP)
·	Advanced Monitoring and Reporting

Currently, there exist two EITS centers: site 1 at Quantico and site 2 at the Navy Annex.

Requirements

This RFI specifically seeks technical options for the implementation and deployment of a local data backup solution for EITS. For each such option the following information is required:
·	Option Description
·	Hardware Specification
·	Software Specification
·	Training Requirements
·	Cost Estimates
·	Schedule Estimates

Specifications

This section provides the high-level technical and functional requirements for this RFI. The proposed local backup solutions will need to be instantiated in two geographically separate sites with each site’s backup being completely independent of each other.

Quantitative Specifications Site 1

	Current	Expected
Data Storage	15TB	40TB
Backup Window	86400sec	86400sec
Throughput	174MB/sec	463MB/sec

Quantitative Specifications Site 2

	Current	Expected
Data Storage	15TB	75TB
Backup Window	86400sec	86400sec
Throughput	174MB/sec	868MB/sec

Qualitative Specifications

Platform		Architecture	
	Redhat Linux		SAN
	MS Windows 2000	Network	
	MS Windows 2003		Gigabit Ethernet
	HP-UX 11.x		Fibre Channel
	Solaris 7	Location	
	Solaris 8		Adjoining
	Solaris 9	Other	
	IBM AS400		Scalability
Hardware			Remote Access
	EMC Symmetrix		

It is imperative to clarify that the described COOP capability of EITS is outside the scope of this RFI and will remain totally separate from any option presented as a response to this document.

Any response has to provide a local backup solution for data protection and has to meet the presented quantifiable requirements and account for the qualitative ones.

Solutions that have been considered included tape library backups, disk backups, SAN mirroring backups, and combinations thereof. Responses may include any of these concepts or other original options or configurations.

Responders are encouraged to contact the Technical POC and make arrangements for site tours and for more information.

All communications must be in writing to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Christine M. Kuney, kuneycm@mcsc.usmc.mil

Please submit responses via email in MS Office compatible format by 07/30/2004, to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior intends to award a sole source contract to Enviremedial Services Inc of Oceanside, CA for the following services, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.   Required services are as follows: Background:  Naval Base Venture County needs full service cleaning, recycling and sediment collection for OWS.  A Transportable Treatment Unit (TTU) is needed to separate any hydrocarbons from the effluent located in the OWS, return the hydrocarbons to NBVC for proper disposal.  The effluent is then processed through the TTU and cleaned to a standard of less than 15mg/1 of oil/grease, and less than 30 mg/1 of total suspended solids (TSS).  The effluent processed through the TTU is then put back into the OWS thus reducing (approx. 75%) of the hazardous waste that would have been disposed of through Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO). Scope:  Naval Base Venture County needs services for the cleaning and recycling of water from oil/water separators.  The services include the removal of sediment from the separators and containerize it in drums supplied by Naval Base Ventura County.  The separators will be pressured washed and the clean recycled water returned to each oil/water separator.  Oil retrieved will be containerized and returned to Naval Base Ventura County for recycling or disposal through the base-recycling program. Place of Performance:  Point Mugu and Port Heueneme. Estimated Period of Performance - Base year and four one year options. Offerors who believe they can provide the above services are requested to send technical capability statements to the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, SW Branch, P.O. Box 12924, Fort Huachuca, AZ  85670-2924, FEDEX ONLY:  Augur & Adair Streets (Bldg 22208, 2nd Floor), Fort Huachuca, AZ  85613. Fax:  (520) 533-1600 or 538-0415.  Inquiries may be directed to Deborah Branham at (520) 533-1452.  See Note 22.

<DESC>THIS FEDBIZOPPS POSTING IS STRICTLY A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE THAT IS PART OF A TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SURVEY THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY; IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS OR PROPOSALS.

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland seeks to identify potential sources that currently can provide, or will soon be able to provide, commercially available, or soon-to-be commercially available, slap fingerprint segmentation software.  Such software may be selected by the Government to participate in the Slap Fingerprint Segmentation Evaluation 2004 (SlapSeg04), a government-sponsored technology evaluation of algorithms used to segment slap fingerprint images.

Note: Slap fingerprints (slaps) are also known as four-finger simultaneous plain impressions; slaps are taken by simultaneously pressing the four fingers of each hand onto a scanner or fingerprint card.  Slap segmentation is the process by which a single image containing four fingerprint images is divided into four images of the individual fingers.

Potential sources of such software will neither be funded by NIST, nor charged by NIST, to participate in SlapSeg04.  Rules for SlapSeg04 participants are outlined in the HOW TO PARTICIPATE page at http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.  A deadline for submission is shown on the CALENDAR page of http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis for the WFF Engineering Building NASA/Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) is seeking Capability Statements from interested small business contractors for the construction of a new two-story, 53,871 (gross) ft2 engineering facility.  The building will contain approximately 15,000 ft2 of specialized laboratory facilities and approximately 20,500 ft2 of office space for Engineering and Applied Technology personnel.  Laboratory spaces will accommodate the development and testing of electronics, microwave devices, computer hardware/software, mechanical prototypes, as well as space to be finished later as a clean room (class 100,000).  In addition, certain labs will be dedicated to the fabrication of metals, woods, plastics, and composites.  Requirements to be addressed in fabrication areas will concern dust collection, forklift access, ventilation, and noise isolation.	Requirements of concern in electronics laboratories will involve proper equipment grounding, electrostatic discharge, oxygen monitoring, and twenty-four hour temperature/humidity controls. In addition to addressing the technical requirements of this project, companies shall also display experience with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) principles.  The new Engineering Building is designed to meet LEED certification standards through a variety of means.  Some attainable examples in the design include, but are not limited to the following: large amounts of day-lighting on the interior of the facility; natural light in every office; raised flooring with floor-level heating and air conditioning; water-efficient landscaping; HVAC system controllability; and storm-water/erosion control management.  In addition to being a LEED requirement, the management of the erosion and sediment control plan must meet inspection criteria set forth by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality in the Virginia Pollutant Discharge System Elimination (VPDES), regulation number 9 VAC 25-180-10 et seq.  These requirements set forth standards for silt fencing, soil stabilization, and drop inlet protection.  VPDES requirements can be found at the following web address: http://www.deq.virginia.gov/vpdes/pdf/gpconstructswnew.pdf Construction of the new Engineering Building will occur near an operating research airport and adjacent to occupied facilities in a location central to campus activities.  Therefore, it will be necessary to operate in a manner that will have minimal impact on the daily operations of adjacent occupants.  This issue shall be addressed in the Capability Statement by identifying past efforts to minimize construction noise, to manage traffic concerns, as well as any other measures taken to curtail the impact of construction on the safety and operations of adjacent activities and personnel.        The Capability Statement shall consist of the following three sections: 1) Relevant Project Experience, 2) Specific Past Performance, and 3) Business Background.   1) Relevant Project Experience shall document a minimum of three projects (or portion thereof for subcontractors), that are similar in scope and complexity to the construction of the new Engineering Building, that are currently ongoing or have been completed during the last six years.  Part of this section shall describe the relationship of each project to proposed construction based on scope and technical complexities.  Reference information will be required from building owners that shall include name, address, point-of-contact, telephone number, and project dollar value. All positive and negative comments, criticisms, ratings, and awards received for these projects shall also be addressed.	 2) Specific Past Performance shall document all previous experience with the environmental and safety requirements stated above for LEED, Erosion and Sediment Control, and construction adjacent to occupied facilities.  This section shall document and display the experience necessary to fulfill the requirements beyond those dictated by the project’s technical scope.	 3) The Business Background description shall include the following: name of business/division; form of legal organization and year established; principal officers and organization chart; potential, on-going, or completed litigation; Government findings or sanctions at any level; a list of key subcontractors; a list of construction management personnel proposed for this project and their credentials.  This section should include a letter from the firm’s bonding company indicating the maximum aggregate bondability and the per-unit bonding amount (if the total is different from aggregate).  In addition, the Business Background description should contain a letter from the firm’s insurance agency indicating the ability to obtain sufficient liability insurance for a project of this magnitude (as indicated below).   Companies are required to provide four copies of the Capability Statement addressing the three main topics stated above for his/her firm, joint venture, partnership and subcontractors. Data requirements shall be the same for all companies.	Capability Statements shall be submitted and received in this office not later than close of business July 23, 2004 in order to be evaluated for consideration for this procurement. This is a Sources Sought synopsis. Award for this project is anticipated to be November, 2004.  NAICS code for this project is 236220. The size standard for this code is $28,500,000.  The estimated magnitude for this requirement is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Bonding requirements for this project will also range between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The Contractor will be required to provide proof of liability insurance substantially in excess of the minimum requirements.

<SUBJECT>NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR PLANT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST Next Generation Nuclear Plant SUMMARY The Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting the research, development, and design work for a Generation IV nuclear power plant that represents a significant advance over existing energy production technologies in terms of sustainability, safety and reliability, economics, proliferation resistance and physical protection. The Department is working with its international partners in the Generation IV International Forum to identify research and development activities that could enable such a technology to be demonstrated in pilot form before 2020. The base technology concept, the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), is an advanced, next-generation nuclear reactor coupled to advanced electricity and hydrogen generation technologies. The Department has developed a draft strategy, which is intended to stimulate private sector advice and information in advance of the Department's determination of mission need and funding availability for this effort. This approach is intended to elicit information to support the Department's future critical decisions in accordance with DOE program and project management directives. With this notice, the Department is soliciting comments from all interested parties including, in particular, those who have the capability and experience necessary to integrate activities associated with the research, development, design, construction, licensing, and operation of advanced technology nuclear facilities. In particular, the Department seeks private sector comments regarding the strategy outlined in this notice, including comments on the structure and financing of the project and its management. The strategy, outlined in this notice, is designed to maximize U.S. private sector and international (e.g., agents of countries that are members of the Generation IV International Forum) cost-shared participation in this effort, while also integrating the research work conducted at the Department's lead laboratory for nuclear energy technology development, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). One management and funding option that the Department would like discussed is the feasibility and effectiveness of entering into a cost-shared, cooperative agreement with a U.S. company (the "Project Integrator") to lead the formation of an international consortium for this project and execute the activities associated with this project. As noted in the Department's May 2004 final Request for Proposals for the management and operation of the INL, DOE has not made a final decision to construct a pilot NGNP facility. Should such a decision be made, final site selection will be subject to compliance with NEPA, other applicable laws and regulations, and the Department's project approval critical decision process. In all events, the Department intends that the INL would play a central role throughout the NGNP effort. Comments on this strategy should be received by DOE by July 2, 2004.  This has been extended to July 9, 2004 CONCEPTUAL PROJECT STRATEGY Overview The Department's objective is to conduct research, development, and demonstration of a next-generation nuclear power reactor in order to establish advanced technology for the future production of safe, efficient, and environmentally-acceptable power and to demonstrate the economic and technical feasibility of such facilities to the U.S. electric power industry. The Department contemplates the use of a financial assistance vehicle to enter into a cost-shared cooperative agreement with a U.S.-owned private sector organization (the "Project Integrator"). The cooperative agreement would be structured in a manner that allows the Department to evaluate, through the review of required deliverables, the programmatic and technical merit in proceeding to each phase of work. It is expected that the cooperative agreement, while relatively simple at the onset of the project, would grow in complexity as the Project Integrator develops an international consortium and proceeds through the various phases of this project. The Project Integrator would be expected to work with the Idaho National Laboratory to develop and manage research and development plans. The Department expects that most of its early share of the costs will be reflected in research and development led by INL. Tasks to be performed by the Project Integrator under the cooperative agreement would include: 1. Identify the best-in-class technologies that, when properly integrated, have the potential to meet the Department's system-level objectives. These objectives represent the technology goals for the first commercial plant. The Department recognizes that a pilot facility created as a result of this cooperative agreement may not meet these objectives, but should solve the following technical problems/challenges to allow the commercial facility to meet these goals: n Development of a system that can generate electric power at a cost of less than 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour; n Development of a system that can produce hydrogen at a cost of less than $1.50/gallon-gasoline equivalent; n Development of a system that will cost less than $1000/kilowatt to construct with a goal of $500/kilowatt. 2. Conduct a broad-spectrum evaluation of relevant technologies identified in the task above and defines an integrated technical baseline for the project. 3. Conduct a competition among technology vendors and select two organizations to develop design concept studies of their recommended technologies. 4. Conduct a detailed technical and economic evaluation of the two competing reactor concepts. 5. Recommend a single integrated technical, cost and schedule baseline that is the preferred of the two selected concepts, a concept based on an optimization of the two concepts, or a third, unrelated concept that the Project Integrator believes to be superior. 6. Establish the technical, cost and schedule baseline for the integrated reactor and hydrogen production facility. 7. Assemble an independent panel of experts (possibly through the National Academy of Sciences) to review the recommended technical, cost and schedule baseline. 8. Establish a business plan with required cost sharing from industrial and international partners. Intellectual property rights for all partners will be subject to DOE's statutes and regulations and international agreements as applicable. Intellectual property rights of parties to applicable International Agreements are governed by the terms of the International Agreement. 9. Develop a pre-conceptual design of the preferred baseline. 10. Develop a research plan to identify and address key technology issues requiring demonstration. 11. Develop a conceptual design. 12. Develop a detailed preliminary design. 13. Develop a detailed final design. 14. Obtain all Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing approvals. 15. Construct the facility. 16. Operate the facility for the purpose of demonstrating the technical and economic viability of the NGNP technology. DOE expects any agreement to cover all activities related to this project including research and development, design, licensing, construction and operation phases. The agreement also would address issues such as technology rights and private ownership of the NGNP capital assets. The Department expects to engage in negotiations with the Project Integrator to determine the level of cost-share required during each phase of the agreement to assure the success of the project while protecting the interests of the taxpayers. The Department anticipates that several competitively selected subcontracting partners will team with the Project Integrator to perform specialty work as the project progresses. Under standard DOE Intellectual Property policies and provisions, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) may be fragmented among prime contractors and subcontractors. In this regard, the Department seeks comments on how the Project Integrator would expect to manage IPR. DOE is willing to support the agreement with patent waivers and exceptional circumstance determinations, as necessary and determined appropriate by the Department, to assist the Project Integrator in consolidating and/or pooling the IPR. Furthermore, the Department may wish to obtain appropriate rights in contractor/subcontractor IPR to assure continuation of the project in the event of a contractor/subcontractor withdrawal. Evaluation Criteria The Department seeks comments on criteria that the Department may use in evaluating proposals for the competitive award of a cooperative agreement(s). These criteria could include (but may not be limited to) an applicant's demonstrated capability to: 1. Successfully manage and complete projects (especially nuclear projects) of similar size, scope and complexity within the past 5 years and provide qualified project personnel with demonstrated capability, experience and certifications; 2. Manage and integrate the research, development, design, construction, licensing and operation of the NGNP; 3. Manage projects within cost and schedule; 4. Objectively evaluate the attributes of competing technology concepts without conflict of interest arising from commitments to or financial interests in the corporate sponsors of those concepts; 5. Organize an international team capable of achieving the Department's objectives; 6. Negotiate all business agreements, including technology licenses, cooperative sub-agreements, and any other contractual instruments necessary to allow the construction and operation of the resultant design; and 7. Lead the commercial deployment of the resultant design in the United States. CONTACT INFORMATION The Department seeks public comment from all interested parties regarding its plans to enter into an agreement with a U.S. company to carry out the NGNP project. Comments are sought that address all aspects of the proposed strategy including any input regarding cost share, intellectual property rights, capital asset ownership, and evaluation criteria. A commenter should identify themselves, their company or organization, their interest in the project (e.g. environmentalist, potential consortium member, construction subcontractor, etc.), and contact point. In addition, U.S. companies interested in performing the tasks of the Project Integrator are invited to submit Expressions of Interest and comments on any aspect of the strategy detailed herein. Expressions of Interest shall be limited to 10 pages and include (a) the U.S. company's name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address, (b) a designated point of contact within the firm, (c) a statement of interest in participating in the NGNP program, and (d) evidence of the experience, technical and financial ability, and commitment to pursue the NGNP project. Confidential information contained within a submission should be identified and marked accordingly. The Department will protect confidential information to the extent permitted by law. Interested parties may submit their comments by e-mail or by regular mail to Trevor Cook, Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington DC, 20585, E-mail address: NGNPEOI@NUCLEAR.ENERGY.GOV. DOE may conduct one-on-one meetings with companies that respond to this request as a potential Project Integrator. The goal of one-on-one meetings would be to improve the companies' understanding of DOE's strategy and DOE's understanding of the comments provided. If DOE decides to hold one-on-one meetings, interested companies will be contacted. In formulating the strategy for the NGNP program, the Department will consider all comments received by July 2, 2004.  This has been extended to July 9, 2004. Disclaimer: The information obtained through this request for information will be applied in the implementation of the Department's formal acquisition process. This document, which is intended to elicit information and comments on the Department's strategy to develop the NGNP concept, does not represent a commitment by the Government to enter into a financial assistance instrument for the work described herein. Neither is this document intended as a formal solicitation of competitive financial assistance applications. No costs associated with responding to this Request or participating in any subsequent meetings will be borne by the Government.

<SUBJECT>76--Proprietary two-dimensional (2D) Seismic Reflection Data License.
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Concerns having the ability to furnish the following supplies are requested to give written notification, including, a telephone number for a POC to the acquisition office listed in this notice within 5 calendar days from the date of synopsis.  GENERAL:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for proprietary two-dimensional (2D) seismic reflection data license from seismic reflection datasets, and field data reproduction of digital data, geometry data, and observer's notes provided by Seismic Exchange, Inc. BACKGROUND:  Two-dimensional (2D) seismic reflection data are required to locate and characterized thrust faults located near Black Rock Dam to estimate ground shaking and surface faulting hazards associated with earthquakes occurring on these thrust faults and associated structures.  Based on the project's thrust faulting imaging requirements, minimum seismic reflection data requirements are as follows: (a) The seismic reflection data must have been acquired using field geometries suitable to image thrust faults beneath the Rattlesnake Hills and Yakima Ridge in the vicinity of Black Rock Dam and its reservoir's inundated area. (b) The seismic reflection data must have been acquired using a 24-fold or greater acquisition geometry with 2D receiver intervals not greater than a nominal 150 foot spacing and 2D source intervals not exceeding 300 foot spacing and total (correlated, when vibratory sources are used) time record lengths of 4 seconds or more. Nominal spacing is acceptable because sometimes receiver and/or source positions must be occasionally skipped to comply with local permitting requirements. Four seismic reflection datasets exist that might meet the above requirements and are available for licensing exclusively from Seismic Exchange, Inc.   Therefore, it is Reclamation's belief that Seismic Exchange, Inc. is the only source capable in providing the supplies based on the facts above.  This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall provide detailed data concerning their capabilities and may request to receive a copy of the solicitation when, and if it becomes available.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) BY SUBMISSION OF AN OFFER, THE OFFEROR ACKNOWLEDGES THE REQUIREMENT THAT A PROSPECTIVE AWARDEE SHALL BE REGISTERED IN THE CCR DATABASE PRIOR TO AWARD, DURING PERFORMANCE, AND THROUGH FINAL PAYMENT OF ANY CONTRACT, BASIC AGREEMENT, BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENT, OR BLANKET PURCHASING AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THIS SOLICITATION. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. Quotes are due by close of business 07/23/04 at the SW Idaho/Nevada Acquisition Center, 1249 S. Vinnell Way, Ste 200, Boise, Idaho 83709.  FAX quotes will be accepted at 208-373-4197.

PAST PERFORMANCE. 
The government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past 
performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the 
solicitation requirements.  In conducting the performance risk evaluation, the government may use data provided by the offeror or the offeror's references, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of relevant facts and circumstances. The government is seeking to determine whether the offeror consistently has demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices. 
By past performance, the government means the offeror's record of conforming to 
contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance, the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Past Performance ratings will be IAW AFFARS 5315.

PRICE. 

The price for each of the technically acceptable proposals will be evaluated for price reasonableness. The resulting award will be a firm fixed price contract. Offerors shall submit price in one lump sum amount.

AWARD.

The government will make an integrated past performance/price tradeoff assessment and award to the technically acceptable offeror determined to provide the best value to the Government. In other words, a technically acceptable offer other than the one with the lowest –evaluated price may be awarded the contract.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  FERC04C40371 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-23. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 541611.

Statement of Work: 
I. OBJECTIVE. 

As a result of the August 14th blackout the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is investigating issues that might contribute to enhancing the effective and efficient operation of the bulk power transmission grid.  The blackout investigation has found operator performance as one of the root causes of the August 14, 2003 disturbance, with deficiencies including lack of situational awareness, failure of personnel to declare an emergency and failure to take appropriate action to insure that the bulk electric system remained in a secure and reliable state.

The safe and reliable operation of the bulk electric power system in North America requires well-trained and effective personnel.  Historically, many utilities have used seniority as a primary determinant in the selection of power system operators, and relied upon on-the-job training to fill in the gaps in an individual’s experience.  As the grid has becomes heavily used, there is a need to identify and train for the basic skill set that an individual must possess in order to be considered for operating the power system.  

The FERC is seeking a highly qualified contractor to perform the services described in Section II.  The contractor shall prepare and submit to the FERC a comprehensive study addressing training, certification, licensing, and current practices for power system operators.  It is intended that this study will include identification of best practices for qualification of power system operators, identification of best practices for operator training in the electricity industry as well identification of training practices in other industries with requirements that are applicable to power system operator training. The study will include a gap analysis of any critical factors missing in today’s training programs and recommend minimum requirements for an operator training program.

II. SCOPE OF WORK. 

Specifically, FERC is interested in addressing all key operator training (and certification) issues raised within the interim and final blackout reports:
1.	Determine the breadth of current training practices across the bulk power system that is provided to system operators:
a.	Identify best-in-class training programs including areas such as re-certification, simulator training, required hours of training, emergency and normal operations training.  Consideration of U.S. and Canadian entities should be included.  Identify key areas, educational methods and training and certification approaches that are available.  Also highlight unsatisfactory training programs and document the characteristics that result in inadequate training. Consideration should be taken for the various control operations within the bulk power transmission system including Independent system operators, control area and Transmission operators, Regional reliability coordinators, etc.
b.	Identify potential obstacles that may prevent organizations from implementing and improving their training program, or hinder putting into practice procedures that are likely to enhance reliability.
c.	Identify minimum staffing levels to allow for adequate ongoing operator training and identify the amount of time being offered to operators across the system.  
2.	Identify best practices from other industries that could be implemented to better prepare power system operators.
a.	Consider training programs for operators in highly complex, high pressure industries such as military, air traffic system control, commercial and military aviation, and nuclear plants (NRC).
b.	Outline training and education materials and methods that are available including training metrics, types of training, content of training programs, required hours, refresher courses, minimum training requirements, training levels and certification grades, and re-certification processes.  
c.	Identify pertinent parallels to power system operations and identify training gaps and opportunities for improved training in the bulk power sector.  
3.	Develop characteristics of an effective power systems operator training and performance improvement program. 
a.	Identify functions within the bulk power system that would require training and certification programs. Functional areas requiring training and certification based on the NERC functional model would likely include – reliability authority, interchange authority, balancing authority, generator operator, transmission operator and market operator.   As part of the current training assessment, information should be collected pertaining to job tasks from existing data.
i.	Determine the needs of a power system operator – i.e. skills, attributes and knowledge that power system operators need and if appropriate define differences and similarities for training and certification requirements among functional areas.   
ii.	Determine minimum training requirements - including the appropriate amount of time for an operator to commit to ongoing training, certification and re-certification. 
b.	Recommend methods of conducting various types of training, e.g. seminars, computer based, on the job etc., based on tasks and responsibilities. This includes training programs for operations management, including their role during emergencies and should address incorporating lessons learned during real-time operation into training/ certification programs.
c.	Recommend the appropriateness of establishing grades or levels of operator qualifications from entry level to supervisor based on education, training and experience.   If levels of certification are deemed necessary, recommend criteria for each level.  
d.	Develop potential industry standards for acceptable power systems operator training.  The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)’s training program and the NERC readiness audits should be used as references.
e.	Recommend improvements and performance metrics for the NERC certification program and existing operator training programs.  This includes addressing operator and supervisor authorities and defining responsibilities and actions during non-routine events.
4.	Consider the merits for establishing two levels of certification including advantages and disadvantages of either a two-tier or one-tier process.  Consideration for the following two approaches should include:
a.	Generic level: tasks and responsibilities that are common across all interconnections would have a certification process.  Recommend requirements needed to understand the bulk interconnected system and how each system interacts with its neighbors.
b.	Regional level: Individual organizations would certify based on their own needs.  Determine what is needed for operators to competently perform local tasks and what organizational level might be appropriate to administer a second level certification examination process: i.e., Region, RTO/ISO/other organization.
Note:  The study recommendations must consider the requirements of industry standards for personnel training, continuing education, testing, and certification established by organizations such as:
i.	The International Association for Continuing Education and Training
ii.	American National Standards Institute
iii.	National Organization for Competency Assurance

Review Panel - A Review Panel may be established to provide direction and input into the analysis.  Additional responsibilities of the Review Panel may include participation in the kick-off meeting, provide comments on state of training in related industry; review and comment on draft reports and final deliverables; and assist in the implementation of recommendations from the final report. 

III. DELIVERABLES. Based upon the analyses, the contractor shall submit a comprehensive report to the FERC detailing items in Section II and setting forth recommendations and conclusions for operator training in the power system. All requested topics shall be discussed in the report, which shall be considered confidential until released by the FERC.  The contractor shall also complete and provide to the FERC staff an electronic copy of the report in Microsoft Word 2002 format.  Deliverables shall include a contract kick-off meeting with the FERC, a draft report, a briefing to FERC staff and review panel on the draft report, and a final report.  Throughout the study period, the contractor shall provide immediate notification to FERC staff of significant findings and important revelations.  The contractor will also be responsible for conducting weekly briefings with the FERC staff regarding the progress of the analysis.  Finally, the contractor will be available as an expert witness on behalf of the staff of the FERC in any hearings or meetings on applications.

IV. SCHEDULE. The offeror shall submit a schedule of deliverables including intermediate milestone dates.  The draft report shall be submitted to the FERC staff no later than March 1, 2005.  The report will be finalized with responses to FERC staff comments by March 31, 2005.

DIVISION 200 - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS

210   	EQUIPMENT
	
All equipment proposed to be used on the work shall be of proper type, sufficient size, operated at sufficient speed, and in such mechanical condition as to meet with the requirements of the work and produce a satisfactory quality of work.  Many areas have large standing dead pines, significant logging slash, large scrub oaks and/or slopes up to 15%. 
The contractor will be required to provide sufficient equipment to chop 50 acres per day.  A bulldozer will be required to pull choppers on Areas 10-13 because of the amount of dead trees on the ground.
Tractors must be equipped with protective canopies and fire extinguishers.  The COR may order the removal and require replacement of any unsatisfactory equipment.

	230 - Operational Specifications

	232 - Single Chop - Areas designated on maps and in the table above will be completely covered using a Marden B-7 or equivalent double drum offset chopper filled with water, with a gross weight of not less than 24,000 lbs. including water.  All brush and trees up to 6 inches in diameter (measured 4 1/2 feet above the ground) will be chopped unless otherwise designated.  Dead snags over 11 inches in diameter will be left standing. Smaller dead snags will be pushed down if needed to treat the area.
If a road goes through the chopping area, check the Area Maps to see if it is supposed to be chopped or protected.  If the road is not shown on the Area Map, it is not protected and should be chopped. 

	The chopper unit shall be no wider than eight feet unless approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  Choppers up to 10 feet wide may be authorized for use where they can be moved to the site without damage to trees alongside the roadway.  The angle between the front drum and the direction of travel must be at least 12 degrees.  The angle between the front drum and the rear drum must be at least 24 degrees.  The chopper unit must be pulled at an average speed of at least 3 m.p.h..  Each row of chopping must overlap the preceding row by a minimum of 6 inches.  Blades on the chopper drums must have the high-low configuration with the high blades alternating with the low blades on each drum.  Maximum difference in width allowed between high and low blades is 4 inches.  The cutting edge of the blades must be kept sharp and not exceed 1/4 inch in thickness.  COR may order the removal and require replacement of any unsatisfactory equipment, such as the cutting edges being broken or excessively dull.  Any unsatisfactory equipment must be replaced in 48 hours.


	240 – Schedule – Areas 10-13 (84 acres) must be completed by September 20, 2004 to allow time for ground to settle prior to planting. 
DIVISION 300 - Resource Protection
310 - Erosion Control - The contractor's operation will be conducted so as to avoid unnecessary soil erosion.  He will install and/or maintain drainage dips and water bars on skid trails and/or roads where designated by the COR.  He will perform the necessary erosion prevention work and remove any temporary structures installed by him which are no longer necessary to his operation.

	320 - Protection of Lands, Streams, Lakes and Reservoirs - The contractor shall prevent  pollution of streams, lakes, and reservoirs by fuels, oils, and other chemicals, silt, or other harmful materials.  He shall schedule and conduct operations so as to avoid siltation of streams, lakes, and reservoirs, loss of embankment material during high flow periods, and interference with movement of migratory fish.  All streams will be kept free of contractor-generated debris.  Contractor shall remove from National Forest land any trash, cans, etc. deposited as a result of contracting operations.

	330 - Site Protection - The contractor shall take every precaution necessary to prevent digging, gouging, and moving soil.  The contractor will prevent excessive rutting and compaction by operating his equipment only when suitable soil conditions exist (as determined by the COR).

	340 - Protection of Special Wildlife Areas – 	All areas may contain buffers painted on the ground around gopher tortoise burrows.  Do not chop inside these buffers but chop the painted boundary so no paint markings are left.  
	
	At no time will choppers be moved through or unloaded in a prairie or dry pond.  Movement along the edge of prairies may be approved by the COR.

	350 - Protection of Archeological/Historical Resources – The Contractor upon discovery of suspected archeological or historical materials, shall cease work in the vicinity of such material and immediately notify the COR.

	360 – Horse Trails – Areas 2 and 8 have a designated Horse Trail adjacent to or through the units. The Contract Maps indicate the location of the Horse Trails. The Horse Trail must be left clear of logging slash or chopped debris and trail marker trees will not be chopped or damaged. 

370 - Access - Tractor pulled choppers may be pulled only on roads designated on the area maps as access roads or as approved by the COR.  Short (less than 2 miles) tractor moves may be allowed along the sides of maintained roads if no damage to any type of tree will occur.

	When moving choppers from area to area, any negligent or willful damage to any standing timber that meets utilization standards will be charged to the contractor at a rate of $100 per CCF (double stumpage).

	When approved by the COR, equipment may cross Forest Service roads or use backslopes to gain access to a nearby area.  Road crossings over surfaced (limerock or clay) roads  will always require the use of tires to prevent penetration in the surfaced road.  Crossings are not permitted over paved roads.
	When moving on the gas pipeline road (FS Road 597) it is imperative that the choppers be pulled on the side of the road to avoid any contact by choppers within the pipeline corridor. There are two gas pipelines, each marked by a white post. The gasline could be as close as inches to the surface.  When crossing the pipeline, contractor will need to contact Florida Gas Transmission Company prior to crossing and they will come out, locate the exact location of the gasline, and advise on the best location and method to cross. Tires must be used to prevent ground penetration by the choppers on the pipeline unless not required or recommended by the Gas Company.

The estimated number of moves that will require loading the equipment between areas
is 5-6.

	380 - Protection of Improvements - The contractor shall take every precaution necessary to prevent damage to any improvements in the contract areas such as ditches, fences, landlines, signs, etc.  The contractor shall protect improved roads, ditches, fences and other improvements in the project area.  Improved roads (roads that have some sort of surfacing material) shall be kept free of all logs, slash, and debris.  Any improved road used by the contractor that is damaged by his operations shall promptly be repaired by him.

<DESC>Questions and Answers
1. Will you want to have IMAG for this event, or would you like on the SVHS and GFX to the screens?
No, just a standard DVD.

1(a)  To confirm....you do not want to see what the camera's shoot on the screens?  You only want the camera feeds to go to record?
Yes, you are correct.
 
2. Do you need DVD menu's programmed?
No
 
3. In your SOW, in section 8.5, you state that the room size is 46'X75' with 20' ceilings for the Empire Room.  However, when I looked up the dimensions on-line I noted that the hotel has the dimensions at 50'X111' with 11'7" ceilings.  Are you only using part of the room or should I refer to the hotels specs?

My error, please use the dimensions from the on-line hotel specifications.
 
4. How are you seating attendees for this event?
Rows of chairs facing stage divided with a center aisle.
 
5. In section 8.5 you have requested PCM microphones to be "aimed toward the pit".  Please define "pit".
Pit is defined as the location where recording equipment is set up (previous year contractor located it behind stage drape)
 
6. I am assuming that we will run the presentations for the presenter, is this correct?
No, each team will provide a person to advance slides during team's presentation.
 
7. Will you need any special packaging for the give away DVD's?
Each DVD should be marked with "Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award Presentation", date, team number, and the name of the team making the presentation enclosed in a DVD jewel case.
 
8. In section 8.5 you request "2 additional lights need for Q&A session".  Will there be a specific place that all questions will be addressed from or will attendees be able to ask questions from anywhere in the room?
Upon completion of the teams' presentation the entire team will come down off the stage and line up in front of the judge panel for the 10 minute question and answer session.

8(a)  For the Q&A would you like the judges and audience's questions to be on the recorded DVD or just the presenters?
Yes; however, the audience does not ask questions, just the judges and only the team members respond. 

9. Would you like to have the Q&A session recorded to DVD?
Each recorded session should include:
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) introducing team
Presentation (15 minutes)
Question & Answer Session (10 minutes)
Presentation of Coins by Judges to Team Members (approximately 5 minutes)
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) concluding the session
 
10. Do you have a specific location for the screens or is that up to us?
Two screens, side by side with approximately 12 inch space between, located directly behind the stage centered between the two podiums.

10(a). Do you want the same image to be on both screens?
This depends on the presenters.  In the past we have had teams that used one screen to show a PowerPoint slide presentation while a video ran on the other screen.
I would say; however, the majority of the teams present the same image on both screens.
 
11)  In Equipment 8.2, you refer to the number of people required to setup, operate and teardown equipment each day.  Under Security though, 8.6, you reference the Presentation room being locked each day.  Will the equipment have to be torn down and reset each day?  
No, you will not need to tear down the equipment each day.
 
12) Do you have a 24-hour hold on the room(s) with the Omni Shoreham?
Yes, we have a 24 hour hold on the room.
 
13) In section 3.4, you reference the presentation loads going on the computers. In order to determine staffing levels for the 5:30pm - 10:00pm timeframe, does all equipment need to be operated at that time, or just the computers and their displays. Please advise.
     Just the computers and their displays should be operated to ensure the presentations load        properly for display on the screens.
 
14) Will only graphics and VHS video be sent to screens? Will there be times that different images will be on each screen, i.e.-  graphics on one screen, while, VHS or camera on the other? Do we simply need to accommodate any mix of the above? Please advise.
This depends on the presenters.  In the past we have had teams that used one screen to show a PowerPoint slide presentation while a video ran on the other screen.  I would say; however, the majority of the teams present the same image on both screens.
 
15) Do you want the computer presentations switched to the DVD Record devices or is it only the cameras and the VHS playback? Please advise.
We want the presentations recorded on DVD, this includes:
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) introducing team
Presentation (15 minutes)
Question & Answer Session (10 minutes)
Presentation of Coins by Judges to Team Members (approximately 5 minutes)
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) concluding the session

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT

“Technical Assistance” for Advisory and Assistance Services by Non-Governmental Sources for Uzbekistan”

Project Title:  Uzbekistan:  Technical Assistance:  Contractor Selection for E-Government Implementation Plan and Taxation Pilot


1		Scope of Work

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

(1) Develop detailed selection procedures for the selection committee based on the criteria specified in the Request for Proposals for the E-Government Implementation Plan and Taxation Pilot project and the host country’s procedures for competitive selection; (2) travel to Tashkent, Uzbekistan with the proposals submitted by U.S. companies for the study.  The proposals will be delivered unopened to the Grantee in the sealed package provided by USTDA; (3) participate in the study selection process as an observer; and (4) prepare a final report to USTDA on the selection process.

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to verify with the COTR that the report is considered acceptable and ready for the production of the appropriate number of copies.  All reports must be paginated.  All reports must be submitted on a 3.5 inch disk in Microsoft Word.

In connection with travel, USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure.  The Contractor should contact the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure to brief and debrief them on the visit.   USTDA will request that the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet. Logistics for handling the visit, including hotel accommodations, transportation and translation services are also the responsibility of the Contractor.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit, and the proposed evaluation criteria for the selection committee.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Economic Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.  The Contractor shall contact the Economics Officer at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the report. 

3		Contractor Interim Status Reporting and Deliverables

The Contractor shall provide verbal updates to the COTR when necessary. The deliverables may also take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, interim and final reports, or other oral or written work products needed for successful performance.

4.1		Report Draft  -- COTR Approval 

The Contractor shall provide the report in draft form to USTDA for COTR review within ten (10) working days after completion of the overseas visit. The report should be clearly marked “Draft” on the cover.

4.2		Revised Report Draft – COTR Approval

Within five (5) working days after receiving the COTR’s comments on the draft report, the Contractor shall submit a revised copy for COTR review.  The Contractor shall revise the report as necessary until securing final COTR approval.  




4.3		Final Report – COTR Approval

The final report shall incorporate all mutually agreed upon material and revisions.   The report shall include any supporting documentation.  It shall be grammatically and factually correct in all respects, internally consistent, and all statements and tables shall be clear and easily understood by a competent reader, and contain no typographical errors.  Upon notification from the COTR that the report is considered acceptable, the Contractor shall submit twenty (20) copies, and one (1) unbound original to USTDA. All reports must be paginated and submitted in Microsoft Word on a 3.5-inch disk or on a CD-Rom.  The Contractor shall also submit the report to the COTR as an e-mail attachment, and also in Microsoft Word format.

5. 		Project Descriptions and Profile

In June 2003, USTDA provided a grant of $502,600 for a feasibility study to assist the Uzbek Communications and Information Agency (UzACI) in designing an e-government implementation plan and taxation pilot in Uzbekistan.   The plan would define the Government of Uzbekistan’s current information technology and organizational environment, and provide a sequencing plan for transitioning from the current to the targeted IT architecture, including coordination of government efforts, enhancement of networks and information systems, and development of new applications.  The pilot is to be located in Syrdarya, Uzbekistan, and is expected to focus on filing taxes online.

While the project is expected to attract many interested U.S. firms in the field of information technology, the Council of Ministers is relatively inexperienced with administering a competitive selection, and it is necessary to provide technical assistance in undertaking this process.
