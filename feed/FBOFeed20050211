<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source award to extend contract DTFA01-00-C-00036 in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 with Motorola to meet the current and future requirements of the Data Multiplexing Network (DMN) Program. The period of performance is 5-one year options April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2010. It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to continue to acquire these services from the contractor on a single source basis for the following reasons: Technical Expertise/ Cost & Schedule: For the past five years Motorola has provided technical expertise and experience systems engineering support to the FAA DMN Product Team on matters relating to system engineering and maintaining configuration management databases. The experience of key resources, test tools, and equipment dedicated to the DMN program under the Motorola contract has significantly reduced overall program costs and schedule risk.  These vital tasks currently performed by Motorola, require a thorough the development and understanding of the Data Multiplexing Network, extensive DMN Operations, Maintenance, and Network Management training, and expertise in all FAA telecommunications systems and most National Airspace System (NAS) programs.  No other company has acquired this knowledge and expertise. Therefore, the FAA intends to solicit, negotiate and award a single source contract modification to an existing contract with Motorola for five years of continued support of the Data Multiplexing Network (DMN) program. The Data Multiplexing Network (DMN) uses a variety of existing and emerging technologies.  Program Management Support, management of the expedite stock, long experience in managing network problems, logistics support for the equipment required to maintain the network Maintain an Expedite Stock at the bidders facility for the FAA to permit overnight replacement of equipment on an emergency basis. The efforts required in the planned contract include: operating and managing the network, validating and coordinating user requirements, preparing modeling analyses, maintaining Configuration Management (CM) databases, Provide for replacement of defective DMN Phase IIIB LRU's and related DMN Phase IIIB telecommunications equipment within 2 hours after initiation of a trouble call from the program Office, this includes the Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Develop and teach an attrition training course on the 9000NT Network management System.  Since the 9000NT system has evolved as fielding has occurred, training will be required to bring each ARTCC/CERAP to a common level of expertise.  In five years, DMN will be replaced by FTI and this effort will no longer be required.   This announcement is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any cost incurred by any party responding.

<DESC>The US Fish & Wildlife Service-Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurement to the M/V Exito dba or owned by Q & S Enterprises Inc to be utilized as a vessel platform to conduct liver biopsies on Threatened Stellar's Eiders and other sea ducks to assess injuries associated with recent the recent oil spill of the Selendang Ayu off the coast of Unalaska Island.  It is critical to document injuries to thereatened Stellar's Eiders before they begin migration to breeding grounds in March.  The Sole Source justification is justified in that the Exito is currently in Dutch Harbor and was used in initial response activities as a bird rehabilitation vessel.  This vessel is already outfitted with the stabilaztion unit and the crew is familiar with the procedures required for conducting bird captures.  The Exito is the only vessel available that can be used to conduct these preassessment activities immediately, before birds leave the spill impacted area.  Because of this time constraint and the need to collect ephermeral, fleeting biological information, it is not possible to obtain official competition.  However, all attempts were made in Dutch Harbor, AK to identify possible vessels that could be used for this study and the Exito was the judged the best option for the Service's needs.  The Exito had a crew experienced with wildlife operations and the boat was equipped for wildlife response. Other boats in the area had been used for oil spill response but did not have the wildlife capability and crew available in the area.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals or quotes received.  Award will be made 15 days after publication of this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

The planned tasking directs the contractor to maintain and support the two AMES, one micro-AMES, and two pico-AMES located at the 16 EWS and the 46th Test Wing (46TW) at Eglin AFB FL. It will also cover the nine CEESIMs that support the B-1, B-2, B-52, and F-22 test requirements. There is one CEESIM for each weapon system at Eglin AFB FL; one B-1 CEESIM at WR-ALC Robins AFB GA; one B-1 CEESIM at Edwards AFB CA; two B-2 CEESIMs at OC-ALC Tinker AFB OK; and one B-2 CEESIM at Lockheed Martin Owego NY. The AMES and CEESIMs are advanced radar environment simulator systems that accurately generate and simulate three-dimensional, complex emitter, high signal density, electromagnetic environments in real-time. They are used in the test facilities to support development and operational test requirements for electronic warfare (EW) systems. Both the simulators and the simulation software were designed and built by Northrop Grumman Amherst Systems, Inc. Tasking will include: (1) emergency repair and on-call maintenance of the AMES and CEESIM hardware and software (2) technical studies for and development of upgrades for existing hardware and software to overcome current limitations in test capabilities (3) system operation and maintenance training and (4) request for technical information. Due to the immediate need for support and the lack of adequate, existing support documentation, prospective contractors must have a prior and detailed working knowledge of the unique equipment and software involved. This must include knowledge in (1) the design, operation, and maintenance for the AMES and CEESIMs (2) the interface between the simulators and the Combat Air Forces (CAF) EW systems and their associated support equipment, and (3) the radar threat environments in which the CAF EW operates and their simulations using these simulators. The period of performance for the contract including the option is 01 Oct 05 through 30 Sep 15. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an IFB or RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Prospective contractors must submit evidence substantiating they possess the detailed knowledge and capabilities indicated above. The contractor must possess a TOP SECRET clearance and B-2 Special Access Required (SAR) access. Packages must be received by 2:00 p.m. CST, 29 March 2005. Forward qualification packages to: AAC/PKZA, Attn: Anne Weaver, 205 West "D" Avenue, Suite 467, Eglin APB FL 32542-6864. For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Mel Noble, (850) 882-6964 or E-Mail: melvin.noble@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, PARTS I AND ll, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. This proposed contract is an unrestricted procurement. Environmental planning services include, but are not limited to, preparation of environmental impact documents to support strategic forward basing initiatives and other projects, environmental studies of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and technical services related to such documents and studies. The term environmental impact document, as used herein, includes but is not limited to any Scoping Document, Record of Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Environmental Assessment (EA), Overseas Environmental Assessment (OEA), Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), Notice of Intent, Preliminary Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA), draft or final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Record of Decision (ROD), draft or final Overseas Environmental Impact Statement (OEIS), Environmental Review, general planning document or the requirements of other governmental agencies for which Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific (NAVFAC PACIFIC) may be tasked to provide environmental impact documents.  Some examples of projects could include home basing of aircraft, home basing of ships, new construction, renovation, demolitions, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. Also included under this contract scope are: (a) any preparatory work, presentation, briefing, consultation, study, or report which may be required prior to the initiation of any environmental impact document, (b) supporting studies for RCEs, EAs, Draft EISs and Final EISs such as flora and fauna studies; land management plans/studies; cultural (historic and archaeological) studies and consultations; noise, air and water surveys; traffic surveys; hazardous waste impact studies; socio-economic impact studies; wetland delineation and mitigation plans; environmental justice analyses; water quality studies (including chemical and physical analysis of dredge material and bioassays); public involvement strategies; life cycle cost analyses; land use compatibility plans; range hazard analyses; at-sea acoustic analyses; marine resource assessments; marine mammal density estimates; letters of authorization and incidental harassment authorizations; essential fish habitat assessments; and (c) general planning studies. Related technical services may include, but are not limited to, preliminary site assessment studies, feasibility assessments, and engineering services with associated multi-discipline A-E support as required. Examples include engineering investigations, concept studies, and feasibility assessments to obtain sufficient site data to determine the environmental impacts of a proposed action. A preliminary site assessment study may require additional analyses, including topographic, geotechnical, hazardous materials, and infrastructural (roads, drainage, electrical, water, sewage, etc.) aspects of proposed actions. The Government utilizes the following software suite, which conforms to the COMPACFLT Information Technology 21 Century (IT-21) implementation program: WINDOWS 2000 WORKSTATION, Microsoft OFFICE 2000 PROFESSIONAL (Word 2000, PowerPoint 2000, Excel 2000, Access 2000), Adobe Acrobat 5.0, AutoDesk’s AutoCAD 2002, and Internet Explorer 5.5. Additional multi-media electronic software applications required include, but are not limited to, the following:  Dbase (dbf), Oracle 8.i, AutoDesk’s AutoCAD 2000, Visual Basic, ESRI’s ArcView 3.2x or higher (SHP, SHX, SHB, DBF formats), ArcInfo Coverage Format, ArcSDE Format, ArcGIS Geodatabase Format, and HTML screens. Projects for which the A-E may be assigned work will predominantly be located in Hawaii, Guam, and other areas in the Pacific region under the cognizance of NAVFAC PACIFIC. Work may also be required in areas outside of the Pacific region under the cognizance of other NAVFAC components, or other governmental agencies for which NAVFAC PACIFIC is tasked to provide assistance. The nature of specific work assignments may require the A-E to obtain a secret security clearance. The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days from the meeting. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type where the work will be required on an "as-needed" basis during the life of the contract providing the Government and contractor agree on the amount. Each project will be a firm fixed-price task order. The Government will determine the task order amount by using the rates negotiated for the basic contract and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project. The contract base period shall not exceed twelve months or $40,000,000 total fee, whichever comes first. The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $56,000 for the contract. The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional four option years, for a total contract performance period of five years. There will be no further synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised. Estimated date of contract award is on/about August 2005. The NAICS for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services – average annual income for the past three years for small business classification is $4.0 million. Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The following selection evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications (e.g. education, experience, professional registrations) of the offeror’s staff in National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) environmental impacts analyses (studies, assessment and mitigation) for strategic basing initiatives (such as home basing of aircraft, home basing of ships, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions) for the U.S. Department of Defense, in particular, the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Area.  The professional qualifications of the firm’s staff will be weighted more heavily than that of the team subcontractors’ staff; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of the firm and its subcontractors in the application of Federal, State, local, and overseas regulatory requirements of the NAVFAC PACIFIC AOR to NEPA and other environmental impact analysis projects for strategic basing initiatives (such as home basing of aircraft, home basing of ships, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions), which include specialized studies, assessment, mitigation, and community involvement activities.  Specialized experience shall include, but not be limited to, air, noise, traffic, utilities, visual and aesthetic resources, socioeconomic, biological resources, cultural resources, and demonstrated familiarity and knowledge of the NAVFAC PACIFIC AOR.  The specialized experience of the firm will be weighted more heavily than that of the team subcontractors; (3) Method of operation and work production including: a) organizational structure, b) quality assurance plan, and c) ability to resource and manage a potential workload of four projects totaling $10 million at multiple locations under this contract, occurring concurrently, in addition to ongoing work for other clients; (4) Extent to which firms identify and commit to utilize small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB) and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) in the performance of this contract, whether as a prime contractor, joint-venture, teaming arrangement or subcontractor;(5) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (6) Location of the firm and its subcontractors in the geographical region in order to attend frequent face-to-face meetings in Hawaii and Guam and to address rapidly evolving requirements. Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part l, Section H. If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criterion (4), the government will evaluate proposals based on two subfactors: (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project. The offeror shall provide the following documentation in support of Subfactor (A): (1) Historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB. (2) Information on national awards received within the past three years for outstanding support to SB concerns, (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firm’s implementation of subcontracting plans (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protégé agreements under either the DOD or SBA Programs (5), Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javis Wagner O’Day Program and (6) Final SF 294’s on projects completed within the past 3 years. Lack of past performance data should be stated in the proposal. In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each sub-consultant by name, discipline and size status. The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB and WOSB, and 3% each to HUBZoneSB and SDVOSB. In addition, the NAVFAC PACIFIC FY 05 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 74.8% to SB, 15.6% to SDB, 13.92% to WOSB, 1.17 to HUBZoneSB and .12% to SDVOSB. The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZoneSB either as prime or sub-consultant, proposed SDB’s and HUBZoneSB’s must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZoneSB by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. For selection criterion (5), the Government will evaluate each firm’s past performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome. A-E firms shall provide their DUNS and ACASS number in SF 330, Part ll, Block 4. This solicitation requires all interested firms to have an email address.  Notifications will be via email, therefore, email address must be shown on the SF 330, Part l, Section B8. Large business firms who are short-listed will be required to submit a subcontracting plan before negotiations begin for contract award. A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a complete SF 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.

(e) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its  fault or negligence, such as acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting  Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the  cessation of such occurrence. (f) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall  immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges that  the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government, using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not  give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (g) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of  any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor  for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for  convenience. (h) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.  (End of clause)

TITLE:  Infospace Concept Exploration and Development 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-03- IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 31 Mar 05; FY 06 by 01 Nov 05; FY 07 by 01 Nov 06; and FY 08 by 01 Nov 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development and operation of information management technology in accordance with AFRL Information Management technology goals.

To date, discussions and research involving a Community of Interest (COI) Infospace, i.e., an infospace consisting of multiple information management systems, have been in the abstract, with only isolated system instantiations.  Multiple information management infrastructures have been developed conforming to the Infospherics Common API.  This BAA seeks to inject stability into the creation and management of these infospaces, and to provide a meaningful and substantive foundation from which to evolve practical, operations-ready COI infospaces.  Proposals should focus on the development of best practices, concepts for implementation, recommended architectures and common COI representations. Initial concept demonstrations are preferred with limited prototype software development.  This solicitation is divided into two technical areas with the following topics common across both areas:  information engineering, information management, policy management, operational performance, security, and Quality of Service (QoS) 

Area (1):  Composable Infospaces.  This topic area seeks the development of information management technology to support COI infosphere development, operation, and/or information migration.  Common tools and methodologies are sought for use by COI information managers in the creation of, or within, the enabled infosphere supporting their shared processes and missions.  COI infospheres may utilize multiple information management services over multiple overlapping COIs - sometimes referred to as Communities of Action (COAs).  Multiple, evolutionary stages of technology are anticipated:  initial creation and information engineering processes, deployment or operational transition, and lifecycle support as COI membership and needs evolve over time; as well as the management and exchange of information between dissimilar COIs.

The technical issues listed below identify specific concerns, but should not be used to limit or constrain innovative ideas:   
(a) Information engineering processes to establish a shared vocabulary, the common set of information objects necessary to achieve the mission objectives of the COI. 
(b) Identification of tools, techniques and methodologies to support use of a managed infospace for knowledge interchange within a COI. 
(c) Information migration between dissimilar COIs or legacy systems.  
(d) Information management technology supporting distributed and or integration of multiple information management services. 
(e) Discovery of Information Objects, and Information Object Repository management tools. 
(f) Compatibility with DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy COI concepts as outlined in http://www.dod.mil/nii/org/cio/doc/COI_FAQ.doc.

Area (2):  Dynamic Systems Interoperability.  This topic area seeks the development of information management technology to enable and support the instantiation, integration, operation, and disposition of functional and/or operational entities that are temporally dynamic within and across COIs.  Capabilities should include, but not be limited to, establishing functional entity producers and consumers, policies, context, roles and security from a reusable, flexible and extensible configuration baseline.  This research should also address the semantics of the configuration baseline within the context of a functional and/or operational deployment. 

The proposed information management technology must be capable of supporting multiple dynamic operational airborne scenarios.  The following scenarios illustrate some of the critical aspects that should be addressed by this research.  Scenario 1:  Entry of an airframe into an operational theater to perform some C2 mission.  This scenario highlights the need to identify specific requirements to support the dynamic entry and configuration of a new entity into an existing COI.  Scenario 2:  Tasking of a combat air patrol entity to transfer to a coalition command and provide close air support to units across a broad geographical area.  This scenario highlights the need for dynamic reconfiguration of an entity as an element of a different COI within a heterogeneous command.  Furthermore, this entity must function across an IP infrastructure that is dynamically reconfigured several times within the course of the mission, while preserving association with the original COI.

The offeror can assume that the necessary hardware and software technology to enable dynamic airborne IP-based networking is in place, i.e., no new development in this domain is sought under this BAA.  Such dynamic systems interoperability technology should be considered sufficiently robust that intermittent network connectivity will not require reinstitution of an entity’s configuration baseline.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $15M.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY 05.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $0.7M; FY 06 - $4M; FY 07 - $4.3M; FY 08 - $3.6M; and FY09 - $2.4M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 to $200,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.


III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All potential applicants are eligible.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 05-03-IFKA.

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  WE ARE SOLICITATING WHITE PAPERS ONLY.   DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. See Section VI of this announcement for further details.    

For additional information, a copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

    Mr. Dale W. Richards
    Telephone:  (315) 330-3014
    Email:  Dale.Richards@rl.af.mil

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued consulting services of Dr. Berta Geller, University of Vermont, One South Prospect, Burlington, VT 05401 for a base year with one six month option period.  The ARP administers The International Breast Cancer Screening Network (IBSN), a voluntary consortium of individuals charged with evaluating breast cancer screening within countries that have active population-based screening mammography programs.  The consortium was established in December 1988 with representatives from 11 countries. The consortium has since grown to encompass 25 countries.  The IBSN holds biennial meetings and in the interim, the specific activities of the IBSN are moved forward through working groups. Working groups have collected information to describe policy and guidelines used within programs, to summarize the extent of quality assurance activities related to technical quality, personnel performance, data collection and follow-up activities, and most recently to compare select measures of performance and outcomes such as late stage disease and mortality among participating countries.  At the 2002 meeting of the IBSN, participants discussed the need to evaluate women's communication and decision making needs related to mammography screening -- a convergence of need in nearly all countries driven in large part by the recent scientific and media debate on the benefit and risk of mammography screening.  Over the past two years the IBSN Decision Making and Risk Communications working group chaired by Dr. Berta Geller completed a study about communication tools and the group has produced two papers on the results of their work.  At the meeting in 2004 it was decided that it was important to develop a “how-to” manual based on the state of the art in the literature and in practice that would provide guidance for communication tool development to countries with cancer screening programs. The manual is intended to be developed in draft form for review by the group at the next biennial meeting of the group planned for May 2006.  In order to complete this work Dr. Geller will continue to serve as the chair of the IBSN Decision Making and Risk Communications working group, managing communication to the working group members and IBSN related to this project, and working with NCI staff in moving forward work related to the develop of the manual.  Dr. Geller has a doctoral degree in education and 20 years of experience in women’s health research.  She has long been an active member of the International Breast Screening Network (IBSN) and serves as the Chair of the IBSN Decision Making and Risk Communications Working Group.  In addition, Dr. Geller is currently Principal Investigator of the Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System, one of the NCI Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium sites, and has served as past chair of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, all of which make her uniquely qualified to provide expert consultation to this project.  These services are the continuation of an on going project and Dr. Geller has been Chairing the IBSN Decision Making Risk Communications working group and collaborating with NCI on evaluating breast cancer screening which is being continued and elaborated upon.  Dr. Geller is the only known source to the NCI researchers with this knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researchers to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 25, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

Period of Performance:  
Three months, beginning April 1, 2005 and ending June 30, 2005.

Description of Project:
A telephone survey examining the influence of personal and environmental factors on cancer screening will be conducted.  The list of survey questions will be provided.  A total of 500 low-income, African American individuals who are over 50 years old, and who use Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) clinics need to be interviewed.  The survey will be conducted by a firm specializing in conducting telephone surveys.  Telephone numbers will be randomly selected based on a purchased sample list.   
Upon answering the phone, interviewers will explain to a respondent that he/she was selected to participate in a survey about health care and will ask if the individual would like to participate.  If the respondent provides consent to participate, the interviewer will then establish eligibility by asking: 1) if respondent is 50 years or older, 2) if individual uses a BPHC clinic, and 3) and the race/ethnicity of the individual.  If the individual is not 50 years or older, the interviewer will ask to speak to someone else in the residence that meets the age eligibility.   If respondents meet the age eligibility, but does not use a BPHC clinic or does not self-identify as an African American the telephone survey will be terminated. If there is no answer, a number will be called a total of 6 times before it is discarded and replaced by a new number.   Interviews will take place between the hours of 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily.  Upon completion of data collection, the survey research firm will provide a data file that will not include any identifiers.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This notice W15P7T05RP419 augments/updates the exis ting BAA topic with the following information: The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is interested in receiving white papers covering the development and demonstration of MEMS-based phase shifters for the Armys phased array antenna applications, which may include satellite communi cations on-the-move (SATCOM OTM), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, seeker missiles, target identification (TID), active protection radars, etc.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to update the state-of-the-art (from 27 Jun 0 3 RFI) for MEMS phase shifter technology prior to authoring the 3QFY05 request for proposals (RFP) for the Armys Affordable Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays (APSPA) Manufacturing Technology Objective (a.k.a. ManTech or MTO) program.  The MEMS portion of t he APSPA MTO will be one (1) 3-yr, approx $5M contract focusing on manufacturing technology and process improvements, with goals of high yield and reliability and the lowest possible cost (target $5-$10) per phase shifter.  The ultimate goal of the APSPA M TO program is to provide the Army with low-cost, reliable phase shifters and thereby reduce the cost of the SATCOM and radar arrays driving the Armys Transformation. Currently, the MEMS community utilizes a variety of switch topologies as potential building blocks for integrated phase shifters, each with its own inherent advantages and disadvantages.  The primary goals of this RFI are: 1)	to solicit information regarding the current (FY05), near-term (FY06), and long-term (FY08) readiness of both discrete MEMS switches and integrated phase shifter designs 2)	to solicit discussions/recommendations regarding performance/manufacturability trade-offs Discussions/recommendations of interest include, but are not limited to: switch architecture, frequency dependencies (mil/com bands in 8-44GHz range), RF power handling (max vs typ), cold/hot switching, DC power consumption, RF loss, switching speed, relia bility, hold down time, phase shifter architecture (e.g. TTD, phase), packaging scheme, packaged geometry/size, hermeticity, failure mechanisms, accelerated life testing, vibration/shock resilience, thermal effects, substrate dependencies & manufacturing c oncerns, cost per bit (3 vs 4-bit), production costs (1,000-1,000,000 quantities), current programs/applications and commercialization potential.   The forthcoming RFP will outline the Armys requirements in detail and solicit a thorough technical and programmatic proposal.  For this RFI, white papers shall be limited to no more than 20 pages of technical discussion, with an additional 15 pages for im ages, graphs, measured/calculated data, etc. if necessary.  Samples are acceptable under this RFI, but are not required.  If delivered, the government is under no burden to test or evaluate the devices.  Respondents will have 30 calendar days from the date  of publication to submit white papers to the Contracting Officer, Julianne.Magee@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.  Phone 732-427-1499.  Please direct any technical questions to Mr. John Nilsen at 732-532-9210 X5624.

<SUBJECT>C--Architect Engineer Services for One Indefinite Delivery Type Contract in Support of the Kansas City District Corps of Engineers for Board of Consultants Services on the Tuttle Creek Ground Modification Project
<SOLNBR>W912DQ-04-R-0025
<RESPDATE>113004
<ARCHDATE>02202005
<CONTACT>Rosalind M. Whitfield, (816)983-3923
<DESC>Description This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act (PL 92-582) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps o ff Engineers, Kansas City District, is seeking one qualified firm to provide Architect-Engineer (A/E) Consultation Services in the form of a five to seven member Board of Consultants in support of the upcoming Tuttle Creek Ground Modification contract that  is being awarded as a Construction Manager-At-Risk contract.  The type of contract proposed for the Board of Consultants is Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery type contract.  Each firm shall submit a complete Board of Consultants.  Individual consultant s or firms without a complete Board will not be considered.  The contract will be for one 36-month period and will have options to extend the contract for two additional 12-month periods.  The contract for the base period will not exceed $3,000,000.  Each option period will not exceed $1,000,000.  The total amount of the contract will not exceed $5,000,000.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under the resulting contract must be at least equal to those determined by the D epartment of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).   The project web site is  http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/projects/tcdam/index.htm.  The Tuttle Creek Evaluation Report and Environmental Impact Statement are available for download from the web page and will be included in the solicitation for specific backg round on the project.  Report appendices not included in electronic format are available in hard copy from the Project Management point of contact listed below.  Historic contract drawings and historic subsurface information will also be provided with the solicitation.   Project Information Tuttle Creek Dam is located on the Big Blue River, in the Kansas River basin, approximately 6 miles north of the City of Manhattan in eastern Kansas. Tuttle Creek Lake covers approximately 12,500 surface acres at normal pool with over two million acre-feet  of storage below the flood control pool. The dam is a rolled earth fill and hydraulic fill embankment, 7,500 feet in length, standing 137 feet high with a crown width of 50 feet and a base width of 1,050 feet on an alluvial foundation. The dam is located in a zone of moderate seismicity dominated by the Nemaha Ridge and Humboldt fault zone.    Seismic and geotechnical investigations have established that an earthquake larger than a 5.7 magnitude could cause liquefaction of the foundation sands and potential failure of the embankment. The Maximum Credible Earthquake for consideration at the dam i s a 6.6 magnitude. Depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, significant deformation of the entire embankment, and release of the lake is possible.  In order to address the risk of embankment breach during an earthquake, the foundation under the embankment is to be stabilized using jet grouting to mix cement into the foundation sands under the upstream slope of the dam and deep soil mixing to accomplis h similar goals beneath the downstream slope of the dam. This ground modification project could potentially involve the treatment of over 400,000 cubic yards of soil.  A cement cutoff wall that extends to bedrock beneath the dam to depths of up to 180 feet  to stop normal seepage through the sand beneath the dam is also required.  Services Required Types of services required will include a board of five to seven individuals to perform:  Geotechnical review, studies, reports, meeting participation, and construction site visits on the Tuttle Creek Dam Ground Modification Project awarded separately as a  Construction Manager at Risk contract.   The Board of Consultants (BOC), as the consultant group will be known, w ill be responsible for input on, and review of, the full scale field demonstration ground modification test program proposal, development of the geotechnical baseline report, contract drawings, specifications, design analyses, FLAC deformation modeling, so il parameter modeling, modified ground parameter modeling, and quality control/quality assurance of ground modification.  Additional technical guidance will be required throughout the contract.  The Board will familiarize themselves with past evaluations b ut will not evaluate seismicity, or overall liquefaction potential.  The focus of the Board shall be on the construction of the foundation modification.  The following are estimated hours of consultation services per Board member that should be used to det ermine the scope of this solicitation: 		Year		Hours 		FY05		 100-400 		FY06		 100-400  		FY07		 100-400 		FY08 (option)    100-300 		FY09 (option)    50-200 Travel will include up to 20 site visits to Manhattan, Kansas or Board meetings at locations to be determined per individual throughout the life of the contract.  The Joint Travel Regulation will be used to determine costs associated with travel. Selection Criteria Selection criteria are listed in order of importance. Criteria a, b, and c are primary. Secondary criteria, d and e, will only be used as a tie breaker.  The contractor will be competitively chosen using Best Value Source Selection procedures.  For this co ntract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). a.

<DESC>Reference is made to the January 21, 2005, FedBizOpps posting, Reference Number 0210023B, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for conducting a Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Lower Airspace Feasibility Study and Implementation Plan for SADC.

This is to notify interested U.S. firms that the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the project sponsor or Grantee for the project, received a written request for clarification of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the SADC CNS/ATM Transition Plan project by a U.S. company.  We are herewith providing a public response to that request, providing the same information to all potential bidders on this project.

The questions posed by the U.S. company are written in bold letter type.  USTDA's and SADC's joint responses are written below each corresponding question.

Question 1:  The RFP Introduction (page 4—3rd paragraph—second sentence) states that "the project was to be performed by a U.S. company on a sole-sourced basis, as requested by SADC."  Please identify that company.  Will this company be competing for the Feasibility Study?

Answer:  The company is Innovative Solutions International, Inc.  The Grantee has indicated they would like this study to be competed.  We have no knowledge of whether Innovative Solutions International, Inc. will compete for this Study, however the competition is open to all bidders.

Question 2: There are four versions of the TOR in the RFP: 1) on page 5 of the Introduction; 2) one beginning on the first page of Annex 1; 3) in Annex 1 to Amendment 1 to the Grant Agreement; and 4) in Annex 5.  The TORs are similar—not identical; which one governs in the event of conflict?  I believe that the TOR in Annex 5 will govern as the last sentence of 1.2 Objective on page 5 of the RFP Introduction states, "The TOR for this Feasibility Study is attached as Annex 5."  Is this belief correct?

Answer: The Terms of Reference (TOR) that govern this project are included in Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement, included in Annex 4 of the RFP; and in Annex 5 of the RFP.  These TOR are identical.

Companies need to carefully study the Grant Agreement and the Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement in Annex 4 of the RFP.  The Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement amends the Grant Agreement in several important ways.  Some of the key changes the amendment makes include, among others: (a) replacing the TOR in the Grant Agreement entirely; (b) increasing the amount of grant funding from the original $600,000 to $808,359; (c) dividing the Study into two phases and providing for a U.S. company cost share as part of funding the overall cost of the Study; (d) changing the seat of the Grantee from SADC's Southern African Transportation and Communications Commission to SADC's Civil Aviation Committee; (e) making the grant competitive to all U.S. companies; (f) making USTDA funds for the grant pursuant to prohibitions of U.S. legislation from the fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2004; (g) adding a U.S. company cost share that will be used for those countries where USTDA grant funds are prohibited, as outlined in point (f); and changing the Study completion date.

Companies should carefully note which countries the U.S. company cost share (US$8,061) is required for as they prepare their proposals.  USTDA grant funds may not be used for countries included in the official SADC region where U.S. Government foreign assistance is prohibited, as outlined in section 512 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002; section 512 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004; section 620(q) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended; or Executive Order 13288.  

Please note that this clarification is intended only to give an overview of what Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement entails.  It is by no means a replacement of that document.  Companies should refer to the Grant Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement in Annex 4 of the RFP for the requirements of this grant.


Question 3: In the TOR provided as Annex 5, Task 2 is to "collect and evaluate existing studies, surveys and policies pertaining to CNS/ATM, lower and upper airspace systems."  In contrast, the first paragraph of the introduction defines the Feasibility Study as for "…Lower Airspace Feasibility Study and Implementation Plan."  Is the scope of the Feasibility Study to include upper airspace as well as lower airspace or is the requirement simply to be compatible and consistent with existing upper airspace plans?  And are the existing studies, etc. to be collected and evaluated available from SADC or will the project require obtaining such documents from their original sources such as Sofreavia, the French company that performed the previous study?

Answer: The Terms of Reference (TOR) govern this project, so companies must follow them carefully.  However, to answer the question, the second paragraph of the "Introduction" section in the TOR states: "The SADC Civil Aviation Committee and the Upper Airspace Control Center (UACC) Steering Committee seek the development of a Study to determine the viability of the lower airspace in terms of the Upper Air Space Control Center (UACC)." 

In answer to the second part of the question, SADC wishes to advise that it may make available copies of those studies that were executed at a regional level and commissioned by SADC on the clear understanding that the proposed Study will not replicate but build on the earlier work in accordance with the agreed TOR.  They would also like to make it clear that the other data collection activities required of the Contractor as outlined in Task 2 of the TOR remain relevant and critical to the successful execution of the Study.

<SOLNBR>000000
<RESPDATE>022305
<ARCHDATE>03102005
<CONTACT>Lisa Nelson, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 874-5029, Fax (202) 874-5625, Email lisa.nelson@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
OCC is in search of a web-based on-line booking system to schedule, reserve and confirm 29 
in-house conference rooms.  The system must be real time, offer response tracking with a conference room request, handle multiple dates, and have the capability to send emails from within the system.  It shall have the capability to request and confirm catering, and capture catering costs, capability to request audiovisual equipment, request accommodations for people with disabilities, capture multiple room sets.  Provide reporting capabilities not limited to the reporting requirements identified in the Reports section.   It must capture special written instructions to support any request made to the Conference Office. 

In addition to the above requirements, the system must have the capability to notify not only the individual requesting the room, but also the meeting sponsor and the expected attendees at the same time a room change is required or a cancellation occurs.   

Provide reporting capabilities not limited to the reporting requirements identified in the Reports section. 

An additional consideration is a system that can also include the necessary information to schedule off-site events, i.e. meeting requirements, number of guest rooms, audiovisual requirements, food and beverage, etc.

THE SYSTEM MUST BE 508 COMPLIANT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE.  

VENDORS WHO HAVE ON-LINE SYSTEMS THAT CAN PROVIDE WHAT IS SOUGHT  HEREIN, SHOULD PROVIDE 4 SETS OF DETAILS ON THE PRODUCT AND ITS CAPABILITIES AND THE EXTENT OF 508 COMPLIANCE TO LISA S. NELSON BY FEBRUARY 23, 2005.  INFORMATION MAY BE SENT BY MAIL OR COURIER TO COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, 250 E STREET, SW, MS 4-13, WASHINGTON, DC  20219.

BACKGROUND:
The Conference Office is currently using two different systems.  The first one is used to request the conference room, food and beverage, and audiovisual equipment.  This system is an in-house system developed by OCC’s IT staff.  The second system actually books, reserves, and confirms the room, food and beverage and all audiovisual equipment.  The OCC pays an annual fee to use this system.  

Some of the problems experienced by using two separate systems are:  ensuring the data is copied correctly from one system to another; limited reporting capabilities, which only the Conference Office can use; overloading the system with data causing the system to crash requiring the Conference Office to reenter the information; lack of email capabilities in one of the systems; and multiple entries for the same information is accepted by the system (i.e. a name enter with the first letter capitalized and the remaining letters not, will create a second record if the same name is enter with all capital letters, or a third record if its entered last name first, first name last).  One of the systems does not allow the customer to enter the system or generate any reports.  

CONFERENCE ROOM REQUESTS:
Conference room requests can be made for a meeting lasting from 1-hour up to 9-hours, from 1 day to 5 days.  Requests are received for weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly meetings for up to 1 year in advance.  The difficulty using two different systems has been ensuring the correct information is entered into the system i.e. start/end date or start/end time, catering and audiovisual equipment entries, etc.  The Conference Office employee booking the meeting needs an indicator that the meeting is planned for more than 1 day. 

All data entered into the system by the requestor needs to be automatically transferred from the request to the actual scheduling of the event to eliminate unnecessary keystrokes and errors.

<ARCHDATE>02112006
<CONTACT>Rebecca McFarland Contract Specialist 9169785540     rmcfarland@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is issuing this announcement to identify potential certified HUBZone and/or 8(a) Small Business concerns who would be interested in performing construction work at Stony Gorge Dam.  Stony Gorge Dam and Reservoir are part of the Orland Project in Northern California.  The dam is located on Stony Creek, about 21 miles northwest of Willows, California.  The dam was completed in 1928, with modifications performed in 1985-86.  Stony Gorge is an Ambursen-type dam comprised of 46 bays of slab and buttress construction, with buttresses spaced on 18 feet centers.  The dam has a structural height of 139 feet and a crest length of 868 feet at crest elevation 847.0.  Stony Gorge Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure. The proposed construction work on Stony Gorge consists of a structural modification to address known seismic and hydrologic deficiencies of the dam.  The work incorporates simply supported reinforced concrete diaphragm walls cast between the downstream buttress walls.  The work will require unwatering and excavation under of the downstream face of the dam, drilling, installation, and grouting of concrete anchors in the existing buttress walls, forming and placing reinforced concrete diaphragm walls between the existing buttress walls under the dam.  The work will require the contractor to job fabricate special forms and material handling systems to meet the restricted access under the downstream portion of the dam.  Some of the work will be performed under the existing spillway slab.  This work has limited access.  Other alternative means for material and equipment access include cutting holes in the reinforced spillway crest slab.  The dam and associated land has limited work, staging and stockpile areas.  The contractor will be required to meet various environmental restrictions during performance of the work.  The upstream reservoir water surface will not be lowered for construction purposes.  The dam crest right of the spillway control house is designed for overtopping.  The top of active conservation storage in the reservoir is elevation 841.0.  Release facilities at the dam include a spillway, outlet work and power plant.  The power plant will remain in service during the performance of the work.   All work required to be performed and completed within 540 calendar days from the date of issuance of the Notice to Proceed.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard in millions of dollars is $28.5.  However, the government reserves the right to change the classification if deemed necessary.  The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be more than $10,000,000.  All letters of interest and qualifications should be submitted within 10 days of posting this synopsis.    Should you have any technical questions or details of the site visit, contact Richard Welsh at (530)934-7066.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in September 2005.   The procurement method will be best value in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations PART 15.  Two of the technical factors that will be used to evaluate the offerors are:  1) Technical approach for the work including a detailed resource-loaded schedule and 2) Past experience and performance in constructing or rehabilitation of concrete dams within the past 5 years.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.   Interested parties should include the following information in their response:  (1) Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone), and a point of contact.  (b) A copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone small business concern.  (c) A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor and (d) Evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience regarding the construction or rehabilitation of concrete dams of similar type work described above within the past 5 years.  In addition, include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform required work.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, all interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  Therefore, replies are requested from all interested parties, regardless of business size or category.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice electronically via e-mail at rmcfarland@mp.usbr.gov or on company letter head not later than March 4, 2005 to Rebecca McFarland-MP-3836, U.S. Dept of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, Acquisition Services, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E-1815, Sacramento, California 95825-1898.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applied to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  The Government plans to offer any interested contractors an opportunity to visit the site and view two preliminary drawings prior to submitting their letter of interest and experience qualifications.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI)
 
The Air Armament Center, 46 Test Wing, Technical Directorate, Investment Programs Office,  is beginning the planning phase in preparation for development of a miniaturized instrumentation system for DOD test applications. This effort entails the integration of commercial off- the shelf (COTS) components into a wireless sensor network and bi-directional telemetry link.  Key features of the system concept are:

•Flexible non-intrusive external system (components can be mounted to and removed from test assets without permanent modification)
•Wireless components
•Utilizes existing range infrastructure for data telemetry downlinks
•Maximum use of COTS components and off-the-shelf generic personal computers (PCs) and data storage systems to reduce cost and ensure availability

System components would include:

•Miniaturized distributed wireless accelerometers capable of providing near real time acceleration data
•Strain gauges, pressure transducers and load cells capable of measuring and transmitting loads information at needed locations on aircraft, suspension equipment, and stores
•Inertial measurement units integrated with GPS receivers capable of providing accurate near real time store separation and/or trajectory data from weapon launch to impact.
•A miniaturized data acquisition system and telemetry transceiver that can be    non-intrusively mounted on an aircraft or store for communication with a ground station.
•A ground station consisting of a base station, data storage unit, control PC, an interface to existing test range high-gain tracking/receiving antennas, and a network connection to existing range infrastructure.  





The following is a depiction of the system concept:





















                               
                                                           

Fig. 1 – System Concept

In Fig. 1, the red symbols represent a wireless sensor network.  The blue symbols represent the telemetry data acquisition system and transceiver.  Note the bi-directional link to the ground tracker/receiver.

Flight test applications would include:

•Aircraft Flutter/Vibration Testing:  Distributed wireless accelerometers would provide near real time acceleration data.

•Aircraft and/or Store Loads Testing:  Strain gauges, pressure transducers and load cells would provide loads information at needed locations on aircraft, suspension equipment, and stores.

•Store Separation Testing:  Inertial measurement units integrated with GPS receivers would provide accurate near real time separation data.

•Weapons Testing: Inertial measurement units integrated with GPS receivers would provide near real time trajectory data from launch to impact.

In addition to flight testing, there are numerous other DOD applications for this system such as   developmental testing, operational testing, and training.  There are also numerous potential applications in the commercial sector.  

It is anticipated that the initial program would consist of the following phases:

Phase I:  Feasibility Studies/Concept Exploration

Phase II:  Prototype Hardware/Software Development/Functional Testing/Environmental Testing

Phase III:  System Demonstration

At this time the Government is merely exploring contractor interest and capabilities in meeting the described requirements.  In response to this RFI, please provide an indication of your interest and capabilities, along with a rough order of magnitude cost.  Responses will be considered competition sensitive if requested.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

This will be other than full and open competition using OEM RFD Beaufort, Inc. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to RFD Beaufort, Inc. parts are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEM.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition, as they are available from one source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  The submission of technical data packages for review shall not impede the award.  It is the Government’s belief that only RFD Beaufort, Inc., the manufacturer of the Mark VII life raft can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  The US Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the parts of an alternate product.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  ***This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP)***.  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Rachelle J. Stanley, Contract Specialist (CODE 044).    See number notes 22, and 26*****

<DESC>COMPLETE DOCUMENT CAN BE FOUND UPLOADED AS FULL ANNOUNCEMENT TOGETHER WITH ATTACHMENTS.

The Agency for International Development (USAID), USAID/Colombia, under its’ Agriculture and Alternative Development Office (AADO) intends to focus upon galvanizing strategic private sector 
response capacity to the economic growth opportunities and challenges associated with a healthier macroeconomic setting and an integrated trade/investment environment.  AADO’s “Additional Investment 
for Sustainable Alternative Development” Program (Más Inversión para el Desarrollo Alternativo Sostenible (MIDAS)) is the vehicle designed to address these issues.   The Colombian private sector reflects a broad continuum of entities which range from large, sophisticated corporations owned by Colombian or multinational investors, as well as, entrepreneurs engaged in micro enterprise business ventures.  Each class 
of business entity has the potential to expand its operations and to create new job opportunities that will encourage the unemployed to avoid the entrapment of illicit activities. USAID’s goal will be to provide 
small and medium sized enterprises (SME) with strategic institution-building support programs designed to sustainably address the primary informational and market development barriers which limit SME growth potential in Colombia.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent - Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) for 2010 Decennial Census
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau plans to acquire the services of a Prime Systems Integrator who can develop, implement, and manage the systems (applications, equipment, local area networks, telecommunications) and provide the supporting services (maintenance, training, logistic support, monitoring, etc.) required to conduct data collection operations for the 2010 Decennial Census.  This effort involves deployment of over 400 temporary decentralized offices established throughout the 50 states, District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to conduct these data collection operations.  The FDCA contract must provide an end-to-end system that works seamlessly in a real time environment.  The winning offeror will have responsibility for managing the system design, software development, integration testing, telecommunication, maintenance, deployment, monitoring, and disposal services in support of critical address updating, data collection, administrative, and management applications for regional and local offices.  At peak, the staff is in excess of 500,000 census workers.

The acquisition strategy will utilize the advisory multi-step process (hereafter called “voluntary down select”) as described in FAR 15.202.  “Step One” is the release of a Draft Request For Proposal/Pre-Solicitation Notice that will generally describe the scope and purpose of the FDCA acquisition.  The Draft Request For Proposal/Pre-Solicitation Notice is scheduled for release by mid April 2005 and will contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in this acquisition (i.e., they possess demonstrated past experience as a prime successfully managing programs of similar size, scope, and complexity). The notice will request information on past performance, experience, and a technical executive summary.  For evaluation purposes, past performance will describe “how well” contractors performed work, and experience will reflect “whether” contractors have performed work similar in scope and magnitude to the FDCA requirements.  In the “Step One” process, offerors will be evaluated on a “GO/NO GO” basis.  The Census Bureau will evaluate only the Prime System Integrator’s performance and experience (whether or not the prime has already formed subcontracting partnerships for this effort will not be considered or evaluated. However, the prime’s past ability to form and manage highly successful partnerships will be evaluated). Offerors that are evaluated as “NO GO” will receive in writing the general basis for the Census Bureau’s finding that it is unlikely the offeror is a viable competitor.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), the offeror will also be advised, “Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.”  After the voluntary down-select process, the Census Bureau will publish on their website the names of the Prime Systems Integrators invited to proceed to step two.  Small businesses are encouraged to contact these companies for subcontracting opportunities.

Step two of the evaluation process involves the release of the formal RFP by June 2005 to offerors invited to participate in the acquisition and all others who choose to submit a proposal in spite of the Government’s finding that it is unlikely that the offeror is a viable competitor.  Based upon the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the contracting officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of all the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306(c)(2).

All offerors that are within the competitive range will enter discussions/technical interchange with the government.  During the technical interchange, offerors will produce, at their own expense, a “near production ready” prototype for Census Bureau inspection and evaluation in a field test.  The design expectations of the prototype will be released in the draft and final Request For Proposal.  During the technical interchange period, the Census Bureau will also hold discussions with the offerors followed by the request for final proposal revisions for evaluation.  Contract award is scheduled for April 2006.

The FDCA Contract Management Office will conduct a symposium and exhibition in the Census Bureau Headquarters’ Conference Center on February 28, 2005 at 9:00 AM.   This symposium and exhibition will discuss the aforementioned contractual requirements in the context of the 2010 Decennial field worker operations, office operations, telecommunications, security, logistics, and support management requirements, as well as a complete discussion of the acquisition strategy. 

Space for this event is limited; therefore Prime Systems Integrators are invited to register on the Census Bureau Acquisition Division website, located at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/fdca, by February 23, 2005.  Each company is limited to not more than ten participants.

On April 1, 2005, the FDCA Contract Management Office will host a FDCA Small Business Conference in the Census Bureau Headquarters’ Conference Center.   This conference will cover similar topics to those presented in the February 28th Prime System Integrator’s Symposium and Exhibition as well as topics of interest to the small business community.  Prime Systems Integrators are invited to participate in this Small Business Conference for the purpose of meeting with the small businesses and assessing collaboration opportunities.  A registration site with instructions for small businesses and Prime Systems Integrators interested in this conference will be established in late February 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotes (RFQ).

A.  Requirements:    The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) requires contractor support to provide temporary non-personal services in areas including, but not limited to:  administrative, professional, clerical, technical, scientific, medical and laborer positions.  This requirement is SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY.  Applicable NAICS Code is 561110 with a small business size standard of $6,000,000.   Firms with GSA or other FSS contracts may consider this a request for reduced pricing under FSS requote procedures.  The resulting order will be a three year IDIQ and USUHS will issue a separate task order for each position.  All three years shall be evaluated together.  This procurement is being conducted as a Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.

Detailed statements of work or task statements will be included with each task order.  Usually, the USUHS will locate and recommend a potential individual for each position.  The contractor will then interview for the position, make a hiring decision, confirm the hourly price and make a formal employment offer.  Firms are instructed to propose a multiplier, which will be applied to the gross pay amount for each employee to calculate the hourly price.  Firms may propose a fixed dollar amount that may be charged to cover recruitment and interviewing costs when USUHS does not recommend the employee for a given position.  

Selected contractor shall be able to place an employee on site within 48 hours of receipt of a signed task order.  The contractor and their employee will be paid only for hours actually worked or otherwise authorized.  The USUHS may change the work schedule of any position with 24-hour notice to the contractor.  The Contractor is authorized to bill for designated employees who are to be paid for Federal holidays.

Time Cards – The contractor will develop a time card to document the name of the person, USUHS Department assigned, hourly rate, hours actually worked for the time period, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  This time card will be verified in writing by the employee and USUHS personnel and a signed copy provided to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor will not provide service for any task order in excess of the number of hours authorized.

Invoices – The contractor may bill on a bi-weekly basis and the invoice will contain line item detail for each person.  The line will contain the person’s name and USUHS department, hours actually worked for the time period, the hourly price, the amount being billed, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  Copies of time sheets will be attached to each pay period summary.  The invoice will be submitted to the COTR (in both hard copy and MSExcel electronic format) and payment will be made by VISA purchase card.  

The contractor will be responsible for compliance with all Federal, State and local employment laws and regulations including withholdings, reporting and visa restrictions.  USUHS will provide base access and any required security investigations. On an as needed basis, the contractor will conduct or arrange background investigations and provide for any required occupational health and safety requirements (USUHS will reimburse the contractor for the cost of these investigations, examinations, etc.).  

The USUHS currently secures these services from Jardon & Howard Technologies, Inc. under delivery order #HU0001-05-F-0154.  There are currently approximately 32 individuals working under this order and an offeror should expect to transition most, if not all, of these individuals.  USUHS may rely upon this contract to a significantly greater extent in the future particularly for instructors, who are paid as consultants.

B.  Line Item/Prices

The contractor will supply personnel under the following conditions at the following prices:  (For line items 1 through 4 the firm shall propose a percentage by which the hour price will be calculated for each position.

STATEMENT OF WORK DGPS RTCM REFERENCE STATION AND INTEGRITY MONITOR SOFTWARE DRIVER FOR SEPTENTRIO SATELLITE NAVIGATION POLARx2 GPS RECEIVER
1 GENERAL.
1.1 Background: The Coast Guard Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) broadcast network uses an Ashtech Z12R Marine Reference Station (RS) to detect Global Positioning System (GPS) signal errors and calculate corrections. And, a Trimble 4000IM MSK Integrity Monitor (IM) provides high-precision
positioning and integrity monitoring functions. The RS generates required Radio Technical Commission
for Maritime (RTCM) Special Committee (SC) 104 data message and modulates those messages into a
medium frequency (MF) signal that is fed to a radio frequency linear power amplifier (RFLPA). The IM
generates required integrity data messages for the RS. A problem exists because the Ashtech Z12R and the
Trimble 4000IM are no longer manufactured or available. The system functionality of both these
equipments is still required by the Coast Guard DGPS System. A replacement method of calculating GPS
errors, formulating the required RTCM SC-104 messages and generating a modulated signal to the RFLPA
has been developed that uses software previously delivered by The XYZ’s of GPS to Coast Guard
Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN). The software uses raw data observables from a high
quality GPS receiver to calculate DGPS correction and formulate the required RTCM SC-104 messages.
The present software only has drivers/interfaces for the Ashtech Z12R, Trimble 4000IM and Trimble
NetRS GPS receivers. Each manufacturer and sometimes-individual equipments have slightly to vastly
different interface requirements for communicating with the equipment. In order to ensure the new DGPS
broadcast network system remains an open architecture additional drivers/interfaces must be developed
prior to field prototyping of the new system.
1.2 Personnel.
1.2.1 Citizenship: All contractor employees used on this contract shall be citizens of the United States, or if aliens, shall be legal residents of the United States
1.2.2 Employee Identification: In the event a contractor employee is working on-site at C2CEN, appropriate identification shall be provided in accordance with C2CEN security procedures.
1.2.3 Employee Conduct: The contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all applicable local and higher regulations, policies and procedures, e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, security, wearing of parts of
military uniforms, and possession of firearms. The contractor shall ensure that all its employees present a
professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States,
the Department of Homeland Security or the Coast Guard.
1.2.3.1 Removing Employees from Installation for Misconduct or Security: In the event a contractor employee is working at a government site, the Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the contractor to remove any employee from the installation for misconduct or security reasons. Such removal does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide sufficient qualified personnel required for adequate and timely services.
1.2.4 Conflict of Interest: The contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to, cause a conflict of interest. The contractor shall not employ on a part or full time basis an employee of the Coast Guard, uniformed or civilian, unless the Coast Guard has officially approved that employment.
1.3 Quality Control Program: The contractor shall have a written Quality Control Program that is acceptable to the Government and that assures that all work will conform to contract requirements.
1.4 Government Quality Assurance: The Government will evaluate the contractor’s performance under this contract using the task requirements and quality standards in this performance work statement. When an observed defect is other than minor, or when on-the-spot corrective action as to the cause cannot be taken, the Government will use a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), shown on Exhibit 1, to advise the contractor of the problem and require contractor response or corrective action.

<DESC>This amendment A) extends the closing date for receipt of quotations from February 15, 2005 to February 18, 2005, B) answers vendor questions, and C) modifies the language of the solicitation.

A) TIME EXTENSION:  By this amendment, the time and date for receipt of quotations is extended to 3 PM local time, February 18, 2005.

B) RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS:

1.  It is extremely difficult to find acceptable hotel accommodations for April 19-20, 2005. Are there any other acceptable alternative dates for the conference?

RESPONSE: See revised specification language. SSA can accept any of the following dates: April 19-20, April 20-21, April 26-27, or April 27-28, 2005.  Dates outside these periods are unacceptable.

2.  Would SSA accept any conference location other than Baltimore’s Inner Harbor area, including locations over 5 miles from the Baltimore Inner Harbor, or in another city?

RESPONSE: No, SSA requires a conference location in the Baltimore Inner Harbor area.

3.  Does SSA have a conference planning firm in mind to do this conference in this very short timeframe?

RESPONSE:  No. SSA is competing this requirement and expects firms will be able to respond to this solicitation within the timeframe established.

4. Has SSA preselected or otherwise arranged already for the conference location/hotel?

RESPONSE:  No. SSA requires vendors responding to the RFQ to propose a location as part of their quotation.

5.  To quote on the RFQ, should we select a hotel that we feel would fit your group rather than going through a site search?

RESPONSE: It is up to the vendor to determine whether it will propose a hotel in its quotation based on its knowledge of the market (as well as availability of suitable facilities for the required days) or a site search.  If you mean by this question that you presume that you can quote on the requirement without proposing a specific hotel facility, with the understanding that you and SSA will settle on a site after a post-award site search, that is an incorrect assumption.  As stated in the solicitation (Instructions to Offerors, 2)B)), you must provide a proposed conference site, with sufficient detail about facilities proposed so that SSA can determine that they are in fact suitable for the event. SSA will not award the order to a firm without a specific, proposed conference site suitable for the conference requirements and available for the conference dates.  Note also that the specification requires a detailed report on the proposed conference facilities within 10 days of award (Pre-Conference Activities, Task 2).

6.  Has this meeting been held before?

RESPONSE: Yes, there was a HOPE conference on August 24-26, 2004. SSA competed and issued order SS00-04-30871 to A-S-K Associates, Inc., of Lawrence Kansas for planning and related services for $78,249.34, and order SS00-04-50266 to the Wyndham Baltimore Inner Harbor hotel for meeting space for $6,900. This year SSA will issue one order for both planning and related services, and meeting space.

7.   Is there an incumbent contractor?

RESPONSE: See question #6

8.  What is the incumbent contract number and value?

RESPONSE: See question #6

9.  Hotel accommodations in the Baltimore Inner Harbor are already heavily booked for the April 19-20 period because of other planned events. Can you modify the requirement for the contractor to offer the Government rate for sleeping rooms to conference participants?

RESPONSE: No, SSA requires (Pre-Conference Activities, Task 2) that the vendor provide accommodations at the Government rate. Note that SSA has added additional acceptable time periods for the conference.

10. Will conference participants call in their room reservations individually?

RESPONSE:  Yes, the conference participants will be responsible for making their own room reservations. 

11.  Will the contractor handle a VIP or speaker room block?

RESPONSE: No. This is not part of the requirement.

12.  What is the projected number of conference participants for each breakout room?

RESPONSE: 40 participants for each breakout room. 

13.  What is the estimated number of speakers/presenters for the conference?

RESPONSE: 5 speakers.

14.  How many of the speakers/presenters will attend the conference from
outside the Baltimore metropolitan area?

RESPONSE: 5 speakers.

15.  Will the contractor pay lodging and/or travel for speaker/presenters and other special guests?

RESPONSE: No.

16.  What is the projected number of conference participants needing reimbursable travel, lodging and per diem?

RESPONSE: 50 conference participants. 

17.  Will the contractor pay for any conference participant's travel, lodging and/or per diem?

RESPONSE: No. All conference participants will either pay their own way, or will be reimbursed by the Government directly. The contractor will have no involvement in this.

18.  Will conference participants pay a registration fee for the
conference?

RESPONSE: No.

19.  Is it correct to state that providing any breakfast (continental or other) is not part of this requirement?

RESPONSE:  That is correct. Conference participants will be responsible for providing their own breakfasts.

20.  Is the contractor responsible for providing notepads and pens, or should I simply assume the pads and pens typically provided by the hotel will be sufficient?

RESPONSE:  As stated in the specification (Pre-Conference Activities, Task 2), the vendor must provide notepads and pens, not the hotel.

21.  Do you have an invitation list--or will one have to be developed, and
what role do you expect the contractor to play in this?

RESPONSE: As stated in the specification (Pre-Conference Activities, Task 4), SSA will provide the list and invitation text, and the contractor will do the mailing (electronic and paper), and tracking of responses.

22.  How many persons are on the invitation list?

RESPONSE: 143 persons.

23.  How many persons do you anticipate sending paper invitations to and how many do you wish to invite by email?

RESPONSE: That will be at the contractor’s discretion, in consultation with SSA’s project officer, after award.

24.  Concerning evaluations forms, does SSA plan on having evaluations for each breakout session or just one per day?  If it's by session, can you tell me if the breakout sessions repeat or should I count on four unique breakout sessions per day?

RESPONSE: SSA requires evaluation forms for each breakout session.  As to whether all breakout sessions will be unique, SSA has not determined that at this time.  The vendor should assume, for quotation and pricing purposes, that each session will be unique and will require a separate evaluation form.

25.  In order to price printing costs, I need to understand better what SSA wants the contractor to hand out to conference participants at registration.  Will folders with photocopied handouts suffice, or do you require binders of printed material?  

RESPONSE: Providing folders with photocopied handouts meets the specification (Pre-Conference Activities Task 6, Conference Packages).

26. Is there an established procedure for completing, and format for, the final
report?

RESPONSE: No, that will be up to the contractor, in consultation with SSA’s project officer. The deadlines for the draft and final version are in the specification.

27.  Will the final report include conference proceedings (minutes of the sessions)?

RESPONSE: No.
