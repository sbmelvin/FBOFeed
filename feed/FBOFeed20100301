<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the Navy Production Capacity Improvement Project. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals. The work will involve an initiative to upgrade and refurbish the existing domestic heavy forging capacity to support the Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. The awardee is expected to comply with government performance specifications and quality levels, and to fully qualify the upgraded and refurbished production capabilities. The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or a Technology Investment Agreement, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Lehigh Heavy Forge Corporation, 275 Emery Street, Bethlehem, PA 18015. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to support the heavy forging requirements of the DoD by addressing items that impact cost, quality, yields, and delivery. This initiative will focus on upgrading and refurbishing, as necessary, the production equipment and supporting infrastructure for heavy forged parts of interest to the DoD. Heavy forging production includes the forging of ingots of up to 300 tons and 130 inches in diameter. The primary military applications for heavy forgings include propulsion shafts, pressure vessels, and bull-gear ring forgings to support the US Navy for both their surface and subsurface vessels. Heavy forging production to support the DoD requires a 10,000 ton open die press, the supporting internal infrastructure, an established supply chain for vacuum stream degassed ingots, and specialized transportation. Additionally, qualification work with Government agencies will be required to ensure government product requirements are met. Note: For this program, the offeror must be a domestic, high volume producer of heavy forgings, and must be able to demonstrate significant marketing/customer sales experience in the production and sales of heavy forgings to the DoD. The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 27 months. Key tasks will include: Development and implementation of production improvement plans addressing cost, quality, yields, and delivery; Continued support to the DoD customer product specifications and qualifications; Analysis of the US military heavy forging marketplace; and Development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic business plan and a marketing plan that addresses both Government and commercial applications. The Government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b)," based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government. Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing (either electronically or mail), to the POC(s) listed above, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall identify the offeror's current production capabilities and capacities for production of heavy forgings, including the required infrastructure to support the production of heavy forgings for the DoD. Documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered along with market share. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both DoD and other customers that currently utilize the offeror's heavy forged products. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22.*****<br />

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for all necessary labor and management to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on Government owned and operated marine vessels. The contractor will provide marine mechanics in support of Customs and Border Protection marine repair facilities throughout the nation.  This service is necessary to maintain the assigned vessels in an operationally ready condition to meet the mission requirements.  CBP has utilized the services of Global Maritek Systems, Inc. (GMSI) as the primary contractor for vessel maintenance since 2004.  Given the current support activities performed by GMSI and in order to ensure continuity of services, CBP intends to award a sole source bridge contract to continue these vital services.

This bridge contract will allow CBP the additional time needed in order to complete the source selection process for the follow-on National Marine Maintenance Contract.

The period of performance of this effort will be April 1, 2010 - September 30, 2010.

Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, at which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.

If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated.

14.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended. 

15) Units are bordering or are near Developed Recreational Areas. Contractor should be aware of need to work with Forest Service Recreation Workers and the Concessionaires to the extent that greater volumes of recreational users are expected on weekends, Holidays, and during the project work period. Traffic control will be needed in and outside of these Developed Recreational Areas and Safety is the responsibility of the Contractor.

The project area is located on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest; Clark County, Nevada.  The Project is approximately 21 Air Miles Northeast from Las Vegas on Highway 156. The Project starts at approximately the intersection of Highways 156 and 158 then Southwest for approximately 3.5 miles on Highway 156. The project can be reached by motor vehicle by leaving Las Vegas on Highway 95 North to the intersection with Highway 156 East. Highway 156 leads to Highway 158. The work requires the pruning to specification of trees, the cutting of trees not scheduled for pruning, and the cutting to specification of shrubs scheduled for removal. Trees, limbs and shrubs will be chipped-on-site or removed to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Chipped materials, wood cut to firewood lengths and trees cut to 25-foot or less lengths remain the property of the contractor until Final Acceptance of Unit or Project. At Final Acceptance of Unit or Project, ownership of cut materials is transferred to the Forest Service which may issue permits to the public for removal.  Approximately 100.0 acres are scheduled to be Chipped-in-Place. In addition, under a separate Pay Item, approximately 8 trees near structures are scheduled for removal by Directionally Felled Techniques, and removal to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Ownership of these trees is retained by the Forest Service and will be disposed of by the Forest Service. The material to be pruned, cut and piled or chipped-in-place is shrubs and small trees.  Most trees are less than 14 diameter measured at 4.5 feet above the ground (DBH). The contract period will be contiguous, and will occur between May 15 and June 1.  This pre-solicitation notice is for a unit-based performance service contract on approximately 100.0 acres, approximately 8 Directionally Felled Trees, plus mobilization. In Units designated as Hand Treatment Methods, the Forest Service has determined that cut materials are able to be transported to a chipper by hand methods. In Units designated as Hand Treatment Methods or Yarding Methods, the Forest Service has determined that some materials may require a yarder to transport to a chipper. In these acres additional labor will eliminate the need for a yarder. Contractor may allow the Public to remove cut materials or chips from the units or from the Process and Storage Areas until Final Acceptance of the Unit or Project. At final acceptance of unit or project all cut and chipped materials becomes the property of the Forest Service. The contract requires the Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supplies, supervision, and incidentals necessary to achieve the objectives.  All work shall be performed during daylight hours, and shall not exceed 10 hours in one day.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Precision X-Ray, Inc., of North Branford, Connecticut, for the acquisition of a 320 kV High Stability X-ray Generator to replace the instrument currently being used as part of an x-ray system currently being used by NISTs Physics Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

The Ionizing Radiation Divison of NISTs  Physics Laboratory currently utilizes three Pantak X-ray systems in its laboratories.  One of these systems has failed and must be replaced with an identical system.  Replacing the failed system with an identical model will allow interchangability of parts with the other two remaining Pantak systems in use at NIST, compatibility with the existing custom-designed tube stand, heat exchanger, and shielding design in the laboratory, and direct comparability of the new systems beam qualities with the existing reference beam qualities. 

Pantak, Inc. has been succeeded by Precision X-Ray, Inc., who continues to sell and service Pantak equipment and components.  Precision X-ray, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the Pantak 320 kV X-ray unit that meets NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Precision X-ray, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Pantak 320 kV X-ray Instrument.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 16, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 524126   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is soliciting Requests For Quotes (RFQs) for insurance coverage of EPA vehicles that cross the border for responses and exercises in Canada.  This requirement will be procurred in theform of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  The U.S. EPA is responsible for responding to environmental emergencies, including releases of oil and hazardous substances due to accidents, natural disasters, acts of terroism, and other causes.  EPA has agreements with Federal agencies in Canada to support each other during incidents that may occur along shared international borders.
When entering Canada, EPA personnel are required to provide proof of insurance that covers government vehicles and any potential liabilities that may emerge from the operation of U.S. Government vehicles while on Canadian soil.  U.S. Government vehicles are driven into Canada to attend planning meetings, participate in exercises, and respond to actual releases on the borders.  Before allowing U.S. Government personnel and equipment to enter Canada requires that EPA personnel provide proof of primary coverage from a third-party insurance company or broker.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is:524126
A RFQ is requested based on the Task Descriptions located in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW describes the EPA's need for vehicle insurance coverage for Canada.   Your quote should consist of dailiy, weekly, monthly and yearly costs for vehicle insurance.  The quote should be broken out over a span of five (5) years.  All interested vendors must be registered under the Central Contractor Registry (CCR):  (www.ccr.gov) in order to do business with the Federal Government.

________________________________________________________________________________
                               STATEMENT OF WORK:Insurance Coverage for EPA Emergency Response and Exercises in Canada
PURPOSE     a. When entering Canada EPA personnel are             required to provide proof of insurance that covers                     vehicles and any potential liabilities that may emerge              from the operation of U.S. government vehicles while                on Mexican or Canadian soil.  For example, the           Government of Canada requires proof of insurance                   when U.S. government  vehicles are driven into           Canada to attend planning meetings, participate in                    exercises, or  respond to actual releases on the border           (usually in a waterway/river).  Before allowing  U.S. government personnel and equipment to enter the           country, Canada requires that EPA personnel provide           proof of primary coverage from a third-party insurance             company or broker.
       b.EPA anticipates purchasing coverage on a government fiscal year basis (October through September 30) through a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  The initial coverage will be for the period of (to be determined at time of award), 2010 through September 30,  2010.  However, the total period of performance shall cover a total of five (5)    years from the date of signature on the BPA.
       c. The average value of the EPA response vehicles          vary from $25,000 up to $400,000 as some contain                      specialized response equipment. Depending on the             nature of the border crossing (exercises or response                 to incidents), different employees may drive these                     vehicles.

BACKGROUND
          The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for responding to environmental emergencies, including releases of oil and hazardous substances due to  accidents, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other causes. EPA has agreements with agencies in Canada to support each other during incidents that may occur along shared international borders. These agreements call for EPA personnel and equipment to enter into Canada to respond to environmental emergencies.  EPA also works with Canadian counterparts to perform joint exercises of contingency plans and to discuss preparedness and response issues. These planning and preparedness activities also necessitate cross-border travel of EPA personnel and equipment.  
TASK DESCRIPTION FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE IN CANADA     1.  The policy shall provide third party automobile liability insurance coverage for the US border with Canada.  EPA anticipates the need for up to 18 vehicles from our border regional officer to cross the border into Canada (25 kilmeters inland) on an annal basis, with five or fewer vehicles in Canada at any one time.  Some of these vehicles, which may include SUVs, 4-door sedans, pick-up trucks and recreational vehicles serving as mobile command posts and laboratory units and could, include specialized equipment on these vehicles.                  a)	 The maximum duration of each trip would                depend on the circumstances, ranging from a  few days for planning meetings to weeks or months for responses to environmental  emergencies;                  b)	 Up to 100 personnel could be involved over a       year's period;                  c)	The limit of liability per occurrence should be          $1,000,000.00, with accident benefits per statutory                       requirements;                  d)	The policy should include the a "Permission to      Rent or Lease Endorsement" and a "Blanket  Basis Fleet Endorsement";

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Describe current and past Minuteman III Re-entry program experience and relevance to the services described herein. Describe knowledge of and experience with handling of Nuclear Weapons Related Material; 2) Management System. Describe the management approach to be employed on the program; 3) Personnel Experience.

Demonstrate that the facilities to be used in this effort meet the hardware storage requirements in terms of environment and security safeguards; 5) Demonstration of Capability. Describe the plan (and schedule), prior to contract award, that demonstrates the potential offeror's capability to perform all tasks required.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by 23 March 2010 to 526 ICBMSG/PKA, ATTN: Dee Rose, 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258 Room 25, Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, or dee.rose@hill.af.mil. No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide ongoing technical support for a federal grant program.  The work will include the provision of technical support needed to assist with implementation of program regulations.  It will include the provision of support for the corresponding data collection, reporting, and performance measurement requirements in a Web-based system used by program grantees and sub-grantees.  Finally, it will include technical support for the programs data validation functionality incorporated in the data collection system. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541611.

The small business size is $7 million.  SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Include whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. 

Background
The programs grantees are required to submit participant data electronically in order to reduce costs and improve quality.  To accommodate the collection of information needed to measure the programs performance results, the government has provided grantees with a Web-based data collection system, in use since 2004, which allows grantees to directly enter participant data into the program database.  The data collection system is an extremely complex performance reporting and case management system with over 310 data elements displayed on 65 separate screens.  It currently serves over 1,400 distinct users from 74 grantees in all states and U.S. territories, over 800 sub-grantees and local projects, and 80 government users and contractors.  The system automatically generates all reports used to evaluate grantee performance.  It is designed to meet all current federal information privacy and security requirements.  The database currently has over 300,000 individual records.

 

Instructions and Response Guidelines

All contractors responding to this announcement must demonstrate six core competencies.  Please indicate in your narrative whether or not your existing capabilities meet the requirements listed below:

1. Specification writing.  Writing technical specifications for the software contractor and testing software modifications.  Enhancements, repairs, and modifications to the system are required continually in response to changing legislative and other requirements.

2. Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance to be provided in a timely manner to program end-users, as well as to government employees and contractors associated with the program.  End-user technical assistance falls into five categories:
a. Software Technical Assistance  supporting grantees and sub-grantees in their use of the data collection and reporting system.  (This requires collaboration with a third-party software development contractor.)
b. Program Technical Assistance  distribution of data definitions, policy interpretations, best practices, and other program information.  (This requires collaboration with a third-party contractor responsible for recommendations regarding policy interpretation and implementation.)
c. Reporting and Performance Measurement Technical Assistance  helping grantees and sub-grantees interpret and use the data quality reports and performance reports produced by the data collection system.
d. Data Validation Technical Assistance  helping grantees and sub-grantees use the data validation module in the data collection system.
e. Documentation and Training  developing user guides and other explanatory documentation for grantees and sub-grantees, and maintaining the data collection system help module.

3. Support for federal office program staff and for other program contractors.  In this capacity the contractor must be capable of reviewing and providing input on policy documentation, assisting with data analysis, and supporting the customer satisfaction survey process.

4. Independent Software Verification and Validation.  Validating and approving all software developed by the programs software contractor, and constructing test strategies, detailed test plans, and the test data used for those purposes.

5. Web Site Support.  Maintaining and updating the programs Web site, a central repository of reference materials.  Web site support will cover data quality reports and performance reports, as well as the data submission process for some grantees that have chosen not to enter data directly into programs data collection system.

6. Data Validation.  Maintaining and modifying the systems data validation module as needed, including resolving any issues that may arise with the data validation samples.

This Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government to issue a Request for Proposals or award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, for the vendor-sponsored demonstration or the Government's use of such information.

<SUBJECT>Field Evaluation of Double Crossover Diamond Interchanges
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-10-R-00018
<RESPDATE>031710

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought. This is not an RFP. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting as market survey to identify potential sources that can provide the technical expertise for field evaluation of double crossover diamond interchanges (DCD) in accordance with the Scope of Work herein.
<p>Background</p>
<p>Many in-service diamond interchanges are approaching or have exceeded their design traffic capacity. Some sit at strategic locations on the local freeway and major arterial network. Congestion at these locations can create bottle necks that deteriorate the level of service for a large portion of the area transportation network. There is an urgent need to upgrade the traffic carrying capacity of these interchanges to alleviate congestion and improve air quality, not only locally but also system wide.</p>
<p>Increasing interchange throughput can be accomplished by adding lanes or replacing interchanges. These are major construction projects that are typically high cost. Throughput can also be achieved through the combination of innovative channelization, signing, and signal timing, which requires intimate knowledge of the traffic pattern at the site of interest, but can be done at much lower cost. We define the latter as non-conventional approaches. Non-conventional approaches capable of delivering the same level of capacity increase, but at significantly lower costs, are expected to gain more and more attention as DOTs seek to provide the best level of service at the lowest cost to the public.</p>
<p>One such non-conventional approach is the double crossover diamond interchange (DCD) also known as diverging diamond interchange (DDI). It was originated and first implemented in France. The idea is to combine the left turn and through traffic, thereby eliminating the need for a left turn lane and protected left turn phase. A DCD channelizes vehicular traffic on a grade separated crossroad from the right side of the road to the left side at the first ramp terminal, and channelizes the traffic back to the right side at the second ramp terminal. Within the two ramp terminals, the left turning traffic moves with the through traffic, and can enter the freeway without restriction. A DCD utilizes the entire length of the freeway overpass or underpass as storage space for left turning traffic entering the freeway. It is estimated that reducing the number of signal phases and allowing left turn and through traffic to move simultaneously during the green phase will increase the interchange throughput, and reduce crashes by reducing the number of conflict points. According to FHWA research, the DCD design increases capacity up to 30%. A DCD is especially suitable when left-turn volumes are high and opposing traffic on the crossroad is unbalanced.</p>
<p>In the United States, the first diamond interchange converted to DCD is located at I-44 &amp; US13 in Springfield, MO. It was opened to traffic in June, 2009. Two DCDs - Route 60 &amp; National Ave. in Springfield, MO, and I-15 &amp; Main St in American Fork, UT, are currently under construction and planned to open to traffic in late summer or fall of 2010. Three additional DCDs, I-270 &amp; Dorsett Rd in St. Louis, Mo, I-435 &amp; Front Street in Kansas City, MO, and I-590 &amp; Winton Rd in Rochester, NY, are planned for construction in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>In this statement of work, before period is the time frame of at least one month prior to the start of construction or major preparation work at a DCD site that results in changes to the traffic pattern; transition period is the time frame between 0 to 3 months after a DCD has been fully open to traffic; and after period is the time frame after a DCD has been fully open to traffic for 3 months.</p>
<p>Note: Fully open to traffic means all types of construction equipment are removed, all traffic signs and pavement markings are in place, and there are no signs of work zone.</p>
<p>Special Notes to Offerors</p>
<p>In this statement of work, various types of data collection needs are described. These data elements are to be used in conducting practical and objective field evaluation of the operational and safety impacts of DCD. The offerors are encouraged to propose more or less, or alternative types of data collection needs, and explain the reason(s) in support of the proposed evaluation methodology.</p>
<p>When proposing specific types of data collection technologies to meet the evaluation needs, the offerors are advised to think carefully about how each type of data will be collected and used, team members' experience with the proposed equipment, the level of R&amp;D work needed to ready the data collection system, and especially the level of labor effort required to reduce and archive each type of data. The general direction is to collect the right amount of data at the right locations during the right periods of time.</p>
<p>For crash data collection, reference sites are required to provide a baseline of the local crash trends. The number of reference sites proposed may impact the proposed budget. The offerors should balance the needs of accuracy and cost when proposing the required number of reference sites for each DCD.<br />Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of this contract are to evaluate the operational and safety impacts of converting an existing diamond interchange into a DCD through before and after study, and investigate how accurately the field observed traffic conditions at the DCD sites can be replicated in microscopic simulation in VISSIM.</p>
<p>Scope</p>

<DESC>This is a <strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong>. This is not a Request for Proposals. The NRC is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors and their capabilities to assist the NRC with the work areas described below. All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone businesses) are invited to submit a response.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements for Risk Assessment Training</span>:<br />As part of its effort to train NRC personnel in risk assessment techniques, the NRC provides a curriculum of 15 courses covering a wide rang of risk assessment topics. This is an established curriculum with course presentation materials available in Microsoft PowerPoint format. The NRC's Office of Human Resources Technical Training Center is seeking sources capable of maintaining and conducting the curriculum of courses described below:</p>
<p>&bull; P-102 Bayesian Inference in Risk Assessment - (5 days) This course covers basic applications of Bayesian statistical inference in risk assessment. Through lectures, workshop problems, and case studies participants are presented with mathematical techniques from probability and Bayesian inference that are currently being applied in risk assessments. The topics covered include a review of probability, selected probability models important to risk assessment, elementary Bayesian parameter estimation, introduction to Bayesian model validation, and uncertainty propagation through risk assessment models. The course is computer-based and utilizes Excel, RADS, and SAPHIRE, with an introduction to WinBUGS, which is useful for more advanced problems. Students should be familiar with the basic operations of Excel, but do not need to be familiar with RADS, SAPHIRE, or WinBUGS.</p>
<p>&bull; P-502 Bayesian Inference in Risk Assessment - Advanced Topics - (4 days) This course explores advanced applications of Bayesian statistical inference in risk assessment through lectures and hands-on case studies using WinBUGS and SAPHIRE. Students should have completed Bayesian Inference in Risk assessment (P 102) course. Students are expected to be familiar with WinBugs at the level as presented in P-102.</p>
<p>&bull; P-105 PRA Basics for Regulatory Applications - (3 days) This course addresses the special needs of the regulator who requires knowledge of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) issues and insights to better evaluate the effects of design, testing, maintenance, and operating strategies on system reliability. The full range of PRA topics is presented in abbreviated form with the goal of introducing the regulatory staffs to the basic concepts and terminology of PRA as applied to the inspection process. The course uses actual plant PRAs and IPEs and stresses the uses and applications of these publications in planning audits and inspections and evaluating plant safety issues.</p>
<p>&bull; P-108 NRC MC 0609 Appendix F Fire Protection SDP Training - (3 days) This course introduces the methodology described in Appendix F to the NRC Manual Chapter 0609, Fire Protection Significance Determination Process (SDP). Students will be introduced to the underlying theory of this SDP and will be taught to use PC-based tool for aiding in the execution of the SDP.</p>
<p>&bull; P-109 Assessing the Adequacy of Models for Risk-Informed Decisions - (1 day) This course is aimed at improving awareness of the factors that contribute to uncertainty in predictive models (both probabilistic and deterministic), and the need to identify, characterize and communicate the uncertainties to risk-informed decision makers. This course discusses the fact that all models are just estimates of reality and subject to many implicit assumptions and biases. It is the responsibility of the analyst to explicitly understand and communicate those assumptions, the limits of model applicability, and the uncertainty on the output. Much time is spent in the class on developing an appreciation for the value of a questioning attitude toward model use and reliance.</p>
<p>&bull; P-111 PRA Technology and Regulatory Perspectives - (9 days) This course addresses the special needs of Regional Inspectors, Resident Inspectors, and other technical personnel who require knowledge of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) issues and insights to better evaluate the effects of design, testing, maintenance, and operating strategies on system reliability. The course will concentrate on the use of PRA results in inspection planning, monitoring licensee performance, and reviewing licensee risk-informed submittals.</p>
<p>&bull; P-200 System Modeling Techniques for PRA - (4 days) This course will help develop advanced user level skills in performing event tree and fault tree analysis, with numerous practice workshops. The course covers the calculation of initiating event frequencies, component failure rate, and the use of "super components" to create fault trees. A second focus of the course is dependent failure analysis, including multiple Greek letter, binomial failure rate, basic parameter methods, and alpha factor methods for estimating common cause/common mode failure probabilities.</p>
<p>&bull; P-201 SAPHIRE Basics - (4 days) This course provides hands-on training in the use of Systems Analysis Programs for Hands-on Integrated Reliability Evaluation (SAPHIRE) for Windows to perform PRA on a PC. When the course is completed, the participants are able to: build fault tree models on the PC, assign reliability data, analyze the fault trees and develop minimal cut sets, calculate various importance measures, perform uncertainty analysis, analyze accident sequences, create and quantify accident sequences, and generate reports.</p>
<p>&bull; P-202 Advanced SAPHIRE - (4 days) This course provides hands-on training in the advanced features of Systems Analysis Programs for Hands-on Integrated Reliability Evaluation (SAPHIRE) for Windows to perform PRA on a PC. SAPHIRE allows the user to build and evaluate the models used in PRA. Participants will learn advanced features such as Flag Sets, advanced basic events (i.e., template, compound, common-cause, and human error events), and various rule editors (i.e., event tree linking, recovery, and partition rules).</p>
<p>&bull; P-203 Human Reliability Assessment - (4 days) This course serves as an introduction to Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) including the methods used in modeling of human errors and various methods of estimating their probabilities. This course is designed to teach introductory level skills in HRA and includes a broad introduction to HRA and its applications. A discussion of HRA strengths, limitations, and results is also included.</p>
<p>&bull; P-204 External Events - (4 days) This course deals with the analysis of external events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, high winds, and transportation accidents. The course has been developed to provide the student with information that can be used in the review of IPEEE results.</p>
<p>&bull; P-300 Accident Progression Analysis - (3 days) This course deals with the portion of probabilistic risk assessment typically referred to as Level 2 analysis. The course will address accident phenomenology under post-core damage conditions and will discuss development of PRA models for this severe accident regime. The emphasis of the course is on the important modeling issues and how they are dealt with, rather than how to use specific modeling software.</p>
<p>&bull; P-301 Accident Consequence Analysis - (5 days) This course deals with the portion of PRA typically referred to as Level 3 analysis. The course addresses environmental transport of radionuclides and the estimation of offsite consequences from core damage accidents. The major emphasis of the course is on important modeling issues and how they are dealt with, with a secondary emphasis on how to use specific modeling software. Hands-on modeling examples using the MACCS2 (MELCOR Accident Consequence Code System) software code are covered in the course.</p>
<p>&bull; P-302 Risk Assessment in Event Evaluation - (4 days) This course covers the use of PRA techniques to assess the risk significance of initiating events and condition assessments that occur at operating reactors. The course addresses the use of simplified PRA models to estimate conditional damage probability using the Graphical Evaluation Module (GEM) of the SAPHIRE suite of programs. In addition, common cause and non-recovery probabilities will be addressed. The course includes conventional workshops and GEM program workshops.</p>
<p>&bull; P-501 Advanced Risk Assessment Topics (4 days) The primary objective of this course is to provide a hands-on approach to the investigation and application of a variety of advanced risk assessment methods, tools, and techniques. This objective will be accomplished by discussing select topics followed by hands-on application for example exercises. As a result of these hands-on exercises, the student will become more proficient with Bayesian methods and the use of tools such as SAPHIRE, Excel, and WinBUGS for numerical analysis.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to locate business concerns interested in providing continuing support to further reduce incidents of driving while intoxicated (DWI) through the development and evaluation of measurement techniques for alcohol on the breath, development of performance guidelines for breath measurement devices, testing of instruments intended for police use, and technical support of demonstration and research programs.
<p><br />The Volpe Center is supporting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Alcohol Countermeasures Program. NHTSA's automobile ignition Interlock Device Testing Program because of its potential impact on alcohol countermeasures. The Volpe Center is testing interlock devices sent to the Volpe Center by the device manufacturers and preparing reports on all performed alcohol interlock device testing for NHTSA review.<br />The contractor will support this interlock device testing task by performing the following sub-tasks:<br />Assist with the laboratory testing of interlock devices; prepare reports on the interlock device testing; and attend interlock meetings, conferences, workshops, and events.<br />The contractor will help evaluate the international standards for breath alcohol analyzers developed by the Organization International de Metrologie Legale (OIML). The contractor will then help design and implement new Model Specifications for testing alcohol test devices. A new Model Specification will need to be written for Evidential Breath Testers to incorporate those OIML changes that NHTSA deems appropriate. The contractor will also help draft the NHTSA response to international standards for breath alcohol analyzers developed by the OIML.<br />The contractor will help the Alcohol Countermeasures Program provide new upgrades to the hardware and software for the Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS). The BASS is used to deliver various flow rates of saturated water/ ethanol vapor at 34&#61616;C to an evidential breath tester. The BASS is currently an electronically controlled, solenoid valve device. These solenoid valves open and close very rapidly, and this rapid movement can cause pressure variations. Since many modern breath test devices use sophisticated flow/pressure sensors, they may be confused by these pressure variations. The new BASS will be fully computerized and will use motion controllers to carefully open and close new valves.<br />The contractor will assist in the update of a tutorial paper discussing the Police Breath Alcohol test for lawyers and police officers.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center is seeking capability information. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS or QUALIFICATIONS. Do not include any pricing information. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only, and is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and possible issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any non-profit organization or small business programs.<br />Each response must reference the sources sought title.

<DESC><p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ISSUED ONLY TO CONDUCT A MARKET RESEARCH STUDY FOR AN ANTICIPATED PROCUREMENT.
<p>PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to assess the interest and qualifications of large AND small business firms, including Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns, Certified 8(a) Small Business Concerns and Certified HUBZone Small Business Concerns, in competing for a contract for an anticipated procurement entitled "INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL INTRUSTION DETECTION SYSTEM (ICIDS) Monitoring, Maintenance, Repair, Administration, Survey and Installation at Fort Lewis, Yakima Training Center and McChord Air Force Base, Washington." The information attained from this sources sought will be reviewed by the Government and used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15. The estimated performance period of the contract will include a one-year base period with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods. The maximum value of all work will be limited to $10M over the life of the contract. Tasks under the contract are estimated to vary in size from $2,000.00 to $200,000.00 and would include all necessary manpower and material required to perform replacement of ICIDS system components, scheduled adjustments, conducting tests, or other scheduled or non-scheduled work and all necessary services required for administering the system. In addition, some work may involve the installation of ICIDS systems and/or components. Service personnel working on this anticipated project must be trained on the OS2/SAFENET equipment and testing and administrative procedures. Additionally, all contractor personnel who serve under the contract shall be trained for ICIDS II monitoring services. The services required by the contract will include coverage for three (3) shifts, 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week, 365 days per year. The contractor must be MDI trained and certified for SAFENET systems (OS2 and Microsoft Office 2000) and must be able to demonstrate a minimum of three (3) years experience on systems of equal size, type, and complexity to the systems c in the proposed acquisition. In addition, contractor personnel must possess or have the ability to obtain a Top Secret-SCI clearance in order to perform work on the proposed project.<br />The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this anticipated procurement is 561621 with a small business size standard of $11.5M. <br />WHO MAY RESPOND: Interest in this Sources Sought announcement is open to both large and small business prime contractors, relative to the primary NAICS code 561621, that are located in Small Business Administration Region 10 (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska). Following review of the responses to this notice, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, the Government will develop an acquisition strategy to determine whether the solicitation for this project will be issued as a set aside for 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB or Small Business Concerns OR if the solicitation will be issued as Unrestricted to both large and small business concerns. <br />Note to Small Businesses: Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, provided that each team member meets the small business size standard for the acquisition and are deemed capable. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is a reasonable expectation of at least two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a "significant amount" of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract. Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA. A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business (SDVOSB) prime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVOSB contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other SDVOSBs. A joint venture of at least one SDVOSB and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVOSB procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. A qualified Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone) prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone small business concerns. A joint venture of two or more qualified HUBZone small business concerns may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone. Further information regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125). <br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT: If you are a Prime Contractor and your firm can meet all of the requirements identified under PROJECT INFORMATION for this anticipated procurement, please respond to this sources sought notice by providing ALL of the following information: (1) Name of your firm, to include address, phone, fax, e-mail address, and point of contact information. (2) Information indicating whether your firm is a Certified 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Small Business OR Large Business relative to the NAICS code of 561621.

(3) Information to describe your firm's ability to meet ALL of the requirements of this anticipated procurement as described under PROJECT INFORMATION.

<DESC>Task Order No. R09E480R03 Contract No. R09PC80029Project Title:  Construction Inspection Weber SiphonsTAS::14 0681::TASBOR Project No. 7.000Award Amount:  $223,446.73Award Date: 2/25/2010Vendor - Colorado Network Staffing DUNS 111480497. 8787 Turnpike Dr Ste 210. Westminster, CO 80031-7028.  Task Order Description:  Construction inspection services for the Weber Branch Siphon and Weber Coulee Siphon construction projects located in central Washington near Ephrata.
The above task order was issued as a non competitive, labor hour task order. In accordance with Department of the Interior Guidance Release ARRA-2010-01 contracting officers should consider placement of a task or delivery order against a bureau's or a DOl-wide Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This task order is against the Bureau of Reclamation Denver Acquisition Operations Group single award ID/IQ for technical support services R09PC80029 with Colorado Network Staffing an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. The base ID/IQ was issued as a direct award under the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) contracting program. Pursuant to FAR 19.805-1(a)(2) the anticipated dollar value of the base IDIQ contract did not exceed the competitive threshold to warrant a competitive 8(a) acquisition therefore a sole source 8(a) award was made.
A labor hour task order was determined to be appropriate for this requirement and no other contract type is suitable. The elements of consideration, prescribed by FAR 12.207 to be used as guidelines to assess whether or not a labor hour contract is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable, and the facts related to this acquisition are presented below.
a. Market research had revealed the required services are a commercial service, available under the Technical/Temporary Support Services ID/IQ contract with Colorado Network Services (CNS) an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. "CNS" has shown satisfactory past performance in providing similar services in the past.    b. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because the inspection services are required as long as construction is underway. The exact completion date of construction is unknown due to the high possibility of delays inherent in construction projects of this nature (i.e. weather, unforeseen site conditions, etc.). The anticipated construction completion date is May 15, 2011
c. In order to maximize the use of firm fixed prices this task order utilizes pre-priced firm fixed price hourly labor rates and includes a ceiling price based on the best estimate of the number of hours that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. The contractor is required to notify the government immediately when the total amount invoiced is expected to exceed 75% of the total amount of the order. Estimated travel-related costs and any other direct costs not covered in the labor hour rates will be reimbursed based on allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation.
d. There will be adequate Government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by Reclamation's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).   The COR will communicate daily with the construction inspector via e-mail and cell phone.  Each day the construction inspector will transmit a daily inspector report which will describe the work performed by the contractor, and identify any observed problems, etc.  The daily report will document the inspector's arrival and departure from the work site.

<DESC>In today's military, handheld systems are characterized by a tight integration of specialized hardware with a narrowly focused software suite. Most of the handheld devices are heavily optimized for a particular task and are ill-suited for general-purpose use. A soldier's radio, for example, has very limited data capability and essentially no multimedia capability. Current language translation devices support neither messaging nor collaboration of any form. This inflexibility in function is further exacerbated by the military's own acquisition process, a process that can take years to complete and involves an unwieldy linear process of formal requirements definition, technology development, and system certification. The current process adds considerable costs and introduces schedule delays to the deployment of new, cutting-edge technologies. Furthermore, there is a real risk that these very technologies will be obsolete by the time they are in the warfighter's hands.
<p>A transformation in technical approaches and business processes is called for. DARPA seeks to overcome current limitations and give our military ready access to the leading edge capabilities.<br /><br />As envisioned by DARPA, this transformation will:<br />&bull; Result in the rapid development of applications and system enhancements that keep up with the fluid demands of warfighter on the ever-changing battlefield; <br />&bull; Demonstrate both affordability and scalability that enable pervasive use, targeted especially among the end-users at lower levels in the military echelon;<br />&bull; Encourage and support open competition among a broad set of suppliers in the military applications development process; and<br />&bull; Support new business models and streamlined processes to incentivize a broad community of suppliers.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this RFI is to discover sources of commercial and non-commercial apps with potential relevance to the military specifically the national security community more generally. These apps may be used in situations such as the tactical battlefield, for humanitarian assistance, and in disaster recovery efforts. DARPA's initial interest will focus on apps developed on the iPhone or Android platforms that can be used today with little or no additional research and development expenses. Application providers may already have offerings in the commercial marketplace that could be adapted to meet these needs.</p>
<p>In order to meet this objective, DARPA extends an invitation to the developers of currently existing apps encouraging them to submit a whitepaper about their product offerings.</p>
<p>Attached is the full RFI with instructions on submitting whitepapers.</p>

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service in Louisiana is posting this Notice for a Request for Information (RFI) - Non-Rock Alternatives for shoreline protection projects along coastal Louisiana. Pursuant to FAR 15.201, this notice is being issued as a Market Research Request for Information (RFI).  This is Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990, Heavy Construction for non-rock alternatives in the construction of shoreline protection-type structures in the coastal areas of Louisiana.   Responses to this announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition planning decisions.  Depending on the responses, a future solicitation will either be set aside for small business concerns and/or be issued on an unrestricted basis.  For purposes of this announcement, a concern is considered to be a small business concern if its average annual receipts for the past three years, do not exceed $33.5 million.   

The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on capability, technology maturity and risk, price, innovative methodologies and other information to be used in non-rock alternatives for shoreline protection construction contracting. NO AWARD will be made from this Request for Information. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation. Potential offerors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback to Ms. Vicki Supler, Contract Specialist, 3737 Government Street, Alexandria, LA 71302. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of the potential projects is to install and monitor various shoreline protection alternatives in an area of the state where physical, logistical and environmental limitations preclude the use of current adopted methods.  Factors which will play a huge role in these endeavors are unstable soil conditions, subsurface obstructions, accessibility problems, etc. which severely limits the alternatives of shoreline protection.  Proposed shoreline protection features/alternatives shall have the capability to significantly reduce shoreline erosion rates and/or promote sediment accretion with the above factors being considered.

Capability statements are to be provided for projects which are limited to non-rock alternative methods of shoreline/bankline protection along the coastal areas of Louisiana.  Projects may include but are not limited to ideas, concepts, techniques which preclude the use of currently adopted standards.  Capability statement information shall contain new technology that has not been fully developed for routine application in coastal Louisiana or in certain regions of the coastal zone.  The contract type is yet to be determined.

As a follow-up to this RFI, the Government intends on using a contract or contract(s) to establish demonstration sites to test non-rock alternatives for shoreline protection projects.  Some locations may be remote and/or high wave energy environments.  Each Contractor will be asked to design, build and demonstrate their respective non-rock alternative in locations to be determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District has a requirement to renew the GE Global software assurance subscription for the software upgrades that was previously procured for the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Advantage Industrial Automation, Inc, 4775 River Green Parkway, Duluth, GA 30096-8567, under authority of FAR 6.302.  The contract for the subscription renewal and the purchase for the iFix software for the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems at the hydropower plants was originally competed and awarded to Advantage Industrial Automation, Inc.  The software assurance subscription provides necessary security patches, software updates, and technical support. The subscription renewal is required to maintain and operate the hydropower facility SCADA systems as well as meet NERC requirements. The subscription was originally purchased through Advantage Industrial Automation, who provided the software licenses for which the subscription covers.  This requirement is a renewal software maintenance agreement and must be renewed through the vendor from whom the software was originally purchased. The software toolkits are add-on components to the GE iFix software that was originally purchased. The toolkits are required to maintain and operate the SCADA systems.   Acquiring the toolkits through the same vendor would ensure the correct options are selected and correctly tied to original software license.  It is anticipated that a fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The (NAICS) code is 423430 and size standard is 100 employees.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has taken the lead in deploying both active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology throughout the Marine Corps. Previous efforts have installed RFID infrastructure at many CONUS and OCONUS USMC installations. The current infrastructure is built upon a proprietary Savi American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard. The DoD has mandated that the services transition their infrastructure to an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. In order to meet this mandate USMC restructuring to support a hybrid capability until all ANSI tags are moved from the inventory. This task order will serve to provide continued maintenance support and sustainment for the active RFID infrastructure while allowing USMC to pursue a multi year contract for system redesign and follow-on support and sustainment.  
The contractor shall meet this MARCORSYSCOM requirement by supporting and sustaining active RFID equipment at the USMC installations identified in the Statement of Work (SOW).  In fulfillment of this tasking, MARCORSYSCOM expects the contractor to provide technical expertise and guidance to local USMC personnel responsible for operating and maintaining active RFID components, and to travel to each installation to install, configure, test, and maintain specified active RFID hardware and software components.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for dermatopathology consultative services.	It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.   Inquires/information received after established deadline of March 8, 2010 12noon EST shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.VA BOSTON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Procurement for: Dermatopathology Consultation	2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR:	 Caris/Cohen DX3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the      agency's needs (including the estimated value).	Please include the IFCAP transaction number, dollar value and a description of the item being sought.     IFCAP Transaction # 523-10-2-2765-0046     Dollar value: $110,000 per year     Reagent cost: non applicable     Item Description: Dermatopathology consultative services.4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited. Currently, there has been no dermatopathologist in VA Boston and VISN 1 since Jan 2008. Attempts to recruit a dermatopathologist were unsuccessful; therefore we sought consultative services.  Consultative services include consultation of selected cases as well as dermatolpatholgy conferences at VA West Roxbury.  In consultation with the Chief of Dermatology, Caris/Cohen DX and Boston University Dermatopathology Department(BU) were considered.  Caris/Cohen was selected for the following reasons:1.	 BU could not meet turn around time (TAT) requirements.   Caris/Cohen could meet TAT requirements of 48 hours from receipt of cases.2.	BU required all blocks and slides and could not guarantee return of blocks.   This is against VHA handbook 1106.1.  Blocks must be kept on-site at VA.    Caris-Cohen does not require blocks to be sent.3.	BU staffing changes frequently whereas Caris-Cohen does not.4.	BU planned to assign a fellow rather than a senior staff member to review and lead conferences.   Caris-Cohen senior staff review VA cases as well as provide conferences.  Expertise of a senior level staff member is required for VA cases per Dr. Konnikov, Chief of Dermatology Service, VA Boston. Dr. Haynes, long time VA dermatologist and senior dermatologist at Brigham & Womens Hospital was satisfied with our previous Consultant in Dermatopathology, before he left.  Dr. Haynes said that he was satisfied with an experienced senior dermatopathologist to sign out VA cases.5.	VA Dermatology Staff and VA Pathology Staff are very satisfied with service provided by Caris-Cohen.6.	Caris/Cohen provides courier service free of charge. The courier picks up new cases and returns reviewed cases 2 times per week. All slides and blocks are returned in a timely manner.  BU and BWH do not provide courier service.  This would be an added expense to the VA to transport specimens.7.	Caris/Cohen has senior and experienced staff, only. Residents and fellows do not perform services.8.	Caris/Cohen provides adjunct services such as special tests when required.9.	Caris/Cohen provides faxed reports to decrease turn around times. 6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be published.Boston Medical Center- see #5, unable to provide services that would meet accreditation needs and was not willing to assign senior staff to VA cases.Brigham and Womens Hospital- In Jan 2008, BACL Lab Chief contacted the Vice-Chair of Dept of Pathology, no response received as to whether they were interested in providing services.  VA has experienced difficulty in receiving surgical consults reports for nerve, muscle and kidney biopsies.  Dermpath volume is much higher and it would not be practical for VA to follow up on getting reports.  Caris Cohen phases reports to decrease turnaround time. 	7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.A price analysis will be made prior to award to determine if the price is fair and reasonable.  Additionally, price negotiations may be conducted if the CO determines this is necessary.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of, firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.See #5 and #69.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not 	available.See #5 and #6     10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.Two dermatopathologists inquired about a part time position as Consultant in Dermatopathology to VA Boston Healthcare System.  The potential candidates were, affiliated with Brigham and Womens Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.  Both candidates were offered the position, but both candidates declined the offer.  One declined because of a commitment to devoting more time to his newly awarded research grant and the other declined because the offered compensation was inadequate to replace lost income from private practice.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

The responsible offerors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) database (available at: http://orca.bpn.gov/) system per FAR 52.212-3, and submit a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quote. Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1. Lack of registration in CCR will qualify contractor as ineligible for award. All responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to this solicitation, which shall be considered.

The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (best value).</p>
<p>Number of Contracts to be Awarded <br />The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals/quotes and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.<br /><br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: <br /><br />FBO NOTE 22 APPLIES:<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC> The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to the BAA.
<p>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program seeks to develop and demonstrate an independently deploying unmanned surface vessel optimized to provide continuous overt trail of threat submarines.  The program is architected to achieve three primary objectives.  The first program objective is to design, build, and demonstrate an X-ship based on clean sheet design approaches founded on the assumption that no person steps aboard at any point in its operating cycle, enabling beyond state-of-the-art platform performance characteristics.  The second program objective is to demonstrate the technical viability of an independently deploying unmanned naval vessel under sparse remote supervisory control to enable a new class of maritime system.  The third program objective is to leverage the unique platform performance and unmanned system characteristics of ACTUV, combined with a novel suite of sensors capable of robustly tracking quiet modern diesel electric submarines, to demonstrate a game changing ASW operational capability and to facilitate rapid transition of that capability to the Navy in response to critical operational demands.</p>

In addition to the scrutiny of civil environmental regluatory and enforcement agencies, environmental compliance incidental to Air Force activities or on Air Force property is subject to Air Force scrutiny. The Air Force routinely investigates environmental violations and cooperates fully with civil authorities to secure remedies and discourage future violations. Failure to comply with environmental statutes and regulations can subject the contractor to criminal and civil penalties and/or contractual sanctions including, but not limited to, termination, suspension, and debarment, and adverse past performance assessment. Contractors can obtain specific information regarding environmental compliance mandates in 316 WG/CC Memo "Andrews AFB Environmental Standards" dated 19 Oct 2006.

Persons later found to be undocumented or illegal aliens will be remanded to the proper authorities.<br />The contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation for delays or expenses associated with complying with the provisions of this clause.

East Aurora, NY 14052-1234 using authority FAR Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the procurement of F/A-18 A-D Leading Edge Flap Mechanical Drive Group System.  NAVAIR intends to procure approximately 700 Torque Tube Outline Flap System (part number 2022616-11-1).  This part is a shaft assembly outboard of the transmission assembly which will change in length to accommodate the longer transmission assembly.  NAVAIR will also procure approximately 700 Over Travel Stop/Torque Limiter Assembly (part number CA60722-001). The improved over travel stop module will be of a more robust design, capable of stopping a runaway inboard leading edge flap (LEF). The improved Torque Limiter will also be of a more robust design and will include features to indicate brake wear and tripping.  These parts address a critical F/A-18 A-D safety issues as up to date unconstrained inboard Leading Edge Flap runaways have lead directly to several Class A flight mishaps.  These parts are available only from the Original Equipment Manufacturer who has been previously selected as sole source vendor to redesign required components; award to any other source would pose enormous delays to incorporating this safety of flight change resulting in significant risk to aircraft and/or pilot.  For small business or subcontracting opportunities, contact MOOG directly at 801-974-7269.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to samantha.diedrich@navy.mil.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work.

(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:

These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.



(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

Past Performance weighting will be 30%, Past Experience weighting will also be 30%, Technical & Management Approach will be 20% and Price will be 20%.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to OfferorsCommercial Items.  Proposals will be evaluated and a contract will be awarded to the offeror who offers the best value in accordance with the following evaluation factors for this requirement. Clause 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items shall be used to evaluate offers:  <BR>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<BR>The Offerors proposal must be submitted in three parts: <BR>1. Technical & Management proposal <BR>2. Past Performance & Past Experience<BR>3. Price proposal<BR><BR>Each of the parts shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of each may be accomplished independently.  In an effort to support and ensure unbiased source selection, please do not make reference or indicate company identification in the Technical and Past Performance /Past Experience submission. Company information may be submitted as an additional part, if desired.<BR><BR>1. Technical & Management Proposal. Offerors are required to submit a comprehensive and complete technical & management proposal that demonstrates their ability to perform the work described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Offerors are cautioned to be responsive to all of the requirements of the PWS and provide sufficient information to allow evaluation of the proposal as listed in the Solicitation and this Synopsis. The technical proposal must be succinct, well written and presented in a clear straightforward manner in an 8.5 x 11 format. No pricing information shall be included in the Technical proposal.  For ease of evaluation, offerors are to submit the technical proposal organized into the following three parts:<BR>A. Plan of Action and Statement of Understanding. The offeror must submit a plan of action and statement of understanding in two (2) parts:<BR>a) Plan of Action-The offeror shall present a plan of action that describes the performance of the project. To include details of how, the contractor intends to fill required positions with personnel that are technically proficient with Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention processes, policies, guidance, and initiatives, as well as all other position requirements outlined in attached PWS.   Additionally, contractor must outline his action plan for adding remaining positions beyond the initial 11 position s filled at the beginning contract performance, upon request by the government. <BR>b) Statement of Understanding-The offeror shall submit a brief statement that demonstrates that he understands the mission statement and objectives the Government has established for each Position indentified in the attached PWS. This cannot be a repeat or mere summary of the materials provided in the RFP, but rather the offerors statement of his understanding of the detailed work.

All Offerors shall submit in their Proposals, profiles for only the initial eleven (11) positions identified as immediate.  However, if Offeror intends to retain all incumbent contract employees there will be no requirement for profiles at all in his initial proposal. But, please note the successful Offeror must still be prepared to provide profiles of the additional projected seventeen (17) positions immediately upon notification that funding has become available and the Government needs positions filled. In closing, please be mindful that the Government greatly desires that incumbent contract employees be retained and remain in place as there is no flexibility for a training phase and employees must begin Mission Ready immediately upon contract award.<BR><BR><BR>C. Management Plan / Quality Control. Submit a management plan that briefly explains how the team is organized to respond to the needs described for the services. The offeror should identify the overall effort proposed by the company as it relates to other work in which the company may be engaged.

Offeror lacking direct relevant past performance and/or experience shall provide citations and discuss projects that nearest approximate the type of work, complexity, size or work that otherwise demonstrates the quality of the work they can provide. Past performance citations shall be for contracts or tasks within the past three years and be of at least six months duration; may include work performed for federal, state, and local government and commercial firms; and may include work performed as a prime contractor, team member, or subcontractor.

Price Proposal.<BR>Proposals shall contain all cost information and will be used to evaluate the completeness, realism, and reasonableness of the cost numbers. The cost proposal must include all costs required to manage and perform all outlined tasks indentified the attached Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR><BR>The following adjectival ratings will be used for Technical & Management ratings:<BR>Adjectival rating	Description of adjectival rating<BR>Very Good	Proposal meets solicitation requirements, demonstrates a very good understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantage to the Government.  Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good	Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating:<BR>Risk rating	Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk	Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk	Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk	Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk	Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk	Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Experience Rating:<BR>Risk rating	Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk	Extensive amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Detailed experience was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk	Good amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement. Detailed experience was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk	Adequate amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Above Average Risk	Very little of past experience. Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk	Unacceptable amount of past experience. Experience was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral	No current and/or relevant experience record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Experience information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR>The government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposals should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your offer.

<DESC><strong>Additional Inquiries</strong> <br /><br />Security Language and BPA Language Conflicts.<br /><br />It has been brought to my attention that the Blanket Purchase Agreement(BPA) language indicates that the VHR should be prepared to work 5 days after the BPA is awarded.&nbsp; This is in conflict with the Security Requirements. <strong>No contractor awarded a BPA shall be permitted to work until they have received Preliminary Clearance.</strong>&nbsp; A premlinary background check is completed upon the receipt of the 3 forms and fingerprint charts.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;Preliminary determination shall be&nbsp;made, ifit is favorable, then the VHR will be contacted and sent to&nbsp;one of their hearing sites for training.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If it is unfavorable, the BPA&nbsp;shall be cancelled.&nbsp; It takes approximately 1&nbsp;year to complete the final&nbsp;determination because it is forwarded through the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI).&nbsp; &nbsp;Once this is completed, the VHR will be issued a favorable or unfavorable final&nbsp;determination letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is favorable, then clearance is good at any&nbsp;Federal Agency for a period of 5 years.&nbsp;<br /><br />If it is unfavorable, the BPA is cancelled and the VHR is removed from the Rosters.&nbsp; He/she will be paid for all work completed up to that point.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

ANSWER 1.This is not applicable to USTDA. The RFQ form SF1449 is a standardized U.S. government form that most if not all government agencies use.  USTDA does not give any sort of discount.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) requests sources sought information with regard to an Upper-Air Observation Capability (U-AOC). AFWA is interested in determining if an off-the-shelf system or technology exists capable of creating an atmospheric sounding profile remotely.</p>
<p>The U-AOC should be a scalable solution that can quickly be configured and deployed as part of an integrated theater sensing strategy to support service-specific missions and joint operations. The configuration should be as small as possible, allowing it to be human-portable.</p>
<p><br />The U-AOC should be able to remotely sense/derive and record the following parameters as an observation from the surface to an objective height of 50,000 feet or a height programmable by the operator to meet specific mission needs:</p>
<p>o Location and Geopotential Height <br />o Temperature<br />o Dewpoint Depression<br />o Wind Direction and Speed<br />o Pressure</p>
<p>The solution must be capable of automated operations without human intervention.</p>
<p>The U-AOC must generate observations continuously, on a pre-determined schedule, or on-demand as needed.</p>
<p>The U-AOC must measure parameters, process, store, and disseminate all required information in standard formats for local use and sharing with other users for operational situational awareness and weather analysis/forecasting applications.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors should submit descriptive literature and other information, such as price, availability, and contract number to the contracting officer at the e-mail address shown. Questions should also be addressed to the contracting officer.</p>

Section 3. Capabilities - Is the weight of the protective transport container or bag also included in the 5.5 lbs?<BR><BR>A:  If a protective transport container or bag separate from the launch tube is required, then it should be included in the 5.5 lbs.  The intent is that the maximum load added to the soldier due to carrying the munition is 5.5 lbs.  The only components accounted for separately are the Ground control station components.<BR><BR>2.  PARA 1, Subject, The LMAMS is designed to provide a soldier carried, soldier ground launched NLOS...  Obvious that LMAMS has to be portable, but are we looking for it to be launched from a man, shoulder, or can it sit on the ground?<BR><BR>A: The intent is for a single dismounted soldier to be capable of launching and controlling the munition.  As long as this is provided for, it is up to the offeror as to whether it is launched from a man, his shoulder, or with it sitting on the ground.<BR><BR>3.  Is the LMAMS launcher desired to be shoulder mounted during<BR>launch? <BR><BR>A:  The intent is for a single dismounted soldier to be capable of launching and controlling the munition.

Is the LMAMS launcher desired to support 360 deg. Azimuth directional (non-vertical) over some small Quadrant Elevation?<BR><BR>A:  Quadrant elevation, vertical or non-vertical, is left to the discretion of the developer.  The LMAMS munition shall provide 360 degree coverage capability.<BR><BR>5.  Is the LMAMS airframe desired to return to launch location when<BR>loss of control data link?<BR><BR>A:  No. A safe loss of link procedure for destroying the munition must be established.<BR><BR>6.

The Draft PWS (para 1.4) identifies Work Location:  Work shall be performed at the Government Site. and Part 4 of the Draft PWS suggests the Place of Performance will be determined upon award of the contract.

Will the RFP identify the expected level of effort associated with this seemingly unbounded marketing initiative?<BR><BR>Government Response #2:<BR><BR>Yes, we can specify the production of the tri-fold brochure and its forwarding to the Defense Activity for non-Traditional Educational Support (DANTES) for distribution to the field. <BR><BR>Contractor Question #3:<BR><BR>Will the RFP identify any/all automated tool(s) currently being used to assist the soldier and counselors in conducting their assessments?<BR><BR>Government Answer #3:<BR><BR>This is more a function of the AARTS Operations Center and its website.<BR><BR>Contractor Question #4:<BR><BR>Para 1.3 (Scope and Objectives)Are advisory services the same as counseling services?<BR><BR>Government Response #4:<BR><BR>That may be a matter of interpretation; however, the contractor would not normally do educational counseling for soldiers.  They only advise Soldiers concerning the status of pending course evaluations.  That is the duty of the Army Education Centers (AECs).<BR><BR>Contractor Question #5: <BR><BR>Question (b) reads& How can your company guarantee that the labor categories will be in place upon contract award?

<CONTACT>BAA-10-20 Administrator, Email BAA10-20@darpa.mil
<DESC>Amendment 2 to DARPA-BAA-10-20 Deep Sea Operations (DSOP)
<p>The purpose of Amendment 2 to DARPA-BAA-10-20 Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) is to provide answers to the questions received to date.</p>
<p>The following solicitation questions and answers are provided and continued from amendment 1, question 6:</p>
<p>Q7.    Where is the link to request the classified information?  Nothing requesting CAC card or SIPRNET access. <br />A7. Section 4.1, and Attachment A of the BAA provides the instructions to request the material. "This solicitation (DARPA-BAA-10-20), the DARPA-BAA-10-20 Addendum (FOUO), and the Security Classification Guide (DARPA-SCG-654) constitute the total BAA.  These three documents contain all information required to submit a proposal. A copy of the Security Classification Guide and Addendum can be requested via email: BAA10-20@darpa.mil."  The form (Attachment A) requires your cage code so that we may verify your ability to receive the classified information. If we determine from the form that your company is a DoD contractor, but that it does not have the ability to receive classified information, we will only forward the FOUO data.</p>
<p>Q8.  We cannot find reference to "Security Classification Guide (DARPA-SCG-654)" anywhere on the public NET.  This is also not available as a link from Fed Biz OPPS.  <br />A8. The Security Classification Guide is provided with the BAA Addendum to qualified offerors upon request using the form provided as Attachment A of the BAA.</p>
<p>Q9.  Please clarify how the word "Proposers" is meant in the following: Page 11 of the BAA states: "Proposers must have existing and in-place prior to execution of an award, approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose but at least Secret." Is this Proposes as in the group applying to the BAA (submitters) or Proposes as within the submitters groups? (Company, company, government teams)</p>
<p>A9b.   Proposes should read as "Proposers". The proposer is the contractor submitting the proposal. The proposer needs to minimally have a facility clearance and personnel to support Secret level work for the proposal to be considered.  This is further clarified in BAA Section 1.1, where the third paragraph states: "For proposal to be considered, proposers must have at least a secret facility clearance and evidence of the capability to conduct secret level research. Offerors are strongly encouraged to review the addendum to this BAA before considering a proposal submission. Section 4.1, and Enclosure A, provide the instructions to request the material."</p>
<p>Q10.  I am curious about the number of copies required. It states that 1 original and 9 copies are required. Do you require this for each volume, meaning 1 original and 9 copies of each volume totaling 20 binders or 1 original and 9 copies of the entire proposal?<br />A10. Section 4.3.1 Proposal Information in the BAA states:  Proposers must submit an original and nine (9) copies of the proposal and two (2) electronic copies of the proposal [in PDF (preferred)] on a CD-ROM. Specifically, for the paper submission this means one original of both the cost and tech and 9 copies of the cost and tech for a total of 20 volumes.</p>

<DESC> The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around MARCH 10, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.

1.)  The cutting to specifications of 116.7 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, at which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date, or use the materials for Forest Service projects. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
2.)  The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
3.)  The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
4.)  Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
5.)  In Units selected by the Contractor to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)  There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
7.)  Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
8.)  Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
9.)  Wood and Chips which have been stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process, or used by the Forest Service on projects of its own.
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present 	are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer's representative, (COR), will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing is present in many of the units in this project and:
H 4 Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14) Units will not be released for treatment all at one time, but instead will be released as previously worked in units have been completed. Contractor should indicate on the submitted work schedule the sequence of unit release and completion dates at the time of submission of the RFP. 
15.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended.

<DESC>The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around MARCH 8, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.
Description
The project area is located on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest; Clark County, Nevada.  The Project is approximately 21 Air Miles Northeast from Las Vegas on Highway 157. The Project starts at approximately the intersection of Highways 157 and 158 then East for approximately 2 miles on Highway 157. The project can be reached by motor vehicle by leaving Las Vegas on Highway 95 North to the intersection with Highway 157 East. Highway 157 leads to Highway 158. The project area is 69.9 acres. The work requires the pruning to specification of trees, the cutting of trees to specification, and the cutting to specification of shrubs. All cut materials meeting specification are scheduled for removal to a Processing and Storage Area. 
Trees, limbs and shrubs scheduled for removal, will be removed by a Removal Method determined by the successful contract bidder. Materials scheduled for removal can be removed by Helicopter, Yarding Equipment, or by Hand Methods. Other removal methodologies will be considered such as Chipped in Place, or a combination of more than one methodology. All cut materials scheduled for removal that are larger than 3-inches in diameter and 3 foot in length will be transported to a staging area, chipped or otherwise processed into logs and cut logs and then transported to a Designated Processing and Storage Area. Until final acceptance of acreage, units, or the project, the processed cut and chipped materials are the property of the contractor. Upon Final Acceptance of Project, the cut material becomes the property of the US Forest Service. 
Cut materials not scheduled for removal by proposed method of removal are to be piled in preparation for burning by a US Forest Service Fire Crew at a later date.
Depending upon the removal methodology, the Forest Service recognizes that up to 25% of the acreage may not be suitable for removal of all cut materials and transportation to a processing and storage area. Contractor has the opportunity to submit a bid for acres solely cut to specification and piled to specification. 
 The material to be pruned, cut, piled, chipped-in-place, or removed from the unit and transported to a process and storage area are shrubs and small trees. Trees to be pruned are of all diameter classes. Only trees 14-inches or less at 4.5 feet above the ground (DBH) will be cut and are scheduled for removal. Hazard trees above 14-inches DBH will be removed also. The 120 day contract period will be contiguous, and will begin between April 15th (or when the snow has melted sufficiently to allow work) and May 1st.
 This pre-solicitation notice is for a unit-based performance service contract on approximately 69.9 acres, plus mobilization. In Units designated as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal, Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method, Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, The Forest Service will accept and evaluate Proposed Methodology and award the contract to the successful bidder. Prior to submitting a response to the Request for Proposal, contractor will be required to do a Walk Through with the Contract Administrator. The Forest Service may require that a potential successful bidder meet with the Contracting Officer and discuss the contractors proposal. This will be a 120 day contract and no extensions will be granted.

<DESC>The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around MARCH 9, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.

a.	This project involves the following work.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 108.2 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If Contractors proposal includes a yarding system, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date, or may use the materials on Forest Service Projects. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)	In Units selected by the Contractor or designated by the Forest Service to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
8.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
9.)	Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
11)Wood and Chips which have been neatly stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process, or may use the materials on Forest Service Projects
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
12.) Units may contain one or more dry washes or Designated Streams. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes or Designated Streams. Designated Streams are shown on project maps or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
13.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
14.) Residential Housing is present in many of the units in this project and:
H 4 -- Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances is applicable to these areas.
15.)  Access Roads to units and project areas may be primitive and in need of minor repairs. No road improvements will be permitted and access roads that have had work done on them to enable access will be returned to original condition. Any and all work on roads must be approved prior to work being done.
16)  Units in this project will not be released for removal activities all at one time, but instead will be released on a schedule that releases units as previously worked in units are completed. Contractor should indicate on the work schedule submitted with the RFP the sequence of units to be worked in and schedule of work and completion.
17.)   Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended. 

ITEM 125

Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.
It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete removal of all Fire Fuels from the Units, and transported to designated Process and Storage areas. The intent of this contract is to prepare any remaining acres which have piles to be burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel the following Fall and Winter. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.

Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

<DESC>(THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CHANGE THE RESPONSIBLE POINT OF CONTACT TO CHRISTOPHER SCHAUPP.  THE ORIGINAL POST DATE OF 2/4/2010 REMAINS IN EFFECT)

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking lLaboratory Center(s) for the NHLBI DNA Resequencing and Genotyping Service.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS, NOT A  SOLICITATION.

Background

The NHLBI DNA Resequencing and Genotyping (RS&G) Service will provide high quality, high-volume resequencing and genotyping for investigators to discover and type DNA variations needed to elucidate the genetic components involved in the cause, variable outcome and progression of heart, lung, and blood diseases and disorders.  The RS&G Service will consist of two to five Laboratory Centers capable of performing both massively high throughput, large-scale DNA resequencing and high throughput genotyping for heart, lung, and blood investigators; and one Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) to provide the logistical support for the entire RS&G Service.  The ACC will be awarded under a separate solicitation.

Project Requirements

Laboratory Center(s) will provide resequencing and genotyping to investigators involved in heart, lung, and blood research approved to use the RS&G Service.  The LC will need to be able to accommodate a variety of project sizes.  The projects will focus on the genomic regions of potential importance in the disease pathways of heart, lung, and blood disorders.  Specific research is dependent upon the requests from investigators. The LC(s) should expect to receive applications for resequencing candidate genes and regions, and for custom genotyping and genotyping using specialized chips for disease specific questions (vascular disease, lung disease, etc).  In addition, they will be expected to provide support for some animal projects and to incorporate technological advances in resequencing and genotyping as appropriate.

During the entire period of performance, LC(s) will:  (1) provide personnel with expertise and experience in massively parallel DNA resequencing, high throughput genotyping, database management, informatics, general laboratory management, and quality control (QC - used here and throughout encompassing quality assurance and quality control activities); (2) on an annual basis, propose a Performance Assessment Scheme (PAS) for the upcoming period and submit information for evaluation of performance under the applicable PAS to include production, QC for laboratory method, databases, informatics, turn-around times, amount of data submitted to public databases, and increases in production and decreases in cost; (3) provide materials and information promptly and communicate with the ACC frequently and regularly; (4) attend and contribute to Steering Committee meetings (twice a year), monthly conference calls, and subcommittee meetings or conference calls; (5) attend Oversight Committee meetings, provide requested information in a timely manner, facilitate Oversight Committee activities, and respond to comments and suggestions of Oversight Committee; (6) provide in a timely manner technical input to the NHLBI regarding projects submitted for use of the RS&G Service including possible approaches to accommodate varying project designs and to overcome potential complications; (7) communicate frequently and regularly with NHLBI regarding LC activities including any concerns or barriers to performance and work to develop and implement prompt solutions; and (8) assist the ACC as needed to inform the research community of the availability of the RS&G Service, in addition to contributing ideas and information for the RS&G Service website.

<p>Offerors MUST be registered in the Contractor's Central Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement. The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Diana McLain either by email: diana.mclain@gsa.gov or phone number is 215-446-5776.</p>

<DESC>***** Amendment 11*****<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to inform vendors that the program has experienced delays and thus the dates stated in Amendment 10 are no longer valid. Specifically, the CRT-QDP due date has been extended from March 1, 2010 to April 5, 2010. A detailed&nbsp;updated schedule&nbsp;(which will include&nbsp;key milestones/events)&nbsp;will be provided in the CRT-QMP revision.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vendors who have previously requested the CRT-QMP and have been cleared to handle SSI&nbsp;will receive the updated CRT-QMP automatically. All other interested parties will have to follow the process noted in Amendment 10. It is estimated that the vetting process will take up to 10 business days. TSA will not grant vendors additional time for CRT-QMP submission to allow for vetting of a vendor . <br /><br />The procurement will be announced on the FedBizOpps.gov website, but only qualified vendors on the QPL will receive the solicitation.

<DESC>AMENDED DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, supervision, inspection, materials, supplies, parts, tools, equipment, and vehicles required for investigative drilling of exploratory Core Boring (ECP) to locate and define the size of probable voids in the foundation of Joe Hardin Dam (Arkansas River Dam #3). The construction will consist of drilling pilot located in the Arkansas River, at a depth of about 20' average through the dam's stilling basin concrete floor; and performing a conflict camera inspection through the pilot bores; and then possible extending the bores using exploratory borings placed into the foundation materials, to include sampling of foundation soil using an Standard Penetration Test (SPT) sampler and final sealing of all bores in concrete. This project is further clarified for the proposed contractor to perform stilling basin slab subsurface investigation by placing multiple pilot bores, including conducting conflict camera inspection (CCI) via small diameter underwater camera inserted through each Pilot Bore to determine possible conflict with stilling basin floor concrete embedded items, such as wood piling and piling head reinforcement, piping, or joints and water stops.  Pilot bores are to allow access to the foundation subsurface for placing Exploratory Borings. Depending on discovery of possible voids in the foundation, Exploratory Borings may be performed at each approved Pilot Bore Location.  Pilot Bores are also placed to infer installation potential for future features, such as larger inspection Portals or Injection Portals which require placing so that embeds in concrete are not encountered thus potentially halting portal installation or causing unacceptable damage to the structure. To support this work, any contractor submitting a proposal shall provide floating plant and stable platform to allow performing the work of placing pilot bores; performing CCI; Exploratory Borings and sealing of pilot bores and all abandoned bores, including outer casing removal. This project work will proceed incrementally to determine extent of damage along the dam. Work shall be performed in strict accordance with all the terms, conditions, technical specification, drawings, attachments, appendices, Exhibits, etc., contained in the specifications. The Contracting Office is preparing to have one (1) Site Visit (See Solicitation for Details).   F.O.B. Destination, Arkansas River Dam No. 3, McClellan-Kerr Navigation System at river mile 50.2 near Swan Lake, and Pine Bluff, AR  Jefferson and Lincoln counties. Solicitation W9127S-10-R-0016 to be issue o/a 15 March 2010 with closing o/a 15 April 2010. All proposed contractors may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Corps of Engineers. This Acquisition is being issued unrestricted in accordance with FAR Part 19, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program  NAICS CODE 237990/33/5M.  Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm-Fixed Priced.

<DESC>RECOVERY -- INFORMATION NOTICE -- PROJECT 657A5-09-107, RELOCATE/UPGRADE BUILDING 50 GENERATOR AND ELECTRICAL, at the Marion, IL, VA Medical Center.This Special Notice is issued for Informational purposes only.  As such, it does not constitute an actual amendment to the solicitation VA-255-10-RA-0149.  It has been brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer that there is an obvious error in the Proposal Submittal Instruction on pages 7 through 12 of the Solicitation RFP document.  1. This part of the document incorrectly identifies the solicitation number to be VA-255-09-RA-0427, while the correct solicitation number is VA-255-10-RA-0149.  2. This part of of the document also incorrectly identifies the Project to be 589-07-130, Upgrade Emergency Power Building 1  FCA Corrections, at Department of Veteran Affairs, Kansas City, Missouri VAMC.  The correct Project number and description, of course, is 657A5-09-107, Relocate/Upgrade Building 50 Generator and Electrical, at the Marion, IL, VA Medical Center, as indicated in the SF-1442. 3. Under "d. NUMBER OF COPIES TO SUBMIT." offerors are told to label their envelopes with the mistakenly entered project number & description.  Therefore, due to the close proximity of the submittal deadline for this solicitation.  It is hereby noted that if any offerors copied the mistaken project number & description in their envelope labeling, this will not count against them in the proposal evaluation.  If any offerors actually used the correct project number and description in their envelope labeling, that will not count against them, either.  Therefore, if an offeror has already labeled their proposal envelope, they do not need to make any changes, since this obvious typographical error was not at the fault of any offerors.  All offerors should go ahead and label their offer packages however they choose to do so.  This includes both offerors who have already shipped their proposal packages, as well as offerors who are about to ship their proposal packages now.  The bottom line of this informational special notice is to go ahead and label your offer package however you see fit, because it will be accepted however you labeled it, as long as it is received on time.  This does not constitute an amendment.  This is information to be shared with all interested parties.

<DESC>Recovery -  NASA LaRC issued a Task Order to ATK Space Systems, Inc. against theIDIQ contract entitled Technology, AirSTAR Testbed Development and Support. The NASAAirborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research (AirSTAR) facility includes a suite ofcomplex subscale flight vehicle systems and a suite ofcomplex hardware and software systems in its Mobile Operations Station (MOS). Thesesystems  were designed to conduct research through both simulation and flight test ofsubscale remotelypiloted aircraft. The purpose of the research is to advance the state of the art oftechnologies (e.g. flight control theories) that can be used to reduce the number ofairplane accidents fatalities due to loss of control or other related adverse conditions.This purpose aligns with the goals of the NASAAviation Safety Programs Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) and IntegratedResilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) projects. The AirSTAR system will enable flightexperiments on remotely piloted vehicles to explore off-nominal portions of the flightenvelope that are associated with loss of control (LOC) incidents and damage conditions.Such an experimental capability is critical to the design and testing of controlalgorithms that can mitigate damage and recover from upset conditions,as well as other LOC precursors. The vehicles range from commercially available radiocontrol models to custom built and dynamically scaled models of full-scale aircraft. Thesimpler models represent generic flight characteristics and allow for parametric testingover a range of conditions. The dynamically scaled models represent specific flightcharacteristics of full-scale aircraft and have application in validating technologiesfor these vehicles. The Contractor shall perform tasks toprepare aircraft for flight operations in accordance with the attached deploymentschedule. The tasks include mechanical design, loads analysis, airframe modifications,assembly, fabrication, integration, systems and component testing (e.g. updates topropulsive system, control surface servos, landinggear, inertias, etc.). This effort is funded by ARRA funding and is in support of theNASA Aeronautics Research Directorate Aviation Safety Program.

<DESC>The Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) program will develop technologies enabling mission-driven command and control of a heterogeneous team on uninhabited platforms for the conduct of coordinated urban operations. This is a follow-on DARPA effort to research, develop and transition critical technologies that will enable the delivery of real-time, three-dimensional Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) information directly to the end user through the management of manned vehicles and collaboratively controlled unmanned vehicle teams to acquire the information while providing the end user with a non-distracting interface through which RSTA service requests can be expressed without concern for explicitly tasking the individual vehicles or sensors. The vision is that the system will augment the collective autonomy of a team of unmanned platforms by planning their actions as a cooperative team then tasking each platform, through the HART Platform Wrappers, in its own native command representation. In this way, HART exploits the capabilities of each platform-specific ground station technology without modification of already certified airworthy platforms.<br />

<DESC><p>COMPETITION IN CONTRACTING ACT (CICA)<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is delegated the authority by GSA for this acquisition under FMR Guide 2008-B1. A real property lease contract for a port support space and ship berthing space for a 240 foot long research vessel in Rhode Island. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations require facilities to support an oceanic research mission conducted jointly by the Office of Atmospheric Research and the University of Rhode Island at Narragansett. This action is being contracted by the Real Property Management Division under a March 28, 2008 delegation of authority from General Services Administration.</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is interested in leasing approximately 8280 ANSI/BOMA rentable square feet of Class A office space, workshop and warehouse. The term is to be 10 year firm with options for up to a 15 year term with negotiable termination rights by the Government and all appropriate contact clauses. The Government has a requirement for a port support space to meet the mission needs of operating a large research vessel, performing pre and post cruse logistical support and to store, maintain, and perform equipment repairs as needed to operate manned and unmanned submersible craft used to collect data and samples of undersea environmental media.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY'S NEEDS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE:<br />NOAA requires the delivery of an integrated port facility consisting of: Office space 1200 rsf; Warehouse 2400 rsf; Special space (technical shop space) 4200 rsf; Hazmat Storage 480 rsf; Outside parking 30 spaces; Wareyard 0.25 acres (minimum of 2000 sf paved); Large Boat Pier with at least 250 linear feet of berthing area.<br />4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) &#8208; only one responsible source responded to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />Although four sites were identified as potential sites during a homeporting study for the RV Bigelow, a ship of the same class, and two brokers expressed interest verbally or by e-mail interest in responding to the initial request for interest, and only QDC responded in writing on January 30, 2008. A market survey, April 25, 2008, noted that two pier sites, controlled by the QDC can meet the ship berthing requirement and there is sufficient space in existing buildings to meet the facility requirements.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS WERE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:<br />The RV Bigelow homeporting study identified four as potential sites in the North Kingstown, RI area and seven in Providence, RI two years prior to this acquisition (list is attached). An RFI FBO Advertisement was made on January 10, 2008. Explanation of project was provided to two brokers John Capomaccio (independent Broker), and Nancy Vander Lugt of JDL Castle Corporation. They were also provided information for responding to the RFI and forms needed for response to solicitation. FBO Solicitation provided to all preliminarily interested parties</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:<br />The QDC is a not for profit entity that was created by the State of Rhode Island to reuse and revitalize the Quonset Point Naval Air Station that was closed prior to the enactment of the Base Closure and Revitalization program in the Department of Defense. As such it is required to pass through only its costs and overhead. I have reviewed the proposal and subsequent analysis and have concluded that the proposed rental costs are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED AND RESULTS:<br />The QDC was visited on April 25, 2008. It possessed two 1500 foot piers with access to either side giving over 6000 LF of berthing area. This is a commercial port with existing fully implemented port security. The port is used by several foreign car manufacturers as a disembarkation point for motor vehicles for distribution in Eastern North America. The pier meets current fire protection standards. A bulkhead perpendicular to the southern pier has been replaces and affords additional berthing points. The port has several existing warehouse facilities that are adjacent (1250 ft) to the piers. These facilities have 20,000 gsf bays with attached office/restroom areas that can be renovated to meet NOAA's requirements as well as energy star ratings. <br />To the south of the QDC port is another large pier. It has been leased by QDC to a marine construction company and is not available.<br />To the south of QDC is the URI pier was visited. Although long enough, it does not have sufficient water depth nor capacity of utilities and supports smaller research vessels. It also lacks building space. <br />Commercial Fishing pier to the north of QDC lacks pier space and building space.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />There are three significant facts that limit competition. The availability of existing Piers with sufficient space, strength requirements, minimum deck to pier height differentials and minimum depth at low tide limit the total number of sites possible within the ship's homeporting area is limited by geography and bathymetry. The high initial cost and developmental hurdles that require to be crossed prior to delivery. And the need to be in proximity to the University of Rhode Island, a Joint Institute research partner and primary researchers for the mission of ships that will dock at the pier. QDC is also proposing a flat rent with no escalation of operating cost. It is controlling the variability in operating costs by netting them from the lease.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED A WRITTEN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:<br />Quonset Development Corporation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />11. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:<br />To the best of my knowledge and belief, I certify that this justification is accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Approved by:</p>
<p>Andrew C. Duran<br />Real Property Contracting Officer</p>
<p>September 10, 2008<br />Date<br />&emsp;</p>
