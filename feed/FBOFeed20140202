<a href="mailto:Bernadette.J.Kan@nasa.gov">Bernadette J. Kan</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>This request is not a precursor to a solicitation and is intended purely for soliciting information. <P> NASA/GRC is developing a high power, high efficiency Q-band (37-42 GHz) space traveling-wave tube (TWT) having at least 200 watts saturated output power. The application of this TWT will include the development of a transponder for radio wave propagation studies and high data rate communications experiments from a geostationary satellite to Earth. In addition, our study indicates that there could be a market for a TWT with lower power on the order of 40 to 60 watts for commercial communications. Hence, our development goal also includes Q-band space TWTs for wide range of output power (40 to 200 watts) with minor design changes. A similar effort is also planned at V/W-band (71-76 GHz). <P> Description: NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information on potentials plans to move up in frequency into the Q-band and the V/W-band for potential future opportunities for collaboration on advance development, cost-sharing, and/or insertion of the above technologies either as an element of a hosted payload on a satellite or as a stand-alone development for operational satellite systems at Q-band and/or V/W-band frequencies. In particular given the large available bandwidth at these frequencies, NASA Glenn is interested in understanding how these systems can increase science data return from a spacecraft, serve as an alternate to the crowded Ka-band spectrum, serve as a potential commercial source for a future data relay satellite, be a future service provider, and enable communications between satellites and between small science satellites in a constellation, etc. Information on achievable data rates and modulation types for the above applications would be useful. <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for potential future collaboration on opportunities for advance development, cost sharing and/or insertion of the above technologies either as a hosted payload or as a stand-alone development for operational systems. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <P> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of ten to fifteen pages or less indicating the ability to perform various aspects of the effort described herein. <P> Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. <P> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. <P> All responses shall be submitted to Bernadette J. Kan no later than March 7, 2014. Please reference NNC14ZRH004L in any response.	Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $19.0 million.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a potential requirement for service maintenance to be performed on an existing government-owned high through-put analyzer system, which is manufactured by and previously purchased from Illumina, Inc. Annual maintenance shall be provided, including preventive maintenance and a preventive maintenance plan, on the Illumina HiSeq2500 -Silver (serial # 700987).  Subject equipment is operated by the NIA Laboratory of Genetics, located at 251 Bayview Blvd, 04C019, Baltimore, MD 21224.<br /> <br />The Laboratory of Genetics uses the subject sequencer to provide specialized epigenetic functions to analyze exome sequences and genotypes. The  powerful and efficient ultra-high-throughput sequencing system sequences clustered template DNA using synthesis technology that employs reversible terminators with removable fluorescence. The System allows the Lab to generate highly accurate results in under a week for discoveries in genomics, epigenomics, gene expression analysis, and protein-nucleic acid interactions. This sophisticated equipment require frequent visits from service technicians to ensure all components are functioning properly and producing consistent data and results for experiments. Lllumina authorized service technicians will provide emergency repair service, labor, travel, and replacement parts, excluding consumable items, on subject equipment, providing one planned maintenance inspection. Maintenance inspection will include visits to perform tasks; troubleshoot problems, install new software upgrades, train staff and perform preventative maintenance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to find qualified sources with the capacity, expertise, and capability to provide service coverage on the subject equipment. Service providers shall be factory trained, authorized technicians, certified by Illumina, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of the Initiative to Strengthen Local Administrations (ISLA) Program is to strengthen the sub-national government system in Afghanistan to enable the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to improve provincial governance in the areas of fiscal and development planning, representation of citizens, and enhanced delivery of public services.
<p>ISLA program will strengthen sub-national systems in the areas of planning, operations, communication, representation, and citizen engagement. Improvements in these areas, along with the passage of clear, legal sub-national governance (SNG) frameworks by GIRoA will improve GIRoA's ability to prioritize service delivery and develop central plans and budgets that represent provincial interests. This will lead to services that more closely respond to all citizens' needs in health, education, security, justice, and urban services. As all citizens benefit from public services, their perception of government legitimacy will increase. The core problems to be addressed are better integration of provincial priorities into the national plan and budget, and strengthened top-down and bottom-up information flows. The program will work within the existing system to improve its functionality. This will be done by fostering a combination of top-down and bottom-up consultative processes between central and provincial levels to formulate plans and budgets that align with local community service delivery priorities and with national developmental priorities and available resources.</p>
