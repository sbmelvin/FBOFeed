<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine if there are two (2) or more capable Small Businesses that can perform the requirements of the planned contract (base and four (4) option years). For this reason, it is vitally important for Small Businesses to respond to this announcement with highly effective Capability Statements.
<p>Interested firms with capabilities of providing the required services are requested to submit a Capability Statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside in full or in part. The intended procurement will be classified under the North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 611710: Educational Support Services (Educational Testing Services) with a size standard of $14M. All respondents are required to identify their firm's size and type of business.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, is the coordinator within the Federal Government for a wide range of emergency management activities. FEMA is dedicated to working closely with all levels and branches of government, as well as related organizations of the emergency management community to achieve a realistic state of preparedness and an increased capacity to mitigate against, respond to and recover from emergencies of all types.</p>
<p>The agency has numerous roles, including: coordinating government activities; providing planning, grants and technical assistance; guiding and advising various agencies; and delivering training.</p>
<p>FEMA's Emergency Management Institute (EMI) provides both training and technical assistance to State, tribal and local jurisdictions as well as our Federal partners, other government agencies, and associated organizations such as the American Red Cross on a wide variety of topics related to emergency management.</p>
<p>EMI's Independent Study (IS) Program uses alternate delivery formats to provide emergency management training to State, tribal and local officials, Federal partners, and associated organizations in emergency management communities. This program provides free on-demand training that is available through print copy, downloadable format from the Web, or Web interactive and may include CD-ROM, DVD and video materials. There are currently approximately 100 accredited courses through the current contract. These courses result in a combined average annual number of course completions at approximately two-four million. An additional 50 courses are projected to be added to the program annually and will require review for accreditation. It is also projected that approximately 50 existing courses will be revised and will require review for accreditation.</p>
<p>The IS curriculum is increasing and expanding to include additional independent study/self study courses from EMI. The total enrollments fluctuate between two-four million (with approximately three million active student records managed per year).</p>
<p>Receipt, warehousing, inventory, and distribution of IS course materials are conducted by the FEMA Warehouse.</p>
<p>New independent study courses are developed under separate contract(s) and/or Government employees. These courses are submitted to the independent study program contractor for enrollment and student record keeping. This contract does not include development of any independent study courses.</p>
<p>The Capability Statement shall succinctly address the following three items to demonstrate the contractor's capability to perform the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) (attached):<br />(1) The contractor's ability to manage, as prime contractor, the types and magnitude of<br />tasking in the PWS; and<br />(2) The contractor's technical ability, or potential approach to achieving technical ability, to<br />perform at least 50% of the cost of the contract for personnel with its own employees; and<br />(3) The contractor's capacity, or potential approach to achieving capacity, to conduct the<br />requirements of the PWS. For the purposes of this Capability Statement, capacity shall refer<br />to matters such as the magnitude of the tasking, the amount of equipment or facilities<br />involved, and the size of the staff needed. <br />(4) Demonstrated ability to manage, technical ability and capacity includes citing and<br />describing the same or similar relevant performance.</p>
<p>The Capability Statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the following: your ability to manage, technical ability and capacity to meet requirements above. The Capability Statement shall not exceed ten (10) single sided single spaced pages of a font size no smaller than 12 point. The Capability Statement should have attached a minimum of three (3) business references with current contact information (email and phone number) relevant to the primary functions of this requirement as described in the PWS.</p>
<p>Please email your Capability Statement to Laura Harshbarger (laura.harshbarger@fema.dhs.gov) and Gary Topper (gary.topper@fema.dhs.gov) by no later than the close of business (3:00 pm local Washington, DC time) on December 12, 2013.</p>

<p>Sole Source:</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) currently has a rule that requires mandatory reporting of all recreationally landed blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, Atlantic Bluefin tuna, and swordfish. Catch card census programs satisfy the NMFS mandatory reporting rule and provide supplemental catch information. A large pelagics catch card program has been conducted by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) since 1998 with funding and technical support from NMFS. The NCDMF catch card program requires mandatory reporting of certain recreationally landed highly migratory species. Captains or operators of permitted vessels will be required to complete a catch card to be submitted at a reporting station in exchange for a landings tag. A catch card must be submitted for each individual fish landed. Catch cards will be widely available at marinas, state marine resource agencies, large pelagic species tournaments, and other sources.</p>
<p>The NCDMF has been chosen for this project for the following reasons:</p>
<p>This project requires mandatory reporting of Bluefin tuna and billfish landings by boat captains. As the only regulatory agency authorized to change and enforce the State of North Carolina's fishery management regulations, NCDMF is uniquely qualified to enable NMFS to accomplish the goals of this contract.</p>
<p>The success of this project relies greatly on agency outreach efforts aimed at informing and educating captains about the mandatory reporting requirement and how best to meet this requirement. As the state's fishery management agency NCDMF is uniquely qualified to get this message across through their web page, agency issued literature, personal communications, and other means of agency communication.</p>
<p>NMFS and NCDMF have formed a partnership to successfully conduct this project every year since 1998. Continuing this partnership will greatly enhance the quality of the data collected.</p>
<p>In additional NCDNF is a state agency and 16 U.S.C. 1881(d) justifies sole-source contracts specifically to state agencies.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Ames Research Center (ARC) does not plan to recompete contract NNA09DC79C, Research and Technology Development Services (R&T); therefore, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued.  The current Contractor will continue to provide research and development support to the Science Directorate (Code S) until the contract expires on August 31, 2014. &lt;p&gt; Future requirements will be supported under existing contracts such as the recently awarded Project and Engineering Support Services (PESS), Contract NNA13AC87C, the upcoming award of solicitation NNA12412481R, Fully Integrated Lifecycle Mission Support Services (FILMSS), and other existing contracts where the work is determined to be in-scope.  &lt;p&gt; The goal of this procurement strategy is to strengthen ARCs ability to meet the Centers and the Agencys strategic goals for NASA missions by providing continuity, flexibility and competiveness.  A summary of each of the most recent procurements is provided below. These two contracts are needed for the full lifecycle of a mission.  &lt;p&gt; The FILMSS contract will focus on up-front activities (Phase A) necessary to initiate a project, such as integrated mission planning. In Phases B, C and& D.   FILMSS will be the contract mechanism to provide special studies and analyses support for programs/projects and technical authorities.   FILMSS becomes the principal tool to support programs and projects in Phase E as missions enter the operations phase. This acquisition will provide a sustained program and project management capability for missions, instruments, technology development efforts, collaborative science programs, ARC and NASA project offices, and mission and science operations.  Some of the key functional areas on the FILMSS acquisition will be Program Management, Science and Operations and related support for efforts such as ISS Utilization, SOFIA, Kepler, the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the NASA Lunar Science Institute, New Opportunities Center, Science and Research Subject Matter Experts, Planetary Protection, Analysis and Archiving of Mission and Science Data, Educational and Public Outreach, and future Virtual Institutes. &lt;p&gt; The PESS contract will provide multi-disciplinary engineering, testing and fabrication support services for ground based, airborne, and spaceflight hardware and software development and applications for numerous and varied ARC and NASA programs and projects, as well as spacecraft missions design development and analysis.  Some of the key functional areas on the PESS acquisition will be Engineering Design & Analysis, Small Spacecraft and Nanosatellite Mission Design & Analysis, Systems Engineering, Integration & Testing. This consolidated engineering support will focus on project implementation, design and fabrication, or work typically performed in phases B, C and D of the program lifecycle and will include spacecraft missions design development and analysis.  It is our intention that PESS will become the Centers singular engineering contract.  &lt;p&gt; Together, PESS and FILMSS will provide our programs and projects access to all skills and services necessary to promote a consistent, leveraged, and efficient approach to managing the Center's missions.	It is in the best interest of the Government to utilize the current and new contract vehicles at ARC and to not recompete the R&T requirement.  &lt;p&gt; All questions MUST be in writing and should be directed to Veronica L. Gutierrez, Contracting Officer, at Veronica.L.Gutierrez@nasa.gov. &lt;p&gt; Any documents related to above procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA Business Opportunities home page is http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=  . &lt;p&gt; Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC	. &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p><br />1. SOLICITATION NUMBER: 60/2013 <br />2. ISSUANCE DATE: 11/29/2013 <br />3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED <br />FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: 12/18/2013 (6 p.m. Almaty Time) <br />4. POSITION TITLE: USPSC Senior Development Transition Specialist <br />5. MARKET VALUE: $84,697-$110,104 per annum (GS-14 equivalent) with 25% Post Differential (currently) <br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years <br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Kyrgyz Republic, Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, landlocked and mountainous country of Central Asia with a population of just over 5.5 million people. It is the second-poorest country in Central Asia, with one-third of the population living below the poverty line. In the aftermath of the April 2010 violent change in government and the ethnic conflict in the south of the country in June 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic is emerging from a deep political and economic crisis. Significantly, the Kyrgyz Republic was also the first Central Asian state to experience a peaceful and democratic transition of presidential power in 2011. The success of its citizens in building a prosperous, democratic country could have important implications for all of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Despite the country's progress, impediments to development remain, including widespread corruption, low foreign investment, and a high unemployment rate. Approximately one-third of the Kyrgyz Republic's workforce is employed abroad, reducing the available pool of qualified labor. The implementation of democratic and key economic policy reforms remains a challenge, and limited energy resources and low agricultural productivity contribute to insufficient economic growth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the country is moving towards a more stable and representative democratic government that could be a regional model. In collaboration with the Government and people of the Kyrgyz Republic, USAID assistance has helped the country achieve substantial progress in the areas of economic growth, democratic governance, health care reform, improvement of basic education and agricultural development.</p>
<p>USAID has been active in the Kyrgyz Republic since 1992 when it established a USAID Country Office which was managed by USAID's Regional Mission in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Following the political crisis in 2010, and in recognition of the Kyrgyz Republic's importance to US foreign policy goals as well as the key role the country plays in serving as a model for democratic development in the region, USAID elevated the status of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic Office to a full USAID Mission in summer 2013. Currently, the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic Mission is USAID's newest Mission.</p>
<p>B) BASIC FUNCTIONS</p>
<p>The Senior Development Transition Specialist (Specialist) is a senior member of the 27-person team within the two Kyrgyz Republic Offices (23 in Bishkek and 4 in Osh). Under the direct supervision of the Mission Director, the incumbent actively participates in the conceptualization, design and overall management of USAID's programs in the Kyrgyz Republic with a particular emphasis on the economic growth portfolio.</p>
<p>S/he serves as a Mission expert and coordinator in providing intellectual leadership and technical support for cross-cutting issues related to the ongoing development transition in the Kyrgyz Republic. This is a cross-cutting program that includes economic development and social services activities as well as elements of democracy and governance programming such as civil society, governance, media, rule of law, and human rights. The incumbent provides technical assistance and substantive input in the design, implementation and monitoring of projects and serves as a key advisor to the USAID Mission Director, particularly in the area of economic growth programming and policy issues given that over 60% of the Mission's funding is focused on the economic growth portfolio. Additionally, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has also stressed economic growth as its top priority in its 2013-2017 national strategy with which USAID/Kyrgyz Republic's 2013-2017 Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) is tighly aligned. The incumbent also serves as a critical senior level manager and mentor to USAID/Kyrgyz Republic's technical teams, again with a special emphasis on economic issues, as well as to USAID's office in Osh, located in the south of the country. Additionally, from time to time, the incumbent may be called upon to serve as Acting Deputy Mission Director. She/he is responsible for assisting in oversight and management of an assistance portfolio of approximately $45 million annually, which is implemented through approximately 30 institutional contractors and grantees.</p>
<p>S/he reports to the USAID/KR Mission Director, and supervises one USPSC and at least three FSN staff. Due to the cross-cutting nature of the portfolio, the incumbent advises all Mission staff on issues pertaining to conflict management. S/he will play a role in strategic planning and donor coordination, report writing, as well as in managing resources and working with implementing partner.</p>
<p>The range of responsibilities and functions are outlined below.</p>
<p>C) DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Senior Development Specialist may from time to time assume the responsibilities and authority of the Mission Director in his/her absence. This requires that the incumbent be fully familiar with all programs and activities, the issues and objectives involved, implementing partners, other donors, and local counterparts, including high level officials. As needed, the Mission Director may delegate specific responsibilities or assignments to the incumbent, on either a short-term or long-term basis. The incumbent is also required to travel on an as-needed basis within the Kyrgyz Republic to monitor USAID activities and to travel, as well, to the USAID/CAR Regional Mission office in Almaty, Kazakhstan, to coordinate and consult with management and technical support office staff at the regional level. Given that USAID/Kyrgyz Republic as well as the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic both prioritize economic growth as a top issue and that 60% of USAID/Kyrgyz Republic's program budget targets economic growth issues, the incumbent will be required to play a key role in advising the Mission Director and Economic Growth Office Director on issues, opportunities and program implementation in the economic sector.</p>

<p>4) Take the lead for the Mission in program management/administration in terms of the Kyrgyz Republic's budget and reporting processes, including tracking and maintaining budget information, as well as coordinating all information for reporting purposes, with responsible Regional Mission staff as well as Embassy personnel, as appropriate;</p>
<p>6) Supervise and play an important part in the Public Outreach efforts of the Mission. This includes: assisting in the development of newsletters and press releases on assistance programs, establishing a close working relationship with the Public Affairs section in the U.S. Embassy, and ensuring that all outreach and media materials are of a high quality.</p>
<p>7) Serve as a liaison official for dissemination of information on USG assistance with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the U.S. Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic, and international donor organizations;</p>
<p>8) Identify opportunities to maximize the contribution of USAID assistance to USG foreign policy priorities. Advise the Mission and USAID/CAR's Regional office of these needs, and as required, develop concept papers outlining the potential USAID response. The incumbent keeps the Mission Director apprised of issues, problems, successes and solutions in the management of USAID's program in the Kyrgyz Republic, with a particular emphasis on economic issues.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification.

Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p><br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management<br />Material Handling<br />Engineering<br />Quality Assurance<br />Security<br />Planning and Estimating<br />Housekeeping<br />Transportation/Drivers<br />Contract Administration<br />Testing<br /><br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's</p>
<p>(c) accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(d) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised</p>
