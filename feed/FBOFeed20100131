<p dir="ltr" align="left">The contractor shall conduct interviewing, data processing, and data file documentation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Interviewing shall be conducted from mid-2011 to mid-2019, based upon approximately 5,000 completed interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age in the household population of the United States. In summary, the contractor shall perform the following tasks, working in close, continuing collaboration with the NCHS/NSFG staff:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;(1) design a national sample that will yield about 5,000 interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews), with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(2) program and test questionnaires for males and females;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(3) prepare advance letters, consent forms, and other survey field materials;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(4) recruit, hire, and train interviewers;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(5) conduct all interviews in person, typically in respondents' homes, collecting signed consent for the interview for all respondents, and signed parental consent for interviews with 15-17 year olds;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(6) achieve a 75% weighted response rate for both men and women;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(7) Use laptop computers to conduct the interviews, and send the (encrypted) data electronically to the contractor's central office as promptly as possible;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(8) Prepare 3 public use data files based on every 2-3 years of interviewing</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(a public use file must be based on at least 12,000 interviews);</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(9) Prepare Series 1 ("Plan and Operation") and Series 2 ("Sample Design, weighting, imputation, &amp; variance estimation") reports to describe the work that was done.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">(10) Keep the data safe, secure, and confidential.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;Thus, this contract will require the collection of a wide range of complex and sensitive data, in person, in English and Spanish, from national samples. The data must measure trends &amp; differences among the total population &amp; important sub-groups, with a response rate that gives its users confidence in the results, and at a cost that NCHS can afford. The contractor must also meet requirements for Certification and Accreditation for IT security under FISMA and other applicable laws.</p>

<DESC>Notice of the Intent to Award a Sole-Source Procurement. The Government intends to award a sole-source purchase order to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, and certifications necessary to repair a John Deere backhoe/loader. Repair will be provided by Honnen Equipment Company. The place of performance will be 5055 E. 72nd Ave., Commerce City, CO 80022.

The anticipated amount of the repairs are $12,160.00. The 460th Contracting Squadron, Buckley AFB, CO, intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-2(a)(2) Unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Questions should be directed to Ms. Debra Saumur, Acquisition Support, in writing via e-mail at deb.saumur.ctr@buckley.af.mil or telephone (720) 847-9390, or A1C Matthew Duane, Contract Specialist, at matt.duane@buckley.af.mil or telephone (720) 847-6674.
