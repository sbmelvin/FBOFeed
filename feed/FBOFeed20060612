TITLE: Designing, providing, installing electronic monitoring systems aboard pollock catcher vessels in the Bering Sea.  
 
This acquisition is open to full and open competition.

OBJECTIVE: 
The objective of this project is to test the applicability of a video based electronic monitoring (EM) system for monitoring specific types of fishing activities on vessels participating in Alaskan groundfish fisheries.  We seek proposals for the lease and installation of EM systems on between 5 and 12 vessels fishing off Alaska as well as the review and analysis of the data collected.

DESCRPTION:
The Government intends to acquire the vendor to design, provide, and install electronic monitoring (EM) systems aboard pollock catcher vessels in the Bering Sea. EM systems are required to have capability of determining if and when discard (discard is discard of catch and bycatch of catcher vessels fishing for Pollock) occurs and analyze the video data to determine specifically when and what type of discard events occurs.  The systems shall be installed on approximately 5 to 12 vessels fishing out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. This will require the vendor to install the EM in a harsh marine environment on the vessels. The vendor may require the installation of EMís on multiple vessels at multiple locations during the same time period. 

Anticipated period of performance is approximately 12 months.    

This acquisition is open to full and open competition.

<DESC>The Department of Justice intends to acquire on a sole source basis various models of Integrated Ballistics Identification Systems (IBIS) from Forensic Technology, Inc. (FTI), One Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC.  The acquisition will also encompass IBIS support services such as installation, training, documentation, and maintenance.  The IBIS are automated computer ballistic imaging systems used in criminal justice investigations to examine and analyze ballistic evidence.  The contract with FTI will support the mission of DOJís International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), and the ballistic imaging systems will primarily be installed in countries in which ICITAP is assisting in the development or improvement of  criminal justice systems (although some may also be installed in the United States).  So that ICITAP can provide state-of-the-art forensic technology with access to the most important and useful ballistic databases, the imaging systems it acquires must be 100% compatible (in terms of  interfacing, communications, and data exchange, to cite a few examples) with the FTI IBIS systems used in the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) programs of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives.  Since FTIís IBIS are based on software proprietary to FTI, we believe that ICITAPís requirements can only be met by FTI.  No solicitation document exists.  Interested parties must submit a detailed written response that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that they have the capability to provide automated ballistic imaging systems that will meet ICITAPís needs, and that they can install and maintain their systems abroad and in the United States.  Responses received as a result of  this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or bids, and cost or pricing data are not solicited.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated period of performance under the resultant contract will be a base year with four (4) one-year option periods.  See Numbered Note 22.

The estimated value of this project is CZK 200 million ($8.9 million USD). The Host Nation reference for the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is 1999/2PL22003-0. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFB-CZECH-1999-2PL22003.

Before issuing the IFB, the host nation will verify technical and financial information with use of a Questionnaire. Failing to answer or answering inadequately any of the questions may be a reason for exclusion from further participation in the ICB. 

The IFB will be issued to firms for which a Declaration of Eligibility has been submitted; a NATO security clearance certificate has been provided; financial and technical eligibility have been proven (Questionnaire); and a fee of CZK 30,000 ($1,335 USD) has been paid for the use of reproduction equipment. (Account number, place and deadline of the payment will be shown in the instructions, which will be sent to all eligible firms after verification of the technical and financial information provided in the Questionnaire.)

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: June 15, 2006

2. Estimated date for distribution of technical and financial verification Questionnaire: July 3, 2006

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) through the Contracts Directorate at the Marine Corps Systems Command has a requirement to obtain contractor support services in  support of the continued engineering testing support of the XM-326 Dragon Fire II (DF II).  The requirements associated with this effort are as follows: 1.0	SCOPE.  This synopsis delineates the tasks to be performed to support the continued engineering testing support of the XM-326 Dragon Fire II (DF II) to refine and prepare the system to achieve full functionality for all charges, all directions in a tactical environment. The XM-326 is being tested as a dedicated counterfire response system for the United States Army Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) system and this testing must be completed as soon as possible to make the XM-326 available for force protection.  2.0	BACKGROUND.  The 120 millimeter XM-326 DF II is being developed as a concept demonstrator system to explore the benefits of advanced technology for indirect fire systems. Based on the seven yearsí of experimentation with Dragon Fire I, certain new technologies were shown to improve precision and responsiveness of artillery systems; however, a new system had to be designed to encompass the operational ìlessons learnedî from the first design.  As an example of this, the weight of the Mobile Fire Support System (MFSS) was 6,900 pounds and has proven to be too heavy to safely tow behind the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The new weapon is completed and based on its design capabilities for very fast response and high precision, it is being tested as a potential dedicated counterfire system for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system and to serve as an advanced technology counterfire system in combat. 3.0 CONTRACTOR SUPPORT.  The XM-326 requires the support of engineers and technicians to support, prepare and maintain the XM-326 during the safety and engineering tests being conducted at Yuma Proving Ground AZ. 3.1	Provide engineering support for the electric actuator system of the XM-326 during engineering and safety testing. 3.1.1	Test and prepare the XM-326 electric actuator systems at a site to be determined prior to the firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground. (parts and materials) 3.1.2	Provide three engineers/technicians to support the XM-326 engineering preparations for and field assistance to, the firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground AZ (3 engineers, 2 weeks plus travel and TAD expenses) 3.2	 Provide engineering support for the electric actuator system of the XM-326 during the teardown and inspection of the XM-326 at Rock Island Arsenal IL. 3.2.1	Provide support for the US Army Armament Research Design and Engineering Command team at Rock Island Arsenal while the XM-326 is disassembled and inspected after the safety and engineering tests. Engineers will inspect their actuator system and associated electronics and update, repair, and modify as required based on that inspection. One week of support by three engineers at Rock Island Arsenal.  3.2.2	Provide a written report of the findings of the actuator system and any modifications/repairs at the conclusion of the teardown and inspection.  3.3	Provide four (4) Actuator Controller Amplifier Boards as spare parts for the testing and other spare parts as required to maintain the actuator system. 3.3.1	Provide four (4) fully connectorized Actuator Controller Amplifier Boards to allow rapid installation in case that system fails during testing and as spare parts for further firings.  3.3.2	Provide spare parts/repair of actuator components if they fail during the system testing.  4.0	DELIVERABLES 4.1  Complete actuator test preparations for the XM-326 at a site to be determined prior to safety and engineering tests at Yuma Proving Ground.   4.2  The contractor shall provide engineering support for the GD-OTS actuator system at Yuma Proving Ground during the safety and engineering tests.  4.3  The contractor shall provide engineering support for the teardown and inspection of the XM-326 at Rock Island Arsenal.  4.4  The contractor shall provide four (4) fully connectorized Actuator Controller Boards plus additional parts for the support of the XM-326 testing and as spares for the system.  4.5  The contractor shall provide sufficient spare parts and repair of the actuator system during testing at Yuma Proving Ground, and the tear down reinspection and reassembly at Rock Island Arsenal, IL.   4.6  The contractor shall provide an engineering test report in both printed and electronic media that contains the test results and the recommended modifications to the actuator system if needed.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA intends to procure on a sole source basis, from Datagate Inc., Carson City, Nevada, maintenance services for the Harpoon Missile Subsystems Test Sets (MSTS). The Harpoon MSTS operates on the Hewlett Packard 9500D series (HP9500D-354) computer system.  Numerous foreign countries have procured Harpoon Weapon Systems under the FMS program, and the MSTS are located at the foreign country's weapon station. The contractor will be required to maintain a fully operational Missile Subsystems Test Set (MSTS) for the Harpoon missile.  It will require support in the areas of technical and diagnostic documentation updates, technical consultation, depot repair, on site engineering and provision of an emergency spares pool.  The locations of support will be conducted at various foreign weapon stations in pursuant to the Department of the Navy Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Program under the Long-Term Support (LTS) agreement !  for the Harpoon MSTS.  They shall also be required to maintain a fully operational HP9500D-354 Mock-up system to assist in resolving weapon station MSTS failures. The HP9500D-354 is obsolete and Datagate acquired all of the remaining equipment, spare parts and data rights from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Hewlett Packard. This makes Datagate Inc. the only known contractor with the unique capability to meet the Navy's minimum needs.  No other source has the required MSTS mock-up, spare parts, and software to accomplish the effort. The anticipated period of performance will be for 36 months commencing on 1 October 2006 and continuing through 30 September 2009. Any resultant contract will contain the clause FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to: Attn: Timothy Byrnes, Contracts Competency, Code 230000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 "I" Avenue, Suite 1, P!  oint Mugu, CA  93042-5049.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to enter into negotiations for a firm fixed price contract on an other than full and open competition basis with Dewetron, Inc., PO Box 1460, Charlestown, RI 02813 for Dewetron Data and Video Acquisition System. Delivery of the items is FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA.  Award will be issued under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR 13.5).  This requirement is limited to the Dewetron, Inc. because 1. It can record up to 64 analog input channels at rates of up to 200 kHz/channel continuously, and record NTSC or RS170/A video simultaneously and in sync with the analog data. 2. It can display all 64 analog input channels in strip chart and numeric form and the video feed in a "live" on-screen presentation, where all data sources are shown simultaneously.  3. It has analog inputs with true 24-bit resolution utilizing sigma-de!  lta ADC technology, with separate ADC's (analog to digital converters) per channel, and 100-pole analog anti-aliasing filters before the digitizing process on every channel.  4. It can record and translate IRIG time code and synchronize the data recording to absolute IRIG time.  5. It records data natively to DSD format data files, which must be compatible with existing equipment deployed at various sites.  DSD is a file format invented by Dewetron, which makes synchronized recording of analog and video data possible, and which is proprietary to Dewetron. Data files recorded on one Dewetron instrument can be easily loaded onto any other Dewetron system for analysis and review. In addition, configuration/setup files are also transportable among Dewetron machines.  6. Removable hard disk(s) on the front panel for data, and a second removable hard disk on the rear panel for the operating system and applications. Internal hard drives are not acceptable due to the processing of !  classified data. The Dewetron platform has been specifically engineere d for this environment.   The system must be able to record dynamic analog inputs and video, and present them in a seamless synchronized and simultaneous fashion, where they are locked together automatically during both recording and replay. Non-synchronized methods and systems are not acceptable because they make frame-by-frame data review and analysis a painstaking and intensive manual-labor process. It is also critical that the system' configuration/setup files and more importantly the DATA FILES, be compatible for exchange with other equipment deployed at various sites that are conducting these tests on the same or similar systems.  Any firms believing they can provide a system that meets the above mentioned items may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than ten days after this notification is published.  Responses shall provide documentation to include brochures and/or literature that show they can meet the requirements stated in the synopsis.  All requests must reference RFQ Number N68936-06-R-0099.  These responses shall be submitted in writing to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Attn: Adam R. Kitay, 429 E. Bowen Rd - Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.  Questions may be addressed to Adam R. Kitay (760) 939-1732, adam.kitay@navy.mil.   NAICS Code = 334513 Place of Performance  =  N/A Set Aside  =  N/A

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) STA 409 CD Test System which is a Simultaneous Thermogravimetric (TG), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA)system. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Netzsch Instruments only.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	The 25g capacity Netzsch system has a minimum 5microgram resolution; thereby making it more accurate than other systems.  The Netzsch system is designed with the microbalance at the bottom of a T and the DSC-TG pans sit on top of the T in special circular receptacles - there are no hang-down wires.  This top-loading design supports the natural gas flow path, keeping solids from forming on the microbalance. Gases rise up and are carried out the top of the furnace, away from the microbalance.  Netzsch Instruments, Inc. is the only known company with this design combined with the 5 microgram resolution and 25g capacity.	Its competitors' design has an inverted T with the microbalance above and the pans are at the bottom which contribute to solids forming the sample carrier stem and on the microbalance and also contribute to the system becoming increasingly less accurate over time. There are no other systems that have the combination of maximum capacity, resolution, and accuracy as the Netzsch system.  2.	The Netzsch system has the capability to run large volume TGís up to 3.4ml with a thermocouple mounted directly underneath the TG sample crucible and another in the wall of the furnace. This allows someone to see exothermic and endothermic reactions of the sample comparing the difference in temperatures of the two thermocouples. This is a patent pending design called Calculated DTA software that allows someone to calibrate the TG by using melting points of metals, which is a lot more accurate than using curie points with magnetic fields that competitors use.  It is important to have accurate calibration of the system so that the behavior of materials can be appropriately characterized.	No other systems have this capability. 3.	The Netzsch system has quick release sensors that must be changed when going from low to high volume pans which are much easier than competitor systems.	This allows for minimal operator training and operation time resulting in lower cost operations.  No other system with this capacity, resolution, accuracy, and Calculated DTA has this capability. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 20, 2006.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology:  an ultrasonic-based inspection system that measures stress and strain in sections of bent or bulged pipe useful in the determination of safe operating pressure and suitability for continued service.  The non-contact device traverses the pipe internally or externally and can both rapidly detect the damaged region and characterize the degree of deformation by providing a measure of the effective plastic strain.  It provides advantages over dimensional measurement techniques by providing a sophisticated and accurate measurement of acoustic material properties directly related to the mechanical properties of the pipe.  Excellent for comparison of pre- and post-deformation and resulting changes in operating strength.  Suitable for measuring damage from subsidence, earth movement, and wind induced vibration.  The inspection system offers proactive monitoring for incident prevention and can extend the service life of pipelines by avoiding premature repairs or replacement.  The system is also useful in the ranking of the severity of pipeline dent damage based on changes to the materials properties and the presence of residual stress and plastic strain.   Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the companyís business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) hereby issues this synopsis for commercial item services for food services and cafeteria management for the TSA cafeteria located at 701 South 12th Street in Arlington, Virginia.  This facility services TSAís employees, contractors and guests, and is not open to the general public.  The TSA intends to solicit technical proposals and award a no-cost contract for these services by mid-August of 2006.  

The incumbent Contractor for this effort is the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired.  Although there is an incumbent, the TSA will consider and encourages innovative and creative approaches to meeting the agencyís requirements for the cafeteria.

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on June 22, 2006.  This is a full and open RFP and all interested companies are invited to participate regardless of business size.  Those interested parties may contact Quyen Diep via email at Quyen.Diep@dhs.gov for a copy of the RFP.  Any amendments, questions and answers, or clarifications regarding this solicitation will be posted solely to the Government Point of Entry at www.fbo.gov prior to RFP closing due date and time  Interested parties are encouraged to check www.fbo.gov frequently for possible updates.

Prior to the issuance of the RFP, the TSA will hold a walk-through of the cafeteria for interested parties on June 19, 2006 from 3:00pm to 5:00pm EST and on June 20, 2006 from 3:00pm to 5:00pm EST.

3.	The number of attendees and the names of each.

Due to space limitations, only two representatives from each offeror will be allowed to attend the walk-through.  Interested parties are advised of the following security procedures at TSA:

Please arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the start of the event at 601 South 12th Street.  Street parking is extremely limited and garage parking rates may range from $2-$4 per hour, so Metro is highly encouraged.  Attendees should proceed to the Visitorís Center at 601 South 12th Street to check-in.  TSA Security will log in all visitors and issue temporary badges.  This process can cause delays so interested parties are encouraged to arrive early.  Visitors will be escorted to the TSA cafeteria by a member of TSAís staff.  Visitors are cautioned that they must be escorted at all times by a member of TSAís staff while in TSA spaces.  Failure to abide by TSAís visitor procedures may result in expulsion from TSA spaces.  

Please note that attendance is not mandatory for responding to the RFP but is highly encouraged.  No phone number will be provided for call-in participation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM- Picatinny Arsenal, NJ has a requirement for sixteen (16) Enhanced Cover Assemblies. This firm fixed price purchase order is for the  development of an enhanced cover for the current square rim ammunition  container to redesign for weight savings as well as improve Insensitive  Munitions (IM) performance. The Army is looking to decrease/lighten the amount  of packaging material used for ammunition.  When ammunition is packed for  transport, usually you will max out in weight before cubing out, fill up  useable volume.  To increase the amount of ammunition transported the weight  from either the ammo or packaging must be reduced.  Since design changes in  ammunition is more complex than packaging, it is logical to try and reduce as  much weight as possible from the packaging while keeping its functionality and  still protect the item/s inside.  The enhanced cover will reduce the weight as  well as allow room to incorporate Insensitive Munitions (IM) feature. The  competitive Request for Quote (RFQ) will be available electronically at the  following Internet address: http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about fifteen  (15) days from date of this announcement. The point of contact for this  requirement is Mr. Thomas Howes, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Bldg. 10,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; email: thomas.howes1@pica.army.mil ,  telephone number: 973-724-2962. SEE NUMBER NOTE 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the  authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and  capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of  intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals  received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an  existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis  will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to  compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is  solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will  normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is the Armys premier integrator of space and missile defense capabilities and, as such, has been directed to deliver assigned Army capabilities acro ss the full spectrum of warfare from concept to warfighter.   In support of air, space, and missile defense, the USASMDC/ARSTRAT executes a requirement to fulfill advisory and assistance services under the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contr acts (SETAC) program.  The contractor will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and Other Government Agencies related to air,  space, and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The SETAC scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to have nine (9) functional areas:  (1) Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning; (2) Technology Development, Sys tem Development, Assessment, and Validation; (3) Threat Estimation/Projections; (4) Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimation; (5) Modeling, Simulation and Interfacing; (6) Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; (7) Production a nd Fielding Support; (8) Homeland Defense and Homeland Security; and (9) Warfighter Support.  The anticipated competition will allow for seven (7) Full and Open Awards: 2 Reserved for Woman-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for 8(a) Business; 2 Reserved for Small Business; and 1 Full and Open without Reservation.   This acquisition will result in multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbur sable travel and materials line items.   Period of performance for the resultant acquisition will be a five (5)-year Basic contract and anticipates the potential of an additional five (5) one (1)-year options.  It is anticipated that the requirements will be executed via task orders issued, based  on actual customer requirements. The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC  contract. To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interest s, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual performance.	  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710/1000 employees.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The expected release date of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 2 6 June 2006.  Schedule, OCI clauses, draft RFP, and any other draft documents/information will be posted and updated on the USASMDC SETAC07 website http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/SETAC07.html.   NO PAPER COPIES OF THE DRAFT RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE DRAFT RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.

<SOLNBR>W9113M-06-R-0017
<RESPDATE>103106
<ARCHDATE>12302006
<CONTACT>Robbie Phifer, 256-955-3693
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) requires an integration contractor team to plan, organize and coordinate operations/tests/analyses with comprehensive, widely distributed experimental w eapons systems, or credible representations thereof, such as Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense hardware/element labs, early warning radars, sea-based missile defense elements, mid and lower tier missile defense elements, or representative element simu lations; and/or other equipment of interest, such as communications network hardware/simulation, command and control, and/or threat systems data.  Combinations may include, but are not limited to items such as weapons system Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) lab oratories, Software-in-the-Loop (SWIL), detailed (up to and including detailed engineering level) modeling and simulation (M&S) products, trustworthy databases reflecting detailed weapon system operations, threat system representations and /or any other as set required, for integrated test and analysis experiments.   Initial emphasis is expected by SMDC/ARSTRAT to be placed upon but not be limited to all varieties of missile defense operations (and related offensive operations) against threats in all phases of operational envelopes. Test and analysis experimental configurations are customer driven in accordance with directly stated objectives or derived from senior leadership expectations.  To perform this scope of work (SOW), SMDC/ARSTRAT and the ITAC contra ctor shall seek out partnerships with DoD and other US Government organizations (and their lead contractor organizations) to obtain the requisite capabilities.  Task orders will be issued by the SMDC/ARSTRAT to accomplish the ITAC requirements.  Several US  Government supported efforts are expected to be integrated into the performance of this contract through the use of directed subcontractors to the ITAC prime contractor. Each present or future Directed subcontractor is precluded from participating as a me mber of the prime team.  The Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) developed by Teledyne Brown Engineering is expected to be heavily leveraged with the ITAC tasks, but the scope of ITAC is more comprehensive than just existing (circa 2006) MDSE operation s.  Likewise, the Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense Embedded Test (ET) capability developed by the Boeing Company is expected to be leveraged along with the Integrated System Test Capability (ISTC) resources and US Government supported contractor rada r laboratories operated by the Raytheon Company.  The center for these activities is expected to be at Government facilities that have yet to be identified. The anticipated competition will be a small business set-aside and will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a period of performance of five years with one five-year option. It is anticipated that the requirements wil l be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements. ITAC integration tasks shall revolve around (but not be limited to) the following core functions: program and task management; derive specific ITAC requirements from customer even t definitions; purchase task-enabling hardware, software, network, or any other material items; integrate geographically distributed customer-specified assets into acceptable test and analysis event configurations; provide operational networks of HWIL, SWI L, communication linkages, etc.; perform functional and qualification testing; perform and/or assist customer agents with event operations; arrange for data collection, storage, processing, and delivery; assist independent verification, validation, accredi tation, and qualification agents; and assist independent configuration management agents.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (AXK) invites prospective contractors to review the Draft Request for Proposal FA8802-05-R-0003 which will be released in May 2006. An Industry Day will be held on 25 May 2006 at SMC, Bldg 270, Daedelion Room from 1430 ñ 1600. Please contact Capt Michael Ahn at (310) 653-1347 to RSVP. It is anticipated that the DRFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the Industry Day.

It is the intent of SMC/AXK to establish SAS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Space and Missiles Systems Center Acquisition Support by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Engineering Services (PES) 871-6 Multiple Award Schedule Contracts (Acquisition and Life Cycle Management). There is no closing date for this announcement. The NAICS Code for this action is 541710, paragraph 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. All SAS Delivery Orders will be 100% set-aside for small business participation only. SMC/AXK allows contractors to form teaming relationships for this effort. In order to receive a SAS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA FSS 871-6, PES FSS.  In order to be a qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA PES 871-6 Schedule.  The SAS requirement is for the acquisition of Acquisition Planning, manpower, Manpower, Personnel, Training and Administration, Configuration and Data Management, and Contracting Support.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be through 30 Sep 2011.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders. To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA.  In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the government.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award. Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance. The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded. The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments or the contractor's facility.

<ARCHDATE>06122007
<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>THE U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for the analysis of Phytoplankton Surface Water Samples.  A significant component of an interpretive project investigating the effects of anthropogenic changes in circulation patterns on the water-quality in Lake Houston, TX is the yearly and event driven changes in algal biovolume. Monthly and event driven samples at multiple locations and depths will be sampled throughout the year for algal species and biovolume. The length of this study and the amount of samples requires a laboratory with the capability to process a significant number samples as well as be able to insure consistency in species counts by removing personal biases associated with samples processed by more than one researcher. Data will be collected for about one-year. PhycoTech, Inc. is currently being used by other USGS projects investigating phytoplankton in Texas lakes. In order to compare the phytoplankton analytical results for these USGS projects, similar analytical methods and similar persons making the algal counts is needed. The ability to compare algal speciation and biovolumes across the region is an important component to understanding the mechanism controlling temporal changes in algal growth and decay rates. PhycoTech, Inc. is the only known lab that could provide the turnaround time needed. Although 6 weeks for regular samples is fairly standard throughout the labs contacted, the 2-4 weeks or less turnaround for the event samples seemed to be a more difficult timeframe to hit for other labs. The rapid turnaround for the event samples is needed so that dominant alagal species can be associated with taste and odor chemical constituents. As stated above, the same lab and researcher would be required to analize both the regular and event samples to insure comparability. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from: Phycotech, LTD, 620 Broad Street, Suite 100, St. Joseph, MI 49085 and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, (Reclamation), Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Ottawa Engineering Limited, 2747 Priscilla St., Ottawa, ON K2B7E1, Canada.  This purchase order is for follow-on consulting services for Refinement of Concept for Upper Molokai Water Supply Pipeline Hydropower Plant, Island of Molokai, Hawaii.  Reclamation has a need for a more detailed analysis, or Refinement of Concept, of the Molokai Irrigation System Water Supply Pipeline.  In the sping of 2005, Ottawa Engineering Limited completed a preliminary assessment of small hydropower potential on State managed irrigation systems on Molokai and the Island of Hawaii.  Again in the fall of 2005, Ottawa Engineering Limited, completed a Refinement of Concept investigation of a small hydro plant at the Molokai pipeline outfall and determined that there was some potential to exceed pipeline pressure standards.  They then completed a preliminary assessment of a small hydro plant located about 3,000 feet from the beginning of the pipeline.  This potential small hydro plant location, the Upper Molokai Water Supply Pipeline Hydropower Project, will be the subject of the Refinement of Concept under this purchase order.  It is considered to be cost effective and in the best interest of the Government to award this follow-on purchase order to Ottawa Engineering Limited.  This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is June 20, 2006. Questions may be directed to Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8642 or e-mail to:  lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 and the size standard is six million dollars.

<CONTACT>Steven Lehman, Code 631, email: steven.lehman@navy.mil Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock PNBC-Bldg. 1000 Attn: Steven Lehman, P.E. 5101 South 18th Street Philadelphia, PA 19112-5083
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Philadelphia, PA (NSWCCD-SSES, Code 631) is soliciting manufacturers of oil-water separators and/or oil pollution abatement systems that would be interested to partner, further develop, and commercialize NSWCCDís design for an automatic oil pollution abatement system (AOPA). The automatic oil pollution abatement system includes: 1) Automatic Oily Waste Transfer System (AOWT). 2) Primary Oil-Water Separator System (Gravity Unit). 3) Secondary Treatment System (Ceramic Membrane Ultrafiltration Unit). The overall goals of the planned Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) are as follows: 1) Establish a cooperative agreement and then a manufacturing license agreement with an interested partner, to develop and supply the AOPA System and support one-stop-shopping for shipbuilding customers;  2) Develop system modules, options that may include variable process rates, and customize the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC ñbased main controllers); 3) Develop a completely integrated AOPA System that uses the AOWT system, a gravity parallel plate OWS with model VS-50R controls, qualified materials, and field devices, and a secondary treatment system with a by-pass option; 4) Develop small capacity oilñwater separator system(s)  (e.g., 5 gpm and 10 gpm) with a primary unit based upon the VS-50R OWS control and design architecture or equivalent, and a qualified secondary unit operation, which would be integrated to the overall automatic OPA  ìsmartî system; 5)  Desi!  gn, develop, test, and incorporate improvements into the AOPA system based on NAVSEA in-service engineering (ISEA) knowledge, and partner experience; 6) Simplify AOPA System logistics for U.S. Naval Ships; and 7) Finalize partnering and financial obligation issues, and review the transfer of intellectual property and statement of work that addresses responsibilities for tasks.  the automated oily waste transfer (AOWT) system has been designed and developed to provide a fully automated, smart system that addresses known shortcomings, limitations, problems, and safety issues that are either well recognized, or may not be readily apparent, for existing manually operated Navy (and potentially commercial) shipboard oily waste transfer systems. In addition, the primary oil-water separator (OWS) is a fully integrated oil pollution abatement (OPA) system. This OWS is a programmable logic controller (PLC)-based, multi-staged shipboard environmental system that automatically manages and processes shipboard generated oily wastewater from an oily waste holding tank (OWHT) to ultimately discharge clean water overboard while retaining separated bulk waste oil in a waste oil tank (WOT). The overall OWS system would include the qualified gravity separator, a secondary polisher unit, and an oil content monitor unit.   Interested parties are requested to submit technical design and manufacturing experience for oil pollution abatement (OPA) systems, principal staff capabilities, product types currently manufactured, list of customers, and points of contact information. Submittals are to be no more than 5 pages in length. Responses to this synopsis shall be sent to: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Code 631, PNBC, Bldg. 1000, Attn: Steven B. Lehman, P.E., 5101 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19112-5083. If this information is available online, send the web address to steven.lehman@navy.mil.  This synopsis is for information purposes only to identify potential Navy Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners. It does not constitute an RFQ and does not obligate the Government in any way to purchase any of the systems to be offered.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that will soon be conducted for which the scope will be research leading to a revised draft of National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard-0104.02, Riot Helmets and Face Shields that reflects new threats and performance requirements.  

BACKGROUND OF PROPOSED ACQUISITION

The Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts a number of projects under its Weapons & Protective Systems program.  These projects focus on the establishment of improved performance standards and test methodologies for various types of equipment used by law enforcement, corrections, and criminal justice agencies.  This specific requirement addresses a need to revise NIJ Standardñ0104.02.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE OF SERRVICES TO BE ACQUIRED

Protective clothing and equipment for use in potentially violent situations is intended to prevent or reduce the severity of injuries that would be caused by blunt trauma, slashes, bites, splashes of burning liquid, and exposure to certain chemicals.  Trauma can arise as the result of impact from airborne missiles (bricks, bottles, including "petrol bombs", metal bars, pieces of timber, fragments of wood and/or glass, skimmed roofing slates, etc.), from hand-swung threats (baseball bats, clubs, pipes, etc.), and from violent body-to-body contact (kicking, punching, etc.).  Other injuries can occur due to exposure to burning liquids and caustic substances.  Experience has shown that all parts of the body are at risk in the attack and training simulation scenarios described above.  A unique piece of equipment intended to protect the head and neck region from these injuries is the riot helmet with attached face shield.

In the U.S., practitioners and the equipment manufacturing industry sometimes rely on NIJ Standardñ0104.02, Riot Helmets and Face Shields, but that standard was last revised in October 1984.  There are no commercial alternatives, and a review of the standard by OLES has led to a determination that it should be updated to reflect current understanding bodily injury mechanisms and injury thresholds.  Additionally, improvements to existing performance criteria described in the standard, and the addition of new ones, are warranted based on a number of expressed needs from practitioners.

By contracting for this research and draft performance standard, the Government will benefit by being able to obtain this information in a timely manner, resulting from the dedicated effort by the contractor.

The primary objective of this procurement will be to develop a revised draft of the NIJ Riot Helmet and Face Shield performance standard.  To accomplish this, research is necessary to characterize the threat environment likely to be encountered by law enforcement and corrections officers when riot gear is deemed necessary.  Research is also necessary to identify injury mechanisms and human injury thresholds, which will be used to establish the minimum performance requirements of the protective gear.  Engineering improvement in the test methods and consistency with other standards, where appropriate, is also necessary.  Controlled laboratory tests must be specified to confirm that the protective equipment meets the performance requirements identified, which are expected to include blunt force impacts, retention, flammability, and optical quality.

Additionally, with the more frequent use of communications gear and respiratory protection equipment (to protect against pepper spray and other irritant compounds), the performance tests must anticipate the interaction of the riot helmet and/or face shield with this additional equipment.

Comparative studies of representative commercially available riot helmets is necessary to confirm the applicability of the test methods and to determine that the safety margins incorporated into the performance requirements are appropriate.

All of this information will be used by NIST to make final recommendations to NIJ regarding an improved riot helmet and face shield performance standard.

The deliverables for this procurement will be a report summarizing the research activities and a draft version of the improved Riot Helmet and Face Shield standard in a format consistent with NIJ Standardñ0104.02.  These deliverables will be reviewed and used by the NIST TIC in support of the project requirements. 

HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

Sources that currently possess capability to perform the aforementioned research are encouraged to respond to this notice and provide the following information:

1. Detailed narrative describing the company/organizationís current capabilities that are directly relevant to the aforementioned type of requirements;

2. Description of each similar project completed by your company/organization has completed as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including as much of the following information as possible: (a) dollar amount of the contract; (b) brief description of the technical requirements of that project; (c) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.); (d) indication of how long the project took to complete from start to finish; and (e) name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done;

3. Current socioeconomic status of your company as it relates to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, for which to size standard is $6.5M;

4. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD) located in Oakridge, TE intends to acquire professional scientific services to assist in a collaborative effort being initiated between the ATDD and the Department of Defense to investigate data and remote sensing requirements for predicting atmospheric transport and dispersion for chem/bio threat mitigation in coastal and littoral regions.  The work includes numerical model development and testing against a very comprehensive near-coastal atmospheric transport and dispersion data set.  Predicting wind fields, atmospheric turbulence, and the resulting dispersion of hazardous materials such as chemical or biological warfare agents is a difficult problem.  It becomes more complicated when the region of interest is physically complex, such as in mountainous regions or along coastlines, where local flows may strongly influence the results.  The situation is even more problematic when local meteorological data are sparse and/or unavailable to the forecaster.  The work will rely heavily on data collected during the mid-1990s under a United States Air Force (USAF)-funded program called Model Validation Program (MVP), a multi-organization, multi-year, multi-season atmospheric transport and dispersion study conducted at the USAF rocket launch facilities at Cape Canaveral FL and Vandenberg CA.  

The DOC/NOAA/ATDD presently anticipates awarding a one to two-year fixed price contract to Kamada Science & Design (KSD), (in accordance with authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) Only One Responsible Source) as the only source known to DOC/NOAA/ATDD for this professional service.   KSD is the only known source that possesses the extensive knowledge necessary to perform the duties required for this project.  KSD was the lead, principal designer and the Co-Principal Investigator of the MVP program study conducted in the mid-1990ís.  As referenced herein, the work to be performed under this requirement will depend heavily on the data collected during that study.  In addition, KSD is an expert on sea breeze behavior in coastal zones (which is a critical issue for atmospheric transport and dispersion in such regions) and has developed specialized parameterizations for use in mesoscale numerical models to better describe atmospheric turbulence in such flows.   One of the goals of this project is to test this modeling approach using the MVP data set to see if improved atmospheric transport and dispersion predictions can be made in coastal regions.  Therefore, DOC/NOAA/ATDD considers KSD to be the only known source possessing the knowledge necessary to perform the services identified herein.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no responsive, affirmative, responses are received, the Government plans to proceed to negotiate and award a contract to Kamada Science & Design.
  
Interested firms capable of providing the services described herein are invited to submit a written response to this request no later than 12:00 Noon CDST, July 28, 2006.  Responses may be sent electronically in Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat format to jane.a.allen@noaa.gov and/or in hardcopy to Jane A.

It is anticipated that the DRFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the Industry Day.

It is the intent of SMC/AXK to establish SAS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Space and Missiles Systems Center Acquisition Support by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Engineering Services (PES) 871-6 Multiple Award Schedule Contracts (Acquisition and Life Cycle Management). There is no closing date for this announcement. The NAICS Code for this action is 541710, paragraph 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. All SAS Delivery Orders will be 100% set-aside for small business participation only. SMC/AXK allows contractors to form teaming relationships for this effort. In order to receive a SAS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA FSS 871-6, PES FSS.  In order to be a qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA PES 871-6 Schedule.  The SAS requirement is for the acquisition of Acquisition Planning, manpower, Manpower, Personnel, Training and Administration, Configuration and Data Management, and Contracting Support.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be through 30 Sep 2011.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders. To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA.  In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the government.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award. Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance. The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded.

<SUBJECT>A -- Advanced Aircraft Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) Threat Warning, Identification, Countermeasures and Targeting
<DESC>The Electro-Optical Sensor Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is pursuing the development of technology supporting the concept of Proactive Infrared Countermeasures (PIRCM) for aircraft self protection.  This concept adds active detection of seeker and sensor threats to the classic reactive laser based IRCM capability to provide a layered, multifaceted approach. The desired PIRCM system should locate and countermeasure electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors that are tracking our aircraft. It should also proactively deny the launch of missiles via countermeasure of the missile seeker in the tube or on the rail. Lastly, the PIRCM system should provide target handoff information of EO/IR seekers and sensors at ranges compatible with existing combat missions. The PIRCM system should support the technical goals and projected cost/sustainability requirements of a near-term capability.  The PIRCM system should support the insertion of advanced technologies into a long-term IRCM system development program. The government will host a meeting for potential PIRCM system developers at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, on 12 Jul 06 at which time AFRL/SNJW will provide additional technical and program information. Feedback from system developers will be used to assess the feasibility of proceeding with a future procurement activity.  The proposed PIRCM system must feature a lightweight modular design that will be flight demonstrated in a pod. The PIRCM system should have the capability to be integrated with different types of aircraft. The envisioned PIRCM system should increase the survivability of multiple fixed-wing and/or rotorcraft aircraft operating at low altitudes in both day and night conditions. Contractors who are interested in this RFI should be prepared to write a white paper describing their PIRCM concept and addressing system-level requirements provided at the informational meeting. The white paper should be submitted to SNJW within thirty days following the informational meeting with the government. Respondents should provide sufficient detail to substantiate their ability to meet anticipated cost, schedule and performance objectives. AFRL is interested in a near-term flight demonstration of a system in near final form, namely Technology Readiness Level 7, within five years. Attendees should be experienced in the design, development, fabrication, test and integration of complex infrared optical systems onto aircraft. It is the desire of AFRL to consider technologies that offer the required capabilities with minimal impact to the integration and installation of the equipment in multi-role combat aircraft and rotorcraft. Interest in an advantageous product will be followed by subsequent inquiries to the contributor. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. AFRL and the Air Force will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, especially near-to-mid term laboratory investment planning. It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet Air Force needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. Questions concerning this announcement should be referred to the Air Force Technical POC. An informational meeting will be held at AFRL/SNZ, Eagle Conference Room, Building 620, Area B, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH on 12 Jul 06, 0830 1200. The government will make planning information available and respond to technical questions during the meeting or by appointment in the afternoon. AFRL/SNJWís on-site contractor will support this meeting and follow-on activities.  Those system developers who are interested in this RFI must submit a visit request and security clearance to the Security POC identified below. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED. However, the presentation and discussion at the informational meeting will be CLASSIFIED up to the SECRET level. Participation by foreign nationals may be restricted and will be determined on a case by case basis. It is not the intent of the Air Force or AFRL to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. Technical POC info: Mr. John F.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice.  Solicitation Number is 6TS-06-JAS-0003.  This is a Solicitation Notice, the Request for Proposals (RFP) documents will be posted on FBO on or about June 12, 2006.  This procurement is for the NEC Telecommunications Switch Maintenance and Follow-On Services for Government-owned NEC switching systems located in the Region 6 Area. (Kansas City; St. Louis; Wichita and Topeka, KS; Springfield, MO; and Lincoln, NE). Vendor must bid all areas to be considered for award. GSA may also order equipment, services, new PBX systems and/or maintenance of additional systems, located within this geographic boundary.  The Government may also utilize this contract as a source of supply for the purchase, installation, maintenance and miscellaneous services for NEC proprietary instruments, key system equipment, and ancillary devices and cabling and wiring.  The Government has determined that ONLY NEC Authorized Distributors can submit offers as prime contractors under this solicitation. All offerors submitting proposals must provide proof of their status as a NEC Authorized Distributor. The proposing contractor will be required to furnish a current letter of good standing or a manufacturerís support commitment letter from NEC.  Brand Name Justification for NEC is as follows:  1. Maintenance Service from NEC Authorized Distributors.  In order to maintain warranties and upper level technical support on the equipment, the manufacturer requires maintenance services be provided by authorized distributors of the equipment.  Upper level technical support, which NEC calls NTAC (NEAX Technical Assistance Center), is support from the highest level technical experts at the manufacturer (NEC).  It is used to investigate, assess and solve problems which are too difficult or systemic to be solved by the local technicians.  If this service is not available some problems could potentially not be correctable, which could cause the system to be inoperable or unable to provide certain needed functions.  The risk of harm to the Government resulting from the loss of warranty protection and inability to provide adequate service to our customers is far greater than any short term financial savings that might be gained from having a non-authorized maintenance provider.  2.  Telephone Sets.  The only options for desk telephone sets that can be used with the NEC PBXs are basic analog, single line sets or D-Term digital sets.  The analog sets do not allow the user to easily access much of the functionality that is built into the PBX.  Some features are not available at all with an analog set, and others are available only by dialing a specific feature code for each feature.  Examples of commonly used features are call pickup, 3-way calling, transferring, call forwarding, speed dialing, call waiting and direct voice mail access.  Our experience has shown that most customers heavily rely on these features.  The proprietary telephone sets manufactured by NEC allow users to easily utilize all of these features by simply pressing a button on the telephone.   3.  NEC Electronic Circuit Cards.  Electronic circuit cards inserted into the PBXs provide the connectivity and functionality of the equipment.  These cards are only manufactured by NEC; there are no alternative manufacturers.  NEC sells these cards only to registered owners or authorized distributors of the specific product. (End of NEC Brand Name Justification).

This procurement will be full and open competition restricted to NEC authorized distributors with OEM Certifications.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The term of the contract will be a base period of one (1) year with four (4) one-year options.  The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract will be $7,000,000 over the 5 year life.  The minimum guaranteed amount will be $50,000 for the base year and $50,000 for each option year, if exercised. Proposals will be due 3:00pm, CST, July 13, 2006.  Send inquiries and questions to Jackie Simington via email at Jackie.simington@gsa.gov and Todd.Tekesky@gsa.gov (alternate) or by Fax to (816) 823-3322.  A pre-proposal meeting will be held in Kansas City, MO on Tuesday, June 27, 2006 at 10:00 a.m.   Please e-mail to address on the form Form A-1 which is included in RFP, Part A, to Rick Reynolds or fax to 816-926-6332 to reserve a spot.   Site tour of locations in Kansas City will be conducted following the Pre-proposal conference on June 27, 2006 at 10:00am (CST).   This procurement is full and open, and not set aside under FAR Part 19.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate answers to questions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation.

1. Is this project part of activities that are already underway, or is this an activity that is being planned and executed from the date of award? 
CDC/DTBE HAS BEEN WORKING IN RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON TB CONTROL FOR EIGHT YEARS. THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED, PROTOCOLS APPROVED AND NEARLY ALL OF THE REQUIRED LOCAL AND FEDERAL PERMISSIONS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED TO DATE. THESE ARE NEW PROJECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF A LONG-TERM PROGRAM AND PORTFOLIO OF ACTIVITIES.
2. It seems as though CDC may already have a protocol for this study. If so, is it an accurate assessment of this procurement that it can be completed within six months since it appears that data collection does not start until approximately Month 3? If not, is CDC considering follow-on work to allow completion of the project?
YES, PROTOCOL EXISTS.
PROJECT WILL NOT BE COMPLETED IN SIX MONTHS. FOLLOW-ON WORK IS PLANNED. 
3. We have 2 physician staff, each of whom meet 6 of the 7 vendor qualifications, and collectively meet all 7 qualifications,--one speaks Russian but is not fluent but is an EIS graduate (retired CAPT, USPHS), and the other is a native Russian speaker (Russian-trained, green-carded Armenian ID physician/ID specialist). Will CDC consider a combination of staff for this project that together meet the qualifications?
CDC WILL CONSIDER RELAXING THE REQUIREMENTS TO SIX OF THE SEVEN MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS FOR CANDIDATES THAT ARE OTHERWISE HIGHLY SUITABLE. CDC WOULD CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF STAFF WHO, WORKING TOGETHER, WOULD MEET ALL QUALIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, SINCE THE SOW WAS WRITTEN FOR ONE, IN THIS CASE, EITHER (1) TWO PERSONS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO JOB SHARE MEANING THEY WOULD WORK 50% AND EARN 50%, OR (2) THE SOW AND BUDGET WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPANDED TO REALISTICALLY REFLECT THE CAPACITY OF TWO PEOPLE.
4. In order to proceed with data collection, will the contractor need to obtain permission from the local (city), oblast, or federal level, or from all 3 levels? Are officials from these levels aware of and anticipating this project and that requests for such permission will be forthcoming? 
EIGHTOFFICIAL PERMISSIONS AND AUTHORIZATIONS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM FOUR OBLASTS, THREE FEDERAL SUPERVISORY TB RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND ONE INSTTUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (WITH  JURISDICTION OVER ALL SITES). TWO MORE AUTHORIZATIONS ARE NEEDED AND SHOULD BE OBTAINED THIS WEEK (BY 16 JUNE 2006). PROJECT AND AWARD ARE CONTINGENT ON THESE TWO FINAL AUTHORIZATIONS.
 
5. Does CDC have existing relationships within the local infrastructures that the contractor will be working with? That is to say, are the locals in these two oblasts/raions/cities expecting this activity and have a structure into which it can be accommodated? 
YES.
6. Who will be responsible for transfer of specimens from Russia to CDC? How will this be implemented? Will specimen transfer from this setting be readily achieved? Has it been done before recently, and if so, can the contacts who achieved it be identified for the contractor? 
ACTUAL SHIPMENT WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY "WORLD COURIER," A SHIPPING AGENT SPECIALIZING IN POTENTIALLY BIOHAZARDOUS. THEY HAVE A LONG-STANDING WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CDC AND WITH THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR LOCAL LAB. WORLD COURIER WILL PICK-UP AT THE LOCAL LAB, VERIFY PACKING AND LABELLING ARE CORRECT, MANAGE ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION AND CUSTOMS PROCEDURES, AND DELIVER TO CDC LAB WITHIN 96 HOURS. ONE OF THE TWO PENDING AUTHORTIZATIONS MENTIONED IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION NUMBER FOUR ABOVE IS PRECISELY FOR PERMISSION TO EXPORT THESE SPECIMENS. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHIPPED MYCO BACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS CULTURES FROM RF TO CDC IN 1999, 2000, 2002, AND 2003.
 
7. When is award expected? If it will be during the summer, has the program considered the issues of relative unavailability of Russian counterparts during the summer months? 
TRAINING OF THE INCUMBENT CAN BEGIN MID-AUGUST. WORK IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER FOR THE REASON STATED.
8. This procurement is listed as being procured under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Does it have a ceiling of $100,000?  
YES, IT HAS A CEILING OF $100,000.
