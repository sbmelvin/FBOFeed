<DESC>The Headquarters Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (HQ AFISRA), Directorate of Communications has a requirement for IT Security Risk Management services. The Government requires essential information technology, information assurance, and engineering services required to manage risk and maintain information resource protections to support current mission. Principal goals of Risk Management Framework (RMF) are to protect the element's ability to perform its mission, not just its information assets; improve information security; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; ensure standards and guidelines employ protections; focus on a more holistic and strategic risk management process designed to develop trust across the IC information technology enterprise through the use of common standards and reciprocally accepted assessment and authorization decisions. The RMF steps require the categorization of the information system; the selection of security controls based on the system categorization; the implementation of security controls; the assessment of the security controls to ensure they're working as intended; the authorization of the Information System; and the monitoring of security controls. Networks that may be affected are the AF Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as other SCI and AF ISR environments. Requirement is anticipated for a two year bridging action until a larger advisory and assistance contract can be awarded. Requirement is anticipated to begin late September 2013. Acquisition strategy is to award an IDIQ type vehicle to meet the Government needs during the two year bridging period. Government anticipates issuing a request for proposal around June 2013. IT personnel support must meet the minimum requirements as identified in PWS and DoD 8570.1M "Information Assurance Training, Certification and Workforce Management". Contractor shall have and maintain a final US Government issued Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) security clearance with a current National Agency Check (NAC). The contractor shall follow the security requirements outlined in the contract DD Form 254, Department of Defense Security Classification Specifications." The contractor shall be subject to random drug testing. Documents shall be maintained and protected as required by the classification of the information. The contractor shall safeguard Government information as required by Enclosure 3 of DODI 8582.01," Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems."

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The 25 AF/A6&nbsp;Directorate of Communications has a requirement for Cybersecurity Risk&nbsp;Management Framework services. The Government requires essential information technology, information assurance, and engineering services required to manage risk and maintain information resource protections to support current mission. Principal goals of Risk Management Framework (RMF) are to protect the element's ability to perform its mission, not just its information assets; improve information security; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; ensure standards and guidelines employ protections; focus on a more holistic and strategic risk management process designed to develop trust across the IC information technology enterprise through the use of common standards and reciprocally accepted assessment and authorization decisions. The RMF steps require the categorization of the information system; the selection of security controls based on the system categorization; the implementation of security controls; the assessment of the security controls to ensure they're working as intended; the authorization of the Information System; and the monitoring of security controls. Networks that may be affected are the AF Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as other SCI and AF ISR environments. Requirement is anticipated for a Firm Fixed Price three year (1 year base period, and 2 option years) contract action.&nbsp;Requirement is anticipated to begin April 2015. Acquisition strategy is to award an 8(a) IDIQ type vehicle to meet the Government needs. Government anticipates issuing a request for proposal&nbsp;by Jan 2015.&nbsp; Contractor shall have and maintain a final US Government issued Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) security clearance with a current National Agency Check (NAC). The contractor shall follow the security requirements outlined in the contract DD Form 254, Department of Defense Security Classification Specifications." The contractor shall be subject to random drug testing. Documents shall be maintained and protected as required by the classification of the information. The contractor shall safeguard Government information as required by Enclosure 3 of DODI 8582.01," Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems."
