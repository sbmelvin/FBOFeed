<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has a requirement for the purchase of a MALDI TOF TOF Mass Spectrometer .  The instrument will provide the NIEHS Mass Spectrometry Workgroup/Protein Microcharacterization Resource program with the capability of carrying out tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometric sequence characterization of peptides to large polypeptides as obtained, for example, from tryptic digests of 1- and 2-D gel separated proteins in a high throughput format.  The instrument must incorporate state-of-the-art ionization, ion optics and detection, including delayed ion extraction and linear and reflectron capabilities.  The instrument must be capable of obtaining MS and true MS/MS spectra from low attomoles of sample and of providing high resolution MS/MS fragment ion data across the complete MS/MS spectrum.  The collision energy of the MS/MS experiments must be variable from low to high energies.  The instrument must be capable of isolation of the precursor ion from adjacent ( m>3 Da at m/z 1000 ) ions in MS/MS experiments.  The system must include a MALDI target autoloader capable of unattended operation.  The autoloader must be compatible with multiple plate formats including high-density arrays of robotically applied spots, membranes or disposable inserts.  The autoloader should be compatible with current Voyager De STR sample plates.  The autoloader should include a scanner to read and select bar-coded sample plates from the cassette to insert in the main vacuum chamber.  The scanned code should then be checked against the experiment to be run on that sample plate.   The acquisition and data analysis software must include a locally installed copy of the Mascot Search Engine and an integrated Oracle database.  It must have the ability to: submit MS data only, MS data and then MS/MS data, and both MS data and MS/MS data together for automated database search; batch queue to submit multiple sample sets for data base searching; support complete ICAT report information for differential expression including ratios, standard deviation, peptide masses, modifications, and heavy and light labels; define levels of user privileges for full or partial data access; and to examine the detailed results of a specific sample location on the MALDI plate via a Protein Peptide Table that lists all of the proteins found in the sample and Spectrum View that is updated with the corresponding information associated with a selected sample location on the target.  Data submitted by the offeror will be used to evaluate the proposed instrumentation as follows:   The system will be evaluated on the basis of sensitivity in the MS/MS mode as defined as a combination of the signal-to-noise ratio of the largest fragment ion in the MS/MS spectrum of a peptide of mass ca. 1500 Da such as glu1-fibrinopeptide B obtained at sample levels of 100 fmol and 1 pmol.  Evaluation of instrument resolution in the MS/MS mode will be based on the entire mass range of fragment ions from a ca. 1500 Da peptide.  True MS/MS capabilities will be determined based on the mass window passed during precursor ion selection and the relative loss of the precursor signal during the selection process.  Collision ion energies will be demonstrated by observation of MS/MS spectra from higher mass peptides or smaller protein (4000 Da or greater).   This is a firm, fixed-price requirement and will be issued under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.   Delivery shall be expected within 120 days of award of the contract.  The requirement may not be awarded until the next Government fiscal year in October 2002.  Submit request for solicitation in writing to the above address or FAX the request to (919) 541-5117.  All requests must include the Solicitation number and marked to the attention of Mary W. McConnell.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation will be available on or about August 5, 2002.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.!!

If you do not pre-register by the cutoff date and time, you will not be allowed to attend.  Further, the registration requests will be honored in the order of receipt up to the seating limitation. This requirement was previously synopsized 17 June 2002 under Solicitation Numbers CWC Treaty SS, CWC Treaty SS V, CWC Treaty SS X, and CWC Treaty SS L as a Sources Sought Notice.   A draft Request for Proposal will be released on or about 2 October 2002 and will be posted on FedBizOps.  The Request for Proposal will be released on or about 23 October 2002 and will also be posted on FedBizOps. A description of the requirement follows: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources capable of providing treaty escort/ transportation services and housing support for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) international inspectors and their U.S. Government escorts during their extended stays for treaty inspections at eight chemical agent disposal facility (CDF) locations within the continental U.S.  The treaty escort/ transportation services primarily include the furnishing of full-time qualified arms control treaty escorts, drivers and vehicle(s). To be qualified escorts and drivers, contractor personnel must possess a SECRET security clearance, pass  an occupational health exam, submit to blood and urine tests, and complete US Government chemical weapons demilitarization, treaty orientation and safety courses, in addition to possessing valid state licenses.  Vehicles consist of a van and possibly up t o 5 additional vehicles at each of the eight CDF locations. The housing support primarily includes providing approximately 8 to 19 hotel-like lodging rooms in a low crime area that is within commuting distance of each of the eight CDF locations and near appropriate amenities and conveniences (restaurants, laundry &  dry cleaning services, etc.).   It also includes office space near the rooms for the lodging driver.  The rooms are for lodging a continual succession of treaty inspectors and escorts, each staying approximately 3-6 weeks. Inherent in performing these services, the contractor would conduct program management consisting of planning, establishing, managing and monitoring the transportation services and the housing support at eight CDF locations throughout the performance perio ds, to ens ure quality support.  The CDF Locations, Projected Start, and Projected End are as follows: Tooele, UT: Ongoing -- Mar 2008;Anniston, AL: Sep 2002 -- Sep 2011; Umatilla, OR:	Feb 2003 -- Apr 2011; Pine Bluff, AR: Apr 2004 --Apr 2011; Newport, IN: Jul 2003 - - Dec 2004; Aberdeen, MD: Mar 2003 -- Sep 2004; Pueblo, CO: Oct 2008 -- NLT Apr 2012; and Blue Grass, KY: Oct 2009 -- NLT Apr 2012. Prior to initiation, the start dates are subject to frequent and often substantial changes.  Likewise, the end dates are sub ject to change based on the progress made in destroying chemical weapons at each location.  Normally, these changes have been slippage into the future.  DTRA's intent is to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with an ordering period of approximately ten (10) years.  The orders will be placed either on a firm fixed price, cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee, or time and mate rial basis.  The total contract value is estimated to be $55 million.  The estimated total cost for the escort services is $24 million and for the housing is $27 million.

<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) will host an Acquisition Strategy Panel meeting for the On-Site (OS) Inspection Directorate Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on Wednesday, 21 August 2002 from 10:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M. (EST) at Fort Belvoir, Virgin ia.   The purpose of this meeting is to provide senior level managers of OS and Acquisition and Logistics Directorate (AL) an opportunity to discuss the acquisition strategy to best meet the customer and agency's needs.   This is a unique opportunity for i ndustry to attend a DTRA Acquisition Strategy Panel. The purpose is to allow Industry an opportunity to observe how the DTRA decides on its acquisition approach. The discussion will center on key issues that will determine the nature of the resulting Request for Proposal and the decision process.   Pre-Registration is required.  Please contact Crystal Hunter by email, crystal.hunter@dtra.mil or by phone, 703-767-7880, NOT LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. (EST) on Friday, 16 August 2002 to pre-register to attend.  The following information must be provided in you r email request to pre-register: attendees full name (Last, First, Middle Initial); official title; citizenship; date of birth; Social Security number; full company name; full company address; phone number; fax number; email address; and identify whether t he company's participation in this competitive requirement is intended to be in the capacity of a prime or as a subcontractor.  If you require further information, please contact Edward Hale at (703) 767-7943, or edward.hale@dtra.mil. Seating is limited, o nly one representative per offeror may request a seat.  If you do not pre-register by the cutoff date and time, you will not be allowed to attend.  Further, the registration requests will be honored in the order of receipt up to the seating limitation. This requirement was previously synopsized 17 June 2002 under Solicitation Numbers CWC Treaty SS, CWC Treaty SS V, CWC Treaty SS X, and CWC Treaty SS L as a Sources Sought Notice.   A draft Request for Proposal will be released on or about 2 October 2002 and will be posted on FedBizOps.  The Request for Proposal will be released on or about 23 October 2002 and will also be posted on FedBizOps. A description of the requirement follows: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources capable of providing treaty escort/ transportation services and housing support for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) international inspectors and their U.S. Government escorts during their extended stays for treaty inspections at eight chemical agent disposal facility (CDF) locations within the continental U.S.  The treaty escort/ transportation services primarily include the furnishing of full-time qualified arms control treaty escorts, drivers and vehicle(s). To be qualified escorts and drivers, contractor personnel must possess a SECRET security clearance, pass  an occupational health exam, submit to blood and urine tests, and complete US Government chemical weapons demilitarization, treaty orientation and safety courses, in addition to possessing valid state licenses.  Vehicles consist of a van and possibly up t o 5 additional vehicles at each of the eight CDF locations. The housing support primarily includes providing approximately 8 to 19 hotel-like lodging rooms in a low crime area that is within commuting distance of each of the eight CDF locations and near appropriate amenities and conveniences (restaurants, laundry &  dry cleaning services, etc.).   It also includes office space near the rooms for the lodging driver.  The rooms are for lodging a continual succession of treaty inspectors and escorts, each staying approximately 3-6 weeks. Inherent in performing these services, the contractor would conduct program management consisting of planning, establishing, managing and monitoring the transportation services and the housing support at eight CDF locations throughout the performance perio ds, to ens ure quality support.  The CDF Locations, Projected Start, and Projected End are as follows: Tooele, UT: Ongoing -- Mar 2008;Anniston, AL: Sep 2002 -- Sep 2011; Umatilla, OR:	Feb 2003 -- Apr 2011; Pine Bluff, AR: Apr 2004 --Apr 2011; Newport, IN: Jul 2003 - - Dec 2004; Aberdeen, MD: Mar 2003 -- Sep 2004; Pueblo, CO: Oct 2008 -- NLT Apr 2012; and Blue Grass, KY: Oct 2009 -- NLT Apr 2012. Prior to initiation, the start dates are subject to frequent and often substantial changes.  Likewise, the end dates are sub ject to change based on the progress made in destroying chemical weapons at each location.  Normally, these changes have been slippage into the future.  DTRA's intent is to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with an ordering period of approximately ten (10) years.  The orders will be placed either on a firm fixed price, cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee, or time and mate rial basis.  The total contract value is estimated to be $55 million.  The estimated total cost for the escort services is $24 million and for the housing is $27 million.

<CONTACT>Verdetta Weaver, (732) 427-1351
<DESC>NA Massively Deployable Unattended Ground Sensors.   The US Army, CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) announces the expectation of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to develop and demonstrate compact unattended ground sensor (UGS) nodes for the detection, classification, location, a nd counting of ground and air targets.  Developed hardware will serve as proof-of-principle units for nodes capable of eventual mass deployment via remote delivery options.  The prototype massively deployable, unattended ground sensor (MDUGS) nodes will be  packaged in representative form factors consistent with the family of scatterable mines (FASCAM) delivery methods (e.g. 120mm diameter).  Developed units will not be hardened for actual remote delivery however risk areas for eventual shock hardening of no des will be identified and assessed as part of the effort.  Node packaging must permit experimentation under typical field environments (i.e. solar loading, rain, snow, etc.).  Performance goals, under favorable conditions, include high probability (greate r than 95%) detection of single heavy ground vehicle targets at ranges out to 600 meters with low probability (less than 4%) of false alarm.  Similar performance probabilities are desired for target classification at ranges out to 400 meters.  Nodes must b e capable of absolute self-location to within 25 meters.  Designs will achieve all performance objectives while seeking to minimize node size (i.e. height), weight, power, and most importantly cost. The MDUGS developed under this effort supports Army UGS objectives being pursued by the NVESD Networked Sensors for the Objective Force (NSfOF) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) and the TACOM-ARDEC Advanced Acoustic/Seismic Systems Science and Techno logy Objective.  MDUGS prototype nodes will be demonstrated as part of the NSfOF ATD and therefore must be compatible with the cluster-based ATD UGS system architecture.  Each UGS cluster will be comprised of sensor nodes with varying sensing, processing, and communication capabilities.  Clusters will include at least one gateway node to provide connectivity between the cluster and the UGS system command and control station.  Experimentation will be conducted to determine optimum sensor mixes, within a clus ter, to perform particular tactical reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeting missions.  In addition to MDUGS, two other classes of sensor nodes are currently under development to provide high fidelity target tracking and identification (via imaging).  D evelopment of the networked communications hardware and protocols, gateway nodes, and control station is also underway and occurring in parallel.  MDUGS nodes developed under this effort must incorporate NSfOF ATD developed in-field radio hardware and asso ciated protocols (networking and messaging).  All NSfOF developed radio hardware (and sensor nodes) utilizes the RS-232 protocol to reduce integration risk and ease integration of emerging technologies. A two-phased approach is anticipated with the possibility of multiple awards during each phase.  Phase 1 will pursue system trade studies to refine and optimize promising concepts.  Those Phase 1 vendor(s) downselected to enter into Phase 2 will fabricate,  demonstrate, and support delivered MDUGS nodes.  In order to meet demonstration objectives of the NSfOF ATD, approximately 100 MDUGS nodes will be developed to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of six by the end of 1QFY05.  Offerors are encouraged to ref erence Government Accounting Office report GAO/NSIAD-99-162 entitled: Best Practices, for a discussion of TRLs. The release of this BAA, Solicitation No. DAAB07-02-R-L724, is anticipated on or about 16 September 2002 with an estimated closing date of 15 October 2002.  A Pre-Bid Conference is also anticipated to occur on or about 24 September 2002 at the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Ft. Belvoir, VA.  All interested parties wishing t o do business with CECOM are invited to access, operate, send and receive data from Army Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP) which can be accessed at the following internet address: (https://abop.monmouth.army.mil).   This notice is not a request for bids or proposals.  It is intended to advise industry of the planned acquisition activity. Technical questions concerning this announcement may be directed to the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Technical Contact: Mr. Daniel Bryski, (703) 704-3285, Daniel.bryski@nvl.army.mil before formal submission of proposals.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) wishes to announce a Planning, Environment, Transportation and Real Estate conference to brief interested parties on their Right of Way/Real Estate Services, Planning and Environment Training Program. This current program will be supported by a five year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, task order contract to be awarded later this year. We are seeking to encourage contractors to participate in our upcoming solicitation by offering them the opportunity to first learn of the program details, ask questions of our panel of experts, and offer industry the opportunity to provide suggestions in the crafting of the solicitation and resulting contract. When issued, the solicitation number will be DTFH61-02-R-00043.

The contract will provide for task orders to be competitively awarded for the development, revision, promotion and presentation of training courses nationwide. The performance of these task orders may require some research for the development of the specific training course, and other related support services as may be required for the success of the program.

As a general guide, task orders may be issued to require:

	An assessment of training needs at the manager, engineering and technical levels.

        Development, revision, and/or updating of selected training courses using curriculum developers specializing in adult education and appropriate subject matter experts.

        Delivery of courses through qualified, experienced subject matter experts in a conference, classroom or distance-learning environment.

        Organize, facilitate and document technical panels and conferences. Develop conclusions and recommendations from participant comments.

	Develop marketing plans that appeal to the target audience.

This conference will be concurrent with the 81st  Annual Transportation Research Board (TRB) Meeting (information link below). There will be two identical sessions at the Washington Hilton Hotel, 1919 Connecticut Avenue, Washington, DC (http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DCAWHHH), on January 15, 2002, in the Exhibit Hall, Concourse level. The morning session will be from 10 am to 11:30 am, and the afternoon session from 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm. Interested prospective contractors may attend either session. Preregistration is not required. For those choosing to ride the Metro, the Woodley Park station is the closest.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to establish multiple, 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development, revision, updating and presentation nationwide of training courses in the areas of Transportation Planning, Environment and Real Estate. These training courses may be for any of the following six FWHA program offices:
?	Metropolitan Transportation Planning 
?	Statewide Planning 
?	Natural Environment 
?	Human Environment 
?	NEPA Facilitation 
?	Real Estate Services

It is imperative that subject matter experts team with instructional systems design specialists to ensure that new course developments-- as well as updates of existing NHI courses-- incorporate adult learning principles. Over the five year performance period, it is likely that new course development and updating activities will require subject matter expertise in a variety of areas, including: environmental streamlining and stewardship, transportation planning, travel modeling, spatial data technologies, historic preservation, air quality, noise abatement, water and ecosystems management, non-motorized transportation, public involvement, historic preservation, Title VI compliance, community programs, Uniform Act, appraisal, acquisition, relocation, eminent domain, etc. 

Typically, course development materials are produced in an electronic format and include lesson plans, an instructor?s guide, participant?s workbook, reference manuals and related items. While most course presentations are instructor-led, distributed learning formats (e.g. CD-ROM, web-based, etc) may be specified.  Instructor-led course presentations require highly qualified, subject matter experts who have experience with deploying adult learning techniques in the classroom or have been certified as NHI Instructors.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Contract Policy Division, at 478-926-2604.  Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  For assistance in interpreting the CBD announcements, please see the CBD Reader' Guide.

<DESC>The requirement is to procure Aircraft Integrated Maintenance Rotor Track and Balance systems (?AIMS systems?), and related supplies and services for the CH-46E Helicopter.  It includes aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering and technical services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.  The main components of the aircraft kit include: AIMS Processor Unit, Acquisition Control Unit, Memory Card, Sensors, Aircraft Installation components and Ground Software.  This product is an adaptation of the existing VXP Balancer/Analyzer previously procured from Chadwick-Helmuth for the CH-46E.   The AIMS monitoring system when installed in the CH-46E aircraft will provide continuous monitoring of rotor track and balance data, vibration levels of all rotating pumps and drive shafts and will provide aircraft crew and maintainers immediate feedback of the aircraft operating condition and engine performance. The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California, which is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System and the only known company with the knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill this need.  Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Maintenance (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer is currently being used for the CH-46.  The AIMS rotor tracker and balance system function will be performed using the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C system.  The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.  note 22.

<DESC>National Imagery and Mapping Agency intends to award a Contract for the procurement of archival support services within the NIMA History Program on a sole source basis to Lisa Wagner for one base year and four 1-year options.  The National Imagery and Mapping Agency proposes this follow-on contract to provide services in archival processing, customary basic preservation procedures, inventorying and entering records metadata to the folder level in the NIMA Voyageur system, assisting in collaborative efforts with NIMA records management and with the National Archives, advising on documents suitable for NIMA displays and exhibits, working with the NIMA historian agency records policy, and history in NIMA.  This assistance is to be provided at NIMA facilities or at such other locations as the NIMA historian deems necessary.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.  Authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B) and FAR 6.302-1.  Firms that recognize that they can perform the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer, and provide supporting evidence to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on any information provided is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responsible sources will be given full consideration.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate, AFRL/PR-West, Edwards AFB, CA is soliciting technical and price proposals for Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology VII (IHPRPT).  These goals are identified in the Announcement to this solicitation.  Responses to this solicitation are sought to develop an advanced technology base for rocket propulsion concepts and components aimed at supporting the IHPRPT program.  The IHPRPT program is the DoD/NASA/Industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  Capability infers the full spectrum of technological needs, such as performance, affordability, operability, reliability, and maintainability.  The IHPRPT program is now structured in four phases to achieve pre-determined measurable increases in all rocket technology capabilities.  Phases I, II, and III specify technology demonstrations for each phase by the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively.  The fourth phase demonstration date, for the Strategic Sustainment Technology efforts is 2004.  The IHPRPT program is organized along three mission application areas: Boost/Orbit Transfer Propulsion, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  Within each of the mission application areas, there are five identical technology areas that specify the particular technologies being advanced to meet the goals of IHPRPT.  The Strategic Sustainment Technology area is a sixth technology area, but exists under the boost/orbit transfer propulsion and the tactical mission application areas only.  A seventh area, entitled Materials, supports the other 6 technology areas.  Proposals are being solicited in the following technology area in this PRDA: DEMONSTRATOR: Hydrocarbon Boost Study. This is an unrestricted solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this acquisition is 541710 with 1000 employees.  Small businesses are encouraged to propose on this solicitation.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA announcement and model contract by accessing the electronic Posting System (EPS) homepage at http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires an Olympus BX61 fully motorized with POS filter turret and associated components from the manufacturer Olympus, Inc. to be furnished and installed at Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Bethesda, MD.  This item will be procured on a brand name or equal basis.  The motorized microscope system will be used for cytogenetic biodosimetry assay validation studies.  The microscope is necessary for rapid capturing of multiple color probe images and to perform MFISH analysis to estimate radiation-induced damage in human blood cells.  This system makes it easy to set up specific optical adjustments associated with a particular observation method, including light levels corresponding to the objective magnification and attachment/detachment of optical components.  Using special control software, it is also simple to macro-program a set of complex procedures such as recording a success of multilabeled specimen images.  Program command is performed by one-touch operation of buttons (there are 8 buttons for focusing, light adjustments and presetting) on the microscope body or hand switch, or via designated computer keys.  Up to 6 fluorescence mirror units can be attached simultaneously.  Mirrors units can be exchanged automatically with corresponding shutter adjustment.  Motorized sextuple revolving nosepiece with slider slot for Nomarski DIC.  Eight position universal condenser.  Different combinations of designated optical components allow correspondence with various kinds of transmitted light observation.  Automatic control of optical component exchange, top lens swing out and aperture iris diaphragm.  Motorized exchange of 6 filters.  3 kinds of filters can be attached simultaneously:  U-FWR for excitation, U-FWO for absorption and U-FWT for transmitted light.  Motorized modules attached to the microscope are controlled via this control box, which is linked to the computer via an RS232C connector.  Two optional board slots are available for auto focus control and digital input/output.  Handset used to control the microscope while conducting visual observations.  The following functions can be controlled from the operator?s hand:  revolving nosepiece operation, control of condenser top lens, shutter for reflected light fluorescence observation, director choice of fluorescence mirror unit, rotation of condenser, and control of aperture iris diaphragm.  
This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6 the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Acquisitions and FAR part 13.5 supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires a Sakura 5214 Tissue-Tek VIP 5 Vacuum Infiltration Processor from the manufacturer Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc. to be furnished and installed at USUHS.  This item will be procured on a brand name or equal basis.  The Tissue-Tek VIP 5 streamlines and speeds the processing of tissue samples.  The tissue processing system allows you to create your own reagent and program names.  The system automatically degasses the paraffin while in the oven, keeping paraffin clean without the need of additional retort cleaning cycles.  The solution manager program reacts to bring processing to completion if a faulty condition occurs.  Programmable water rinse virtually eliminates alcohol fumes in the retort.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Liquid Helium Cooled Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NB814000204125
<RESPDATE>082702

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire a Liquid Helium Cooled Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) from Janis Research Company, Inc., Cryogenic Equipment, Two Jewel Drive, PO Box 696, Wilmington, MA 01877-0696. NIST currently has a research effort to develop a new standard for capacitance calibration based on counting individual electrons.  The goal is to produce a new quantum-based standard for this key electronic quantity.  If successful, this work will allow multiple identical copies of the standard to be distributed and used throughout the world.  At the heart of the new standard are Single Electron Tunneling (SET) devices that manipulate individual electrons.  These nanoscale electronic devices only operate at very low temperatures: below 0.1 K (100 mK).  The operation of these SET devices therefore requires a fairly unique refrigeration system to achieve this very low temperature.  To become a practical quantum standard, the unit must be easy to transport.  This requires a simple, compact, rugged and self-contained (not requiring significant support infrastructure) refrigerator.  The only type of refrigerator that cools below 100mK and meets the above needs is the Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR).  
Approximately 5 years ago, NIST designed a new generation of ADRs to create a transportable refrigerator capable of 50 mK operation.  NIST scientists have built and assembled 5 ADR systems based on this technology, since ADRs were not commercially available.  NIST offered the technology to industry through a licensing process. Only Janis Research Company currently holds a non-exclusive license to the NIST ADR design. The Nanoscale Cryoelectronics Project needs to purchase one ADR systems for the capacitance standard.  Janis Research Company is the only source that meets the following unique requirements: (1) The ADR refrigeration unit must be interchangeable with existing NIST assembled ADR units; (2) The unit must be capable of obtaining a base temperature < 100mK and maintaining this temperature in excess of 36 hours per cooling cycle; (3) The unit must be portable, that is, can be easily boxed and shipped to different locations.  This requires that the ADR be compact and "self-contained", not requiring external dewars, pumps, or other non-portable infrastructure to achieve the required temperatures.  (4)  The unit must have sufficient experimental space to contain the SET capacitance standard experiment:  this requires a minimum cold space large enough to contain a box 15 cm x 15 cm x 20 cm.  This acquisition is for a commercial item for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements. This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: (a) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (b) your organization's experience and (c) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products. (2) a TECHNICAL PROPOSAL indicating proposed methods and procedures to be used in administering the survey; actions to be accomplished to ensure that all completeness and confidentiality requirements are satisfied regarding employee responses; a proposed timeline for satisfying the requirements of this RFQ; an outline of proposed process flow for communications, surveys, responses, analyses, storage and reports; and a sample report demonstrating the application of your organizational skills and abilities to the reporting requirements of this RFQ. (3) a COST PROPOSAL as a separate volume from the Capabilities Statement and the Technical Proposal. It shall provide a complete breakdown of labor categories, rates and anticipated hours, along with an estimate of other costs associated with: collection, storing and analyzing responses; creating, producing and distributing reports; materials; travel; file storage, etc.  Submit an original and four (4) copies of each of the three documents.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMMENDMENT TO A PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT. The class code was incorrectly posted as "T."  The correct class code is "G."  Please read this modified announcement. The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with The United Way of America. (UWA). This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of  the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Children and Families, Office of Community Services.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government has a requirement for research and development activities to expand and augment the existing IDA Program by studying and seeking to remedy existing problems with program implementation, and to aid employer involvement in IDAs. The IDA Program was established by the Assets for Independence Act ("AFIA Act"), under Title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-285, 42 U.S.C. 604 Note), as amended. The legislation authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") -- through its Administration for Children and Families' ("ACF") Office of Community Services ("OCS") -- to conduct a 5-year, $25 million IDA demonstration to establish 40,000 to 50,000 new IDAs across the country. To date, the demonstration project has failed to meet its potential. It is vital for OCS to employ a contractor that will aid OCS in researching and developing ways to overcome obstacles which are currently holding back the growth and development of this important program. Through this contract, it is the goal of the OCS to help facilitate the growth of its IDA program by: (1) creating a cost-effective technology driven universal infrastructure to run an employer-based/work-based IDA program; and (2) studying, researching and creating an employer-based/work-based IDA Demonstration Program.  The importance of enhancing the IDA Program is demonstrated by the strong bi-partisan support it has received by Congress.  There is no doubt that since 1998 support for IDAs has strengthened nationally.  Specifically, the IDA demonstration program received $10 million appropriations in both fiscal years (FY) 1999 and (FY) 2000.  In 1999, $9.4 million was awarded to 40 organizations. In 2000, $4.5 million was awarded to 25 organizations. Congress appropriated $25 million for the IDA demonstration program in its FY 2001 budget resolution.  This was the maximum funding level allowed by law.  The period of performance for this effort is for 24 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by August 23, 2002. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

7) 	operating and maintaining the hardware and software necessary for a comprehensive occupational health data management system consistent with current practices for1) maintaining individual medical records, 
2)	meeting confidentiality requirements, 3) recording and retrieving data related to routine programs (e.g. surveillance) and 4) meeting daily clinic and other operational requirements. The staff required for the OMS are divided into three categories:  key personnel, professional and support.  1)	Key personnel are those individuals having primary responsibility for the overall management and supervision of the OMS daily operations. 2)Professional staff are those individuals for whom specific education, experience and training have qualified them to carry out general or specialized health care functions or activities.  
3)	Support staff are those individuals who carry out the required technical and clerical activities attendant to an occupational medical service.  
The professional, ethical and technical responsibilities and standards necessary to conduct the OMS programs requires the assignment and utilization of only those personnel whose performance will conform to the highest standards and ethics of the health care profession. The operating hours for the OMS are:  Main Unit, Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Auxiliary Unit, Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Routine OMS operations are not conducted on weekend, official Federal holidays, or when the Federal government is otherwise closed.

<DESC>BAA 01-42, ADDENDUM 10, SPECIAL FOCUS AREA: TRAINING SUPERIORITY.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) seeks proposals for innovative research and development of technologies to transform military training by providing continuously-available, on-demand mission-level training for all forces at all echelons.  We propose to do this by creating an environment where there will be a set of continuously available virtual training wars in which any unit or individual can participate via personal computer-based systems that will teach and exercise users in the cognitive aspects of their warfare areas.  INTRODUCTION.  In a 2001 report, Training Superiority and Training Surprise, the Defense Science Board described a U.S. training superiority, developed over the last 35 years, that consists of creating a large-scale mock war within an instrumented range.  Pilots or Army units ?fight? against a dedicated opposing force (OPFOR), attached to the center, who create a better-than-real enemy.  After each engagement the units themselves and the OPFOR generate critical feedback in no-holds-barred after action reviews (AARs). Immediately after a unit completes about two weeks of combat training center (CTC) engagement simulations, it is among the best-trained units in the world.  A few months later, however, skill decay and personnel turbulence has reduced the unit competence dramatically.  Moreover, this kind of training is available to only some of our forces every few years.  In short, there aren?t enough real or training wars to prepare all our forces in all the needed skills all of the time. In this program, we hope to bottle the cognitive learning parts of the CTC experience and export it electronically to all our active and reserve/Guard military forces, and eventually to civilian responders.  If we succeed, our warriors, our staffs, and joint forces will want to and will train continuously in and for all kinds of conflicts, including in areas not well addressed by current training, e.g. mine, electronic, and no-plan come-as-you-are warfare.  A POSSIBLE VISION OF FUTURE TRAINING.  Imagine a future where a strike pilot deployed to a remote airbase or on an aircraft carrier, instead of playing a future computer game, checks into the DARPA-Legacy Continuously Available Training War (DARWARS) with a message ?I want to train.?  His computer recognizes him and notes that he has not read the AAR from the previous session.  While it enforces the reading (perhaps by monitoring the direction of pilot?s gaze) the system looks locally and globally for a mission to train that pilot on the key warfare elements he needs.  The pilot and/or the DARWARS system collects other live participants and fills the gaps with computer-generated avatars.  The pilot and his local team may interact with logistic, air control, service and joint staffs, and ground forces.  An Army forward observer at Fort Hood, who, on his own personal computer, is practicing his tactical Pashto language skills with an avatar of a local ally, might direct the strike aircraft where to drop their bombs. The DARWARS system might detect, from user records, a need for specific soldier training.  For example, it might automatically alter the DARWARS scenario to encourage a pilot to make a mistake that gets him shot down, thus providing a now-virtual injured pilot as a subject upon whom the forward observer can refresh his point-of-wound-care skills.  If the pilot stays where he belongs, the system might shoot the avatar of the foreign ally to provide a suitable wound for the Army forward observer to treat. As each user checks out of DARWARS to perform duties in the real world (or get some sleep), the system, in collaboration with the user, would automatically generate an after action review to be used by the trained users, the warfare area specialists, and the DARWARS system to improve future training.  In addition, the users themselves could write and contribute software to create new training scenarios, or warfare lessons to improve the local or global DARWARS training structure.  THE DARPA TRAINING SUPERIORITY (DARWARS) PROGRAM.  For an annotated viewgraph presentation of the program vision see the DARPA DSO website at http://www.darpa.mil/dso/ under ?Future Areas of Interest.?  The goal of the initial three-year project is to start a paradigm shift in military training by providing a new kind of cognitive training experience for units and individuals based on continuously available wars.  To reach this goal, we will start with a set of local, smaller-scale versions of the future architecture suggested by the vision paragraphs above.  We will then join separate training systems to demonstrate scalability.  The program will embrace two key areas: 1. Create scalable Last-Meter Training Systems (LMTS).  These recognize that it is not enough to deliver training data to a local computer via a network or compact disk; the last meter between the computer and the human must be bridged to create understanding within an ?official intelligence,? the user.  LMTS will train judgment and cognitive performance under stress and provide a 2-sigma improvement (over classroom training) in student, user, and unit performance.  As the program progresses, we hope to combine multiple DARPA LMTS to scale up to massive, multi-user engagements.  LMTS will measure, model, and react to student states.  They might employ, as appropriate to the training task, any of the following: self-generating, non-intrusive user tracking and certification; auto-tutors, games and avatars to provide coaching, training, and performance aiding; ?intelligent? opposing and allied forces as well as neutral (potentially friendly or hostile) participants; self-generating and self-updating of trainable knowledge and content extracted (semi) automatically from user experiences and practice; automated scenario generation tailored to user (individual or unit) training needs; the ability to constitute (in real time) teams and task forces using other players and units encountered in the engagement; and a simulation infrastructure using reusable objects, agents, and standards. LMTS will train meta-cognitive and learning-to-learn skills.  Development of LMTS must be accompanied by the creation of a training toolbox that will allow the training establishment to slash both development costs and the time required to build new training-ware.  Six focus areas have been selected for the initial set of LMTS.  LMTS development proposals in other areas will be considered, but strong justification for the value to DoD of the area, user interest and the potential for contributions from the users must be provided.  Work on an LMT should generate training development tools, advance the DARWARS architecture, and create a useful training system of high military utility.  See the website for more detail on each:    a. Deployable air strike mission trainer; b. Joint Task Force staff warrior; c. Rapid tactical language training for all; d. Combat medical training; e. Dynamic battlefield surveillance planning; f. Information Technology Management aboard ship or at a forward base.  LMTs are not envisioned as high-end, high fidelity trainers.  They are to use readily available computing and display hardware.  Adjunct hardware, such as student/user state sensors must, by the end of several years of development, be low cost and easy to use.  
2. Create a DARWARS Architecture to populate with, and link stand-alone LMT systems.  This will combine real-time generation, maintenance, updating, and modification of the training war scenario.  The architecture should consider the learning and social implications of massive multi-player (MMP) games including their compelling nature, team-forming and team support, and encouragement of contributions by the users to local and global software.  The architecture must be scalable to allow simultaneous training of teams and individuals on all levels (from E-1 to Flag officers).  It must monitor skill progression.  Training value will, however, be the driving factor in any DARWARS architecture.  Ideas of general value to all LMT areas and cross-cutting technology developments that will enable the DARWARS architecture are encouraged with or without teaming.  Cross-cutting technology development might include tutor authoring languages, tutorial dialogue management, automated scenario generators, continuous student-state monitoring capabilities, real-time assembly of simulation objects into meaningful presentations, techniques that identify ace performers early-on, development and assessment of the psychometric properties of simulations, realistic human behavior representation, etc.  Work in these areas may be proposed as separate tasks; however, development of these technologies within the context of one or more LMTS is preferred.  Additional areas of interest for development within either an LMTS and/or the DARWARS architecture include the following: A) Systems that automatically create in real-time and re-use scenarios so that DARWARS can encompass multiple wars, simultaneously track and ensure achievement of local and global training goals, allow rapid (often automated) insertion of new scenarios and technologies, and automatically place the student, users, and units at the right point in the ?training space.?  B) A capability to generate and present automatically (semi-automatically at first) AARs that will provide assessment and feedback to/on all of the following: the learner/user, the training system, and warfare lessons learned.  AAR generation should provide metrics for distinguishing between sound warfare actions and decisions and those that arise from luck or from DARWARS artifacts.  HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN DARWARS.  We encourage submission of white papers that encompass one or more of these program areas.  White papers may include any single areas or any combination of the above areas.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams to develop solutions to the problems posed by the development of DARWARS.  We may ?mix and match? from among the white paper submissions in order to select the best combination of ideas.  Prepare the initial white papers in the following format: I. Cover Sheet (include significant proposer information: Title, organization(s), PI, mailing address, email address, fax and phone numbers).  II. Technical submission, (ideas, technical approach to achieve goals, 12-18 month milestones, 3-year tentative milestones; Be specific; eschew boilerplate text) 2-4 pages.  III. Company resume, 1-page.  IV. Cost estimate, 1-page.  Open architecture and knowledge sharing is critical to the success of this program.  Intellectual property developed under this program will be shared with other participants under a shared intellectual property agreement.  Intellectual property created and owned by a proposer before joining the program will be protected.  White papers received within 30 days of the publication of this Addendum will be evaluated immediately upon receipt.  After review we will request revised white papers or full proposals.  White papers received after the 30-day time period will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Notwithstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will respond to full proposals expeditiously.  Regardless of the recommendation of the white papers, the decision to submit a full proposal is the responsibility of the proposer.  The deadline for proposals is 12 December 2002.  We encourage communications with the Training Superiority/DARWARS Program Manager, Dr. Ralph Chatham, rchatham@darpa.mil, 703-696-7501, during the preparation of white papers and full proposals.  Submit white papers as email attachments sent to dsobaa01-42@darpa.mil.  Word 97 or higher is recommended (Embedded text and .pdf files are acceptable) or by U.S. mail: (DARPA DSO, Attn: Training Superiority -BAA01-42 -Addendum 10, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203).  Facsimile transmissions will not be accepted.  Include the phrase ?Training Superiority? in the title.  Please refer to the original BAA01-42, dated September 4, 2001, for additional information.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to address the following clarification and questions for the specifications provided for this solicitation:  

1) On the data sheet for ROV-4001

	Please clarify note (3). Please clarify the 500psi dp requirement, also clarify the inlet side 1000 psi requirement.  Closing against a full dp of 6000psi is understood.  For the open stroke time, at what pressure is this to be tested?

Response: 1) Clarifications for ROV-4001 - This valve will be used as a main shut-off valve for hydrocarbon fuel service.  It will be located at the outlet of a hydrocarbon fuel tank.   Normally, this valve will be opened and closed at less than 100 psi.  Once opened and the system brought to pressure, the valve must be capable of closing with a full DP of 6000 psi.  When the valve is closed and the tank is pressurized, the valve shall not be capable of being opened with pressure on the inlet side of 1000 or greater psi.    Ignore the DP of 500 psi requirement.  The open stroke time should be tested at 1000 psi.  

2) On the data sheet for ROV-4002

	Please clarify note (3).  A system description would be helpful.  Please clarify the type of position indicator requested for the limit switches, visual vs. 24V signal to a controller.

Response:  2) Clarifications for ROV-4002-- This valve will be used as a fill valve in a hydrocarbon fuel system.  It will normally be opened and closed during filling operations when the system pressure is around 100 psi or less.  Since the valve is connected to the a high pressure run system though, when it is closed the downstream (or outlet) side of the valve will be subjected to pressures of up to 6000 psi.  This drives the requirement that the actuator not be capable of opening the valve when the pressure on the outlet of the valve is 1000 psi or greater.  When the valve is opened, it should be capable of opening against a DP of 150 psi. Limit switches, indicating if the valve is full open or full closed, and as specified under section 3.2.7(2)(A) pg 8 of the specification should be provided--not a controller.  

3)  Regarding ROSS-1005 Specification we have the following questions:

	Page 5, paragraph 24,  Do you prefer the MS ports?
	Page 6, paragraph 5,  Do actuators have to be stainless steel or can they be painted carbon steel?
	Page 8, paragraph 2.  Can solenoids replace the Moog servo valves?
	Page 10 paragraph 3.3.2.  Do you require an acceptance test procedure for approval?
	page 11, top paragraph.  Is the requirement for the 100ft of Belden plenum cable 89418 necessary?  We have not done this test like this in the past but are willing to do this if necessary.

Response:  3)(a)We prefer the MS ports.
	(b)Actuators can be painted carbon steel.
	(c)You should plan to use the solenoid valves.
	(d)We did not specifically request the acceptance test procedure be submitted and approved.   However, if the Contractor would like us to review and approve their test procedure we would be happy to do so.
	(e)The requirement for the 100 ft of Belden plenue cable is necessary.  This is to more closely simulate the length of cable that will actually be connected to the valve in the field, and will therefore more closely simulate actual field conditions during testing.  

No further changes indicated.

<DESC>The reason for this amendment is to address a question raised concerning the actuation specifications.  The question, response and a change in the specifications is identified below:  

Question:

Regarding the actuation, it appears that a direct acting actuator with an overall length dimension of approximately 49" is essential due to size contraints.  This actuator will require an accumulation tank and dump valves, tubing etc.  Will Edwards be taking care of the accumulation tank and assorted valve and tubing or would you prefer the contractor to quote the tank and accessories as well as the actuator.  For complete testing, the tank is necessary.

Response:

	After reevaluating the size and type of actuator, the following changes to the original specification are made:

	1. The overall size of the actuator shall be no longer than 50" and the overall diameter shall be no greater than 25".  The actuator shall be oriented lengthwise along the valve body.

	2. The vendor may substiture a pneumatic actuator in place of the hydraulic actuator specified provided it meets the same functional and operational requirements, and the spatial requirements identified in item 1 above.  The Contracting Officer has up to 1500 psi GN2 available to operate the actuator.  

	3. If  the vendor elects to provide a pneumatic actuator then the vendor shall be responsible to provide a GN2 accumlator as well.  The accumulator shall be pressure rated at least 20% greater than the design actuation pressure.  It shall be sized such that it can open and close the ball valve three complete cycles without recharging.  The accumlator shall be designed, fabricated and stamped in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 1.  The inlet/outlet connection shall be either an MS 33649 straight thread or FNPT.  The connection shall be sized to accommodate the required flow.   The accumlator be lined with either baked on phenolic resin, electrodeless nickel plating or epoxy coating.   All supporting documentation for the acculator required by the ASME code shall be provided.  

	4. The vendor may use the accumulator for shop testing of the valve to verify proper actuation and operation.  After testing the accumlator shall be cleaned to level 300 of MIL-STD-1246C, and the openings shall be plugged or otherwise protected for shipment.  

	5. All interconnecting tubing between the accumulator and valve actuator required for shop testing only shall be furnished by the vendor.  The Contracting Officer shall supply all interconnecting tubing, valves, filters, etc. for permanent field installation of the valve and accumulator.  

No other changes indicated.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), and is not to be construed as any procurement commitment by the Air Force.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer, Contracting Specialist or Program Manager identified above.  Interested parties may call the AAC Ombudsman, Dr. Mario J. Caluda at (850) 882-5558, with serious concerns only.

<DESC>Questions concerning Refuse and Recycling:


1) Would the base consider making a separate CLINS for disposal/tonnage? Yes 

2) Are the 8 yard front load containers on base owned by the base or by Selrico? Selrico 

3) A lot of the cans are in bad shape.  You know, paint is bleached out and bottoms are rotted out or lids are damaged.  Who is responsible for maintaining these units.   Contractor is responsible. 

4) The conveyor is owned by the base.  It is very bad condition.  Who is responsible for maintenance?  Starting 1 Oct, contractor will be owner of conveyor & responsible for maintenance.  In it's current condition, it might be cheaper to lease and/or buy a new one? Contractor's decision. 

5) Why the big drop in the amount of material to be recycled?  Disposal is very high. After many years of paying a contractor to sort 70-80% of our refuse, those materials, which have historically not sold or been re-used have been excluded from sorting, recycling, processing, and marketing; and will go directly to the landfill. 

6) Appendix A for the SOW for Refuse and for Recycling are identical.  Is it intended to have the same containers used for recycling and for refuse? Yes 

7) Is it the intent of the SOW to have the contractor collect sorted recyclables from each office facility?  Yes, from each building or building compound area. If so, what containers are being specified for the task? It is up to the contractor to decide "how, when, & with what" refuse and recyclables will be collected.  Current locations for collection stations on base will accommodate 1 or 2 standard refuse dumpsters. Typically one dumpster has been labeled for "refuse" and one for "recyclables." 

8) In paragraph 1.5.6.2. It states that multi-compartmental containers should be used.  (It is up to the contractor to decide if he will use or not use multi-compartmental containers.)  What size are the containers, when will these containers be collected (the contractor must submit a collection schedule for the contracting officer's approval. The schedule must adequately address volumes of refuse and recyclables to be collected on a weekly basis), how many containers are required (up to the contractor to decide on size of containers which will in turn determine how many containers are needed), and where
will the containers be located? (up to the contractor to determine & obtain contracting officer's approval for location of collection stations.) 
GENERAL RESPONSE to questions above: For non-MFH areas, historically there have been approximately 150 dumpsters, 8 cu yds each placed at approximately 130 locations; collection schedule for 75% of these locations or collection stations have been serviced twice a week; 15% require 3 times per week, and the remaining 10% require weekly pick-up. For MFH areas, historically there have been two containers per MFH resident/unit; neither larger than 85 gallons; one designated for refuse and the other for recyclables. 

9) In regard to the in-vessel composter: Who is responsible for the cost of maintaining the composter? The contractor will perform routine & scheduled maintenance checks. Cost of repairs will be paid by the Government provided the contractor obtained CO approval prior to initiating repairs.   What is done with the compost from the composter?  Contractor transports to Recycling Center for sale and/or re-use. How often is it emptied?  Typically every other day.  Are there scales provided to weigh in-put and out-put?  No. What happens to the food waste if the composter is broken? Contractor requests CO approval to take to landfill while composter is being repaired. 

10) In paragraph 1.10.2.1. It states the contractor shall provide a drum crusher.  In the Appendix with Government Furnished Equipment the Government supplies one drum crusher.  Can this Government provided drum crusher be utilized for this task or is the contractor required to buy an additional drum crusher? The gov-furnished drum crusher will become the property of the contractor on 1 Oct 02; repair, maintenance, and/or replacement will be at contractor's expense as of 1 Oct 02. 

11) In paragraph 1.5.5.4. It states the contractor shall immediately notify the QAP regarding any DRMO items in the container.  How is the contractor to know if these items are in the container and what are DRMO items?  DRMO is required to notify the contractor & will be required to work closely with the Recycling Center to recover any DOD item(s) that must be processed for sale by DRMO. It is DRMO's responsibility to drop by the Center, educate the recycling manager, and collect DRMO items. There is minimal impact to Recycling Center operations, but there is an occasional item that surfaces at the center. 

12) At the site visit it was stated there are no rolloff containers required for this contract.  In paragraph 1.6.1.2. it states the contractor shall furnish tarped roll off containers.  Are there any historicals in regard to this service?  Used for self-help projects & CE operations such as asbestos abatement.  What size containers are needed?  30 and 40 cu yard  How many containers are needed?  Containers are ordered by contractor, but any charges such as delivery fee, emptying fee, etc. is paid directly to BFI Landfill by the government.  Will this service be a separate CLIN item? No. 

Regarding 8 cy frontload government owned dumpsters.
On August 2, 2002 I inspected government dumpsters, after evaluating their condition it is my opinion they need to be replaced or put on a rigorous refurbishing program.

13) Will government replace dumpsters or contractor provided?   Contractor becomes the owner on 1 Oct 02. 

14) Does government have a maintenance schedule?   Up to contractor to maintain. 

15) Recycle compartmentalized trailers, how many? And locations?   See above. 

16) Government provided Hyster forklift is inoperable therefore should be not included on government provided list of equipment?   Becomes contractor property as of 1 Oct 02.  

17) Other than routine maintenance on government owned equipment will repairs (labor) to equipment be line items?  Effective 1 Oct 02, there will no longer be any government-furnished equipment. 

18) Regarding housing it is my understanding that you are phasing in new housing to be completed by 2005 what will the number of household be at that time?  Same. New housing will replace old housing.

<DESC>Modification to the Pre-Solicitation Notice

The Pre-Solicitation Notice for Solicitation Number GS-03P-02-AZC-0015 which previously posted on March 7, 2002 is being replaced with the following synopsis.  NOTE:  The Pre-Solicitation Conference scheduled for April 4, 2002 has been canceled until further notice:

Elevator Modernization and Preventive Maintenance Service at the J. Caleb Boggs Courthouse and Federal Building, 844 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 235950.  The Project No. is RDE02566, and the Solicitation No. is GS-03P-02-AZC-0015.  The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting proposals for the modernization of four (4) passenger elevators and one (1) passenger/service elevator in the J. Caleb Boggs Courthouse and Federal Building, 844 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware.  The elevator modernization project will include, but is not limited to the following:  Modernization of four passenger elevators, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; option for upgrading one passenger elevator No. 5; full preventive maintenance on all six (6) building elevators (including the prisoner elevator which is not being modernized) from the first day of the month following issuance of the notice to proceed, continuing through the installation period and for 12 months following the Government's acceptance of the project; and five 1- year options for preventive maintenance including additional services.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The contract will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm fixed price award to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  This solicitation is being procured on an unrestricted basis.  Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to product source and data, successful past performance, maintenance plan, key personnel qualifications, staffing plan, work schedule, phasing plan, subcontracting plan, participation of SDB firms and price proposals.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award without discussions.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than price.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1.  Product Source and Data,  2.  Past Performance, 3.  Maintenance Plan, 4.  Key Personnel Qualifications and Staffing Plan, 5.  Work Schedule/Phasing Plan/Subcontracting Plan, and 6.  Extent of Participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Concerns.  Copies of this Solicitation (RFP) with drawings will be available on or about April 25, 2002.  However, as a result of recent events that have impacted the safety and security of people and facilities under control of the GSA, security procedures are being enacted to reduce the risk that sensitive unclassified material will be used for dangerous or illegal purposes.  Therefore, only authorized users will be issued a copy of the specification and drawings, and these documents cannot be copied once obtained.  The following procedures must be adhered to by all authorized users.  Offerors (both General Contractors and Subcontractors) who want a copy of the solicitation package must request from Brenda Haywood, Contract Specialist, a copy of ?DOCUMENT SECURITY, NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS.  This document must be completed with 
 a copy of the firm?s business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  This document shall indicate the name, address, phone number of the company, state of corporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter.  A valid DUNS Number and IRS Tax ID Number is also required on the Document Security Form.  The form must be signed and dated to show agreement with the conditions set forth in the document.  Offerors can fax the completed form to Ms. Haywood so she can begin the review process, but the solicitation package cannot be released until the original signed Document Security form is received.  Upon receipt of a correctly completed form, Ms. Haywood will mail, or the offeror can arrange for pick-up, one set of the specifications and drawings in CD format to the prospective offeror.  Upon award of the contract resulting from this soliciation, the unsuccessful offerors must destroy the specifications and drawings.  To be included on the GSA source list, and to obtain copies of the specifications and drawings available on or about April 25, 2002, please mail, fax or email your request for the Document Security form to Brenda Haywood, at GSA, Wilmington Field Office, J. Caleb Boggs Courthouse and Federal Building, 844 King Street, Room G-606, Lock Box 45, Wilmington, DE; fax (302) 573-6660 or Brenda.Haywood@gsa.gov; Please reference Solicitation Number GS-03P-02-AZC-0015 for identification purposes.

<DESC>Solicitation NA1341-02-Q-0622 dated August 6, 2002 and, Amendment 01 dated August 08, 2002 are hereby amended to address the following vendor questions/concerns: Questions:  Do you have a specific vendor/manufacture in mind (ref:expand big fabric brand)? Answer: NIST is looking for a specific brand of exhibit called Expand Big Fabric. Concern: On the large pop-up, a single case will decrease the life of the display and case will be heavy to move around. The halogen lights will be very hot and need 10 to 20 minutes to cool down. If packed in one case they will retain their heat and could cause damage to the graphics. Answer: This exhibit is designed to fit in one case, including the lights.  Lights could be placed in a separate container/box to keep them separated from the other materials.  Graphics are printed directly on to a large piece of fabric, which is attached to the exhibit frame with velcro. Question: What is your definition of High Resolution graphics on fabric panels? Answer: The vendor will be provided with artwork in the appropriate electronic format. The highest resolution possible is desired so the graphics are crisp and clear.  Question: Can Overall Dimensions be a little larger? Answer: Since a specific brand is required the dimensions of the display are determined. Question: The standard size for the Big Fabric displays you are interested in are:  88"x88" and 60"x60", your sizes on the request are 79.5"x88" and 60"x58".  Can we assume that we can take your artwork and make it fit on the standard size?  Answer: NIST can make the artwork fit the standard size. Question: Will you need a proof before we print the graphic? Answer: Yes NIST would like a proof. Question: Do the end users intend to always use this as a total "graphics" display? Given the reason for wanting Velcro as a mounting medium to the Fabric panels. Answer: Yes, NIST looking for a specific brand of exhibit called Expand Big Fabric.  This is a different exhibit system than the traditional pop up exhibit.  With the Expand Big Fabric, graphics are printed directly on to a one 88" x 88" (for the 7.5 ft display) seamless piece of fabric, which is attached to the exhibit frame with velcro. NIST is not looking for a traditional pop up exhibit that uses three or four rollable fabric panels to which graphics could be attached with velcro.  This would not meet the requirements.
Question: What is the reason for wanting to mount the graphics via Velcro if it is to be mainly permanent graphics? Answer: With the Expand Big Fabric, graphics are printed directly on to a one seamless piece of fabric, which is attached to the exhibit frame with velcro. Question: What is the Overall required width of the full height Pop Up Display? There
was a reference to a three panel which in standard terms means a 8 X 8 curved Pop Up System. A 8 x 10 is normally a 4 front panel & 4 back panel plus two end cap system. Answer: The dimensions of the 7.5 ft Expand Big Fabric display are 88"x88".  These display systems are also referred to in "squares."  The 7.5 ft display is 3 squares x 3 squares.  This is a different system than traditional pop up displays.
Question: Cases that are designed for One Case travel are not Suitable for Hardware & the Fabric Panels plus Graphics panels.
Graphics must not be rolled Tighter than 10'' minimum. So solving solution is to put all hardware into a smaller wheeled case. That will then leave the other one to store and ship as per your requirements of Front panels plus End panels. Are the end panels to be graphics or Fabric? Answer: Since there are no rolling graphics panels and the fabric attaches directly to the frame, this exhibit is designed to fit in one case, including the lights.  The fabric stretches around the end of the display to give the appearance of "end caps." Question: Should you choose the later route - you will also be able to turn the larger case into a nice podium for display usage rather than putting cases into storage at a convention or interior use in a building. Answer: Not necessary.  NIST only wants one case. Questions:  Lighting - if the Velcro method is used - you will not be able to Backlight the Graphics via placing Tube lighting inside the straight pop-up. As the fabric panels will block the use of back lighting.  And you will only be able to front light with boom lighting. Halogen lights are known to reach Temperatures of 350F degrees so the lights
will have to be mounted critically in this case with all over graphics
panels. Should they be incorrectly mounted, they are known to burn the laminate protection fused to the graphics surface of the panels and a rapid bubble effect will be apparent. Answer: The lights should attach to the top of the exhibit frame and light the front of the exhibit.  Backlighting is not required. Question: The front luster surfaces of all graphics are designed to roll luster out and are put into special liners to minimize damage to and
in travel to the graphics. The liner is not made to accommodate a fabric panel as well. Remember also with a straight system you have extra panels. Is this being viewed with graphics both sides to be viewed away from a back wall with graphics all round similar to a Tower system? Answer: No.  The graphics show only to people viewing the display from the front.

Statement of Work
C-130E Aircrew Training Device
02 August 2002

1.0 SCOPE
The 314 AW proposes utilizing a desktop part-task, PC-based, networked aircrew training device (ATD) to replicate the C-130E pilot, co-pilot, and navigator flight stations.  This configuration will focus on crew coordination, crew resource management (CRM), situational awareness, night vision goggle (NVG) flying, visual airdrop, visual low-level map reading, time-over-target (TOT) control, threat recognition/avoidance/ maneuvers, Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) procedures, visual formation flight, navigations systems management, NVG operations, Airborne radar approaches (ARA), and tactical formation maneuvers.   This initiative should significantly enhance aircrew readiness by providing a training bridge between classroom/simulator and the aircraft.   The device will also serve as a remedial training device for students experiencing difficulties in certain areas in the aircraft (current course loads all but prohibit remedial training in Weapons System Trainers (WST)).  Furthermore, this solution allows instructors to easily manipulate the training environment in support of diverse training scenarios, thus promoting part-task training, individualized instruction, and team training (e.g., CRM).  The ability for students to familiarize and rehearse selective skill sets, before employing the aircraft, will advance fundamental cognitive skills required to employ the C-130 weapon system.  Additionally, the flight environment simulated by using the virtual reality (VR) goggles very closely replicates the actual limitations of flying with NVGs and will likely provide exceptional training for crew members in developing NVG scanning habit patterns.  

2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 The 314AW is the only active duty unit within the Department of Defense that provides C-130 aircrew training.  The training is provided to aircrew members from the active duty Air Force, National Guard, Reserve, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and several foreign countries.  Unfortunately, students often find the transition from classroom tactical lessons to performance in the actual aircraft a rather broad leap.  The propose desktop simulator presents a means to round out the aircrew training system by providing a hands-on cognitive learning tool which, potentially, leads to improved material retention.

2.2 Historically, aircrew training depended heavily on the weapon systems as the only realistic media for providing mission training.  ATDs were primarily used as an adjunct to prepare crewmembers to more effectively use limited flying hours.  However, increased training requirements coupled with the requirement that aircrew members graduate from the Formal Training Unit (FTU) be mission ready have reduced the quality and quantity of realistic, available training opportunities for aircrews.  The formal school training strategy employs ATDs to accomplish as many training events as practical through simulation.  For events with simulation training capability, simulation precedes on-aircraft training.  Normally, these tasks are taught to the appropriate proficiency level in the least sophisticated ATD.  Training progresses through knowledge, comprehension and performance levels.  As the student advances through the syllabus, related tasks are combined and the student is trained on the next level ATD.  With this methodology, students master procedural tasks before arrival at the aircraft.  Once at the aircraft, students concentrate on developing flying skills.  

2.3 The proposed system is not designed to reduce programmed weapon system trainer or flying hours.  Additional simulator time is not possible due to current student load, and the training requirements levied by 4 training (3 AETC, 1 CADS) and 2 operational C-130 squadrons.  It is intended to enhance the current training construct by reinforcing cognitive skills and providing a realistic simulation for tactical airlift missions.  Savings may be realized in the area of reduced ?break-in-training and additional training flights required by students who may need more time to reach required proficiency levels.  Additionally, TDY costs could be reduced by providing students training during weather and maintenance delay periods, time otherwise lost.  PC-based cognitive training simulation will improve training mission effectiveness by enhancing aircrew situational awareness, formation procedures, NVG procedures, threat recognition/reaction, and coordinated crew response.  Employing the proposed training device will unquestionably lead to improved training efficiency and optimum use of limited resources.

This solicitation was posted incorrectly.  The information in this posting pertains to solicitation F61358-02-R-0012(Repair of Sealine Strainer) and not F61358-02-R-0009(Repair of Gymnasium).  Again, this is the notification of award for the Sealine Strainer Contract (F61358-02-R-0012).

<DESC>17. The Naval Sea Systems Command, SEA 93, Advanced Systems and Technology Office (ASTO), Washington Navy Yard, Washington D.C. together with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Arlington, VA is holding an Industry Day to discuss new and innovative designs and concepts in Submarine Tactical Control Technologies.  The Industry Day will be held September 12, 2002 from 1:00 to 4:00 PM in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area. Attendance will be limited to two (2) representatives per organization.  For detailed registration and attendance information please refer to the link below on the Internet.  Final date to register your organization is August 23, 2002.  The security classification for the event will be unclassified. Background.  The Navy has recently initiated the Advanced Processing Build  Tactical (APB-T) Project, a process/product for infusing advanced Tactical Control T echnology into Submarine Combat Control Subsystems.   An APB-T consists of Tactical Decision Aids that assist the Commanding Officer in achieving control of the tactical situation and making timely tactical decisions.  Some examples of tactical control technology include development of advanced data fusion algorithms, target motion analysis, contact management, tactical scene rendering, sensor performance prediction models, search planning, option reduction, uncertainty management, acoustic and non-acoustic vulnerability management, close encounter decision management, automation, voyage planning, etc. Developmental products will be subjected to a peer review process, where candidate applications will be subjected to a rigorous data driven evaluation, and compared against similar products using objective criteria. As such, candidate products must be made available to the gover nment-designated agency for evaluation purposes.  The mechanisms to provide products for evaluation will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  The preferred form is in a standalone executable form compatible with government supported test beds and data formats with a means to record, interpret, and assess information produced by the application.  APB efforts traditionally address specific areas or components that demonstrate required performance and/or affordability improvement against defined threats in specified environments.  Industry, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, educational institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions are encouraged to participate.  Respondents to the planned ONR solicitation will be required to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work pr oposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance.  The Industry Day will focus on the historical and technical background of the APB-T Project, the production Combat System plans, an overview of the APB process, and a discussion of the likely requirements of the planned ONR solicitation for Advanced Tactical Control Technologies.  You may register to attend the Industry Day at www.asto-nav.com (case sensitive) by clicking on the Calendar button followed by the Submarine Tactical Control Technologies link at September 2002 on the calendar menu.  Please contact Ms. Holly Kichinko at H.Kichinko@StanelyAssociates.com, 202-741-1357 if you are unable to access the ASTO website.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Carderock Division ? Memphis, TN seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Electrical Distribution and Wastewater Collection Systems at Memphis, TN.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Navy will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for NSWC Carderock Division - Memphis and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  Please note if there is no market interest shown during this call of Notice of Interest, it is DESC?s and the Naval Surface Warfare Center?s intent to contact the local provider for possible privatization of the utility system under an ?Other than Competitive Process?. 

OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire electrical distribution and wastewater collection systems and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner(s).  Utility services under the potential contract will not include commodity supply.  Therefore the owner of the distribution network and equipment need not also generate or resell electric power or water to NSWC Carderock Division ? Memphis.  

INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Note:	(1).  All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.
