<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Running and Analysis of SOLAR2000 Solar EUV Irradiances and the E10.7 proxy for the use in the Marshall Engineering Thermosphere (MET) model. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Space Environment Technologies/ Space Wx, 1676 Palisades Dr., Pacific Palisades, CA 90272-2111, pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The required work was originally awarded to Federal Data Corporation (Logicon) on a sole-source basis due to the unique qualifications of the proposed Principal Investigator, Dr. Kent Tobiska.  Dr. Tobiska is the author of SOLAR2000 which produces the EUV irradiances and the E10.7 proxy for the use in the MET model, and his unduplicated expertise and experience was gained through performance of a NASA sponsored proposal submited in response to NRA-00-01-0SS "Living with a Star Program (LWS)".    Subsequent to award and prior to the exercise of any of the options contained within the basic award document, Federal Data Corporation's contract was novated to Northrop-Grumman.  Concurrent to the time of novation, Dr. Tobiska established Space Environment Technologies/SpaceWx.  As Dr. Tobiska was no longer available to perform the required services under the contract held by Northrup-Grumman, a determination was made not to exercise the options contained in the novated contract.  Because the Government still requires the same services covered by the unexercised options, and procurement of these services from a firm other than Space Environment Technologies/Space Wx would require duplication of research, information gathering, writing, and editing that would	result in substantial additional expenditures of finacial and schedule resources,  it was further determined to be in the Government's best interest to proceed with procurement of the remaining required services from Space Environment Technologies/Space Wx.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 18, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All sources determined to be responsible after submission of the required capabilities/qualifications may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Lisa Ferrante, 609-485-5837
<DESC>In 1998, Department of Transportation (DOT) began planning for the implementation of Oracle Federal Financials as the new Departmental accounting system, called Delphi.  The new system replaces an outdated legacy system that no longer meets Federal accounting requirements or the varied financial management needs of DOT's Operating Administrations (OAs).  The success of Delphi is critical to meeting DOT's financial management needs.  Recognizing the importance of financial management to overall government management, the President's Management Agenda includes financial performance (management) among its five major goals for all Federal agencies. <P> While Oracle Federal Financials is Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software, extensive efforts are required to identify, document, and map each OA's accounting processes to the various modules in Oracle Federal Financial, and the flow of data and transactions among those modules.  Other significant elements of the conversion process include developing and testing conversion programs, developing and testing interfaces to and from feeder systems, developing user reports, developing and presenting user training, and managing significant organizational change on a large scale.  The first major phase of this effort was to develop a DOT-wide "Global Build," which forms the basis for each of the OAs to configure and set up their own Set of Books in Oracle Federal Financials. <P> The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) was the first OA to convert to production in early 2000.  Six other small OAs converted to production in the months following FRA, and in December 2001 we successfully upgraded Oracle Federal Financials to release 11i.  This was a major upgrade that required about 6 months of planning and testing.  TSA was set up on Oracle Federal Financials in February 2002, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) converted in June 2002.  After years of planning and testing, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is scheduled to convert to Oracle Federal Financials in November 2002, and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is scheduled to convert in December 2002.  The FAA and FHWA conversions are several orders of magnitude more complex than the earlier conversions of the smaller OAs and represent the most critical elements of the whole Delphi program.  Maritime Administration (MARA! D) and Volpe Transportation Center is scheduled to convert in April/May 2003.  Conversion planning and testing has been underway for FAA, FHWA, MARAD and Volpe for several months. <P> Oracle Consulting has been the systems integrator and primary source of consulting services throughout the long and complex implementation of Oracle Federal Financials, starting with the initial planning and continuing through the development of the "Global Build" and the conversion of the 10 OAs now in production.  During this time, Oracle Consulting has gained an in-depth understanding of each OA's accounting processes and financial management requirements.  Due to the support Oracle Consulting has provided and their analysis of OA processes and requirements, the Oracle Consulting staff has developed a unique combined understanding of the OAs' requirements as they can best be met by and meshed with the best practices inherent in the Oracle Federal Financials COTS software.  No other vendor possesses this unique combined understanding, which was developed based on several years of requirements identification, in-depth analysis, and solution design, testing and implementatio! n. <P> With the large scale, complex FAA and FHWA conversions scheduled for November and December, changing the system integrator for the Delphi project at this time would present a very high and unacceptable risk for this project.  No other system integrator has the knowledge and in-depth understanding of DOT's accounting processes and requirements and how they can best be met by Oracle Federal Financials.  Changing  the system integrator at this point would almost certainly result in large, very costly delays in the conversions of FAA and FHWA from the legacy system and would severely denigrate faith in the ability of Delphi to meet DOT's needs, which is very critical at this early point in the life cycle of the new accounting system.  It would also adversely affect the MARAD and Volpe conversions in early 2003. <P> To avoid these significant risks and to maintain the schedule for the Delphi project, DOT has determined that no other system integrator is able to provide the required services.  Therefore, DOT must award a sole source contract to Oracle Consulting to ensure the continued success of the Delphi project. <P> It is the intent of the FAA to award a contract to Oracle Corporation under the authority of Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.2.4 - Single Source Selection Procurement Process, Subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, non-emergencies. <P> Interested parties who do not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly who can meet the requirements called for in this announcement should respond by 3:00 PM EST, October 7, 2002 with their documentation in writing to: <P> FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Lisa Ferrante, ACX-52 Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405. <P>   The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the request for information, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. <P>

The contract will also include a Software License Agreement fee for AHWCS software to be used in the Encapsulated Harpoon Command and Launch System (EHCLS II).  Boeing, as the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of AHWCS, possesses the specialized experience, unique knowledge base, and technical capability to provide this effort in the required timeframe.  In addition, because Boeing used private corporate funds for the design and development, the AHWCS software and equipment architecture is proprietary, and it is not economically feasible for the Navy to acquire unlimited rights.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to non-competitively procure Data Transfer Systems and Data Transfer System subassemblies with one year warranty, integration, and installation.  The data switching equipment implements a design jointly developed by the Government and Cable & Computer Technology, Inc. under contract N00l78-96-D-2001 and currently produced under contract N00178-02-D-2014.  The required data switching system simultaneously switches multiple, dissimilar Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) serial, parallel, digital video, and standard Navy synchro signal types.  The system is expandable to over 2000 ports operating without blocking or trunking. The system operates under a single controller previously developed by the Government. The modularly configurable system provides very low latency and very low bit error rates. The system transmits NTDS signals over distances up to 300 meters between components while remaining transparent to the sending and receiving equipment.  All components to be delivered shall be form, fit, and function matches at the LRU level to items delivered under the contracts previously mentioned.   NSWCDD will award a five-year ID/IQ contract with fixed price pricing provision to Cable & Computer Technology, Inc., Anaheim, CA.   Delivery of each complete data switching system or subassembly is required ten months after receipt of order.  The minimum guaranteed obligation is two 256-port data switching systems.  An estimated maximum quantity of twenty complete data switching systems and additional components may be ordered over the five-year period.  Solicitation N00178-03-R-2001 for this requirement will be issued on or about 15 November 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.   Outside inquiries must be submitted in writing to Contracting Officer, NSWCDD, Attn: XDS12C, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100 or XDS12@nswc.navy.mil.  Interested parties other than Cable & Computer Technology, Inc. must be able to demonstrate their capability to provide the requested equipment. See Notes 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source contract to Raytheon Technical Services, Norfolk, VA., for the acquisition of Intermediate Level Test Equipment (ILTE) to support the AN/AQS-20A towed body.  The ILTE will be used at Intermediate Level (I-Level) maintenance activities to fault isolate, troubleshoot, and determine the Towed Body is Ready for Issue (RFI).  Under this contract, Raytheon will design and fabricate two (2) ILTE for the AN/AQS-20A Towed Body.  This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition because Raytheon is the sole developer of the AN/AQS-20A towed body and the Government does not possess the technical data required for competition.  Also, the top-side electronics of the AN/AQS-20A towed body, such as Test Tow Cable, Towed Body Power Supply, Common Test Pla tform enclosure, and Media Converter are very similar and in most cases identical to the top side electronics of the ITLE. Therefore the Government would have to undergo an expensive and extensive development program to develop a new ITLE to test the AN/AQS-20A towed body.

The essence of the TM is to professionally diagnose the spiritual, physical and mental health of all students and provide a therapeutic program, which remedies the specific need identified in the diagnosis.  To accomplish this goal a system for diagnosing students and matching them with the programs and services that they need was developed.  This evaluation program is two fold.  On one end the information gathered is used to demonstrate the overall progress of the school (Outcome Evaluation) and the other end is used for diagnosis (Process Evaluation).  The TM shall be a collaborative effort between the sites. Local school staff and administrators need to be included in the process of developing details of the evaluation.  If there is a change in outcomes over time, the process evaluation makes the connection between those outcomes and the program or other circumstances that may have caused it.  The purpose of this requirement is to prepare materials and facilitate training and debriefing sessions with on-site evaluations, school administrators, or Government officials as requested by the Project Officer; conduct site visits to do site assessments, program development, monitoring, and data collection, which includes overseeing administration of survey questionnaires, examine, collect and tabulate, as necessary, school data on absences, behavior incidents, proficiency drop-outs, and dosage of TRM programs; collect survey data; design and carry out analyses, and produce site-specific and group reports.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). This BAA is also listed at http://www.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). I. INTRODUCTION.  PMA 231 E-2/C-2 within the Naval Air Systems Command seeks proposals describing innovative and practical reasoning algorithm technology that supports multi-source integration and data fusion with the E-2C's various weapon system sensor tracks to produce a single track with source attributes.  The objectives of the data integration include the following:  (1) "One track for One Piece of Metal" with correlated/associated attributes, leading to decreased operator workload and enhanced situational awareness. (2)Fuse all sources of data/information in a probabilistic manner that supports Combat Identification Technologies.  II. BACKGROUND. The MSI project supports both the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 and the E-2C Radar Modernization Program.  The objective is to create and develop product that enhances operator situational awareness, while supporting Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) requirements and transition to a Network Centric Warfare architecture.  Data fusion is a requirement discussed in the Joint Theater Air Missile Defense Capstone Requirements Document (CRD). BAA respondent's will focus their effort within PMA 231's Advanced Development MSI technical boundary explained in the MSI Proposal Information Package (PIP) and will be expected to develop, demonstrate, and provide software-based computational, multi-source algorithms to improve MSI through data fusion of existing sensors and sources of data within the aircraft's weapon system. This product will additionally serve as a foundation for future Combat Identification technologies. MSI goals of providing automated track association and correlation from various sensors utilizing common algorithms is challenging but necessary to meet emerging requirements and improve overall operator situational awareness.  PMA 231 Advanced Development is leading the development of MSI fusion techniques as key building blocks for the development of a MSI fusion system with potential for demonstration on several future US Naval Weapon Systems. PMA 231 Advanced Development's MSI efforts are focused on employing automated data fusion of existing track data from various on and off-board sensors and sources. These weapon system sensors and sources include the Radar, IFF, CEC, ESM, Link 4/11/16 and SATCOM data feeds. In addition, the broader MSI project objectives beyond those of this BAA may include: 1.Applications of MSI products to supporting a Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) 2. Applications of MSI products to Combat Identification 3.  Utilization of all database/all source information to formulate a composite tactical picture for the purposes of maximizing crew situational awareness and minimizing crew workload. Offerors must review the detailed information on the E-2C Hawkeye MSI Program that can be found in the PIP, which will be available on the NAVAIR AIR 2.0 website on or before 4 September 2002. Approximately $2,250,000 will be available for this BAA.  It is anticipated that three or more awards may be made. Proposed work should be structured to have a period of performance of nine (9) months.  Proposal Due Date: Proposals submitted under this BAA are due no later than 1600 EST, 09 October  2002.  Other Important Dates:  30 August 2002-Bidders Briefing registration; 04 September 2002-Industry Day (Bidders Briefing), Pax River, MD; 09 October 2002-Proposals due. Bidders Briefing - The MSI program will conduct an unclassified briefing for potential bidders on 4 September 2002.

<SUBJECT>F -- Newsome Channel and Riparian Restoration Feasibility Study
<SOLNBR>R1-17-2-38
<CONTACT>Debbie Gerfen, Purchasing Agent, Phone 2089834001, Fax 2089834098, Email dgerfen@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Newsome Channel and Riparian Restoration Feasibility Study - This project will provide a range of conceptual design alternatives for improvement of the Newsome Creek channel and riparian corridor.  The project reach is about 3.5 miles long, the watershed area at the downstream end is about 23 square miles, the valley floor width averages about 200-300 feet, and the bankfull channel width is about 27 feet.  Much of the valley floor through the project reach was dredge mined in the early part of the 20th century.  Instream fish habitat improvement structures were placed in portions of the stream in the 1970s and 1980s.  A system trail, designated for non-motorized access, exists on the valley floor and crosses the stream with fords in several locations.

The objectives of the restoration work are to improve channel morphology, water quality, fish habitat, and riparian conditions.  Anticipated measures to meet the objectives include reconfiguration and/or relocation of the stream channel, reshaping and relocation of mine tailings, reestablishment of floodplains, instream habitat improvement, soil restoration and revegetation.  Public and administrative access must be maintained along Trail #826, which is present along the length of the project area.

The expected product of the feasibility study is a written report displaying two to four alternatives which address these objectives at various levels.  A basic concept for each alternative will be provided by the Forest Service, in cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe and various agencies.  The vendor will provide information on each alternative, including a narrative description, maps, typical drawings, resource benefits and liabilities, and general costs.  The level of information should be adequate to support evaluation of the alternatives through subsequent processes such as environmental disclosure, threatened and and endangered species consultation, and cultural resources clearance.  Key anticipated skill needs include hydrology, hydraulic engineering, fisheries biology, soils, botany and cultural resources.
   
The project area is located in the headwaters of Newsome Creek, approximately 12 air miles northwest of Elk City,  Idaho.  The area is accessed via State Highway 14, then up Forest Road #1858.  The project area begins at the upstream end of the private land boundary at the Newsome Townsite and continues for about 3.5 miles to near the mouth of Radcliffe Creek.  The project area is located in T30N, R7E, Sections 12, 13, 18, 19, and 30, BM.  Project area and vicinity maps will be posted on the Nez Perce National Forest website (www.fs.fed.us/r1/nezperce/).  This notice will be updated with the complete URL when the maps are posted.

A pre-solicitation site visit is planned for October 22, 2002 starting at 0900 PDT.  Meeting location for the tour is at the junction of State Highway 14 and Newsome Creek Road #1858.  This is located at MP 37 on Highway 14, about 12 miles west of Elk City and about 48 miles east of Grangeville, Idaho.  Prospective bidders are responsible for their own transportation, lunches, and field gear.  Waterproof knee-length or hip boots are recommended as there are several stream fords that will be crossed during the tour.

<DESC>NA The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) intends to identify an interim soft-walled shelter for use in the Deployable Medical System Combat Support Hospital and potentially the Forward Surgical Team.  To ensure that this shelter represents the optimal cost/capa bility solution, the AMEDD plans to evaluate current in-service tentage and alternative commercially available options by 31 December 2002.  The AMEDD intends to execute this evaluation in a two-stage process.  The first stage is to gather product informat ion and literature on existing, commercially available soft shelter systems from industry and DoD sources by 25 October 2002.  The shelters will then be evaluated using the responses and other data sources available to the Government.  The stage one evalua tion will focus on the following user defined evaluation criteria:  internal and external dimensions, operational use, physical design, environmental performance, component material composition, support systems integration, reliability and maintainability,  logistics, interoperability with existing military systems, and cost. On 6 November 2002, up to 5 of the top-rated shelter system manufacturers will then be asked to deliver, on loan, their soft shelter system to the Army no later than 21 November 2002 an d provide user training if required.  The AMEDD will conduct an evaluation from 2-13 December 2002 that will focus on the form, fit, and function of each shelter as they relate to use by the AMEDD.  Environmental performance data will be obtained from prio r Government tests, if available. Vendors participating in this process with be provided a copy of the Governments evaluation of their product only. If interested in receiving a detailed questionnaire and additional information, please direct your respons es and/or questions to the Mr. Mark Zienda by 25 October 2002.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Lockheed Martin Missile Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D), 1701 W. Marshall Drive, Grand Prairie, TX  75051.  LMMFC-D is the only known qualified source to perform this effort.  Modifications are required to the existing LOCAAS Engagement Analysis Program and Simulation (LEAPS).  The modifications will upgrade LEAPS in several areas to include the development and incorporation of the current Silicon Graphics ONYX based munition simulation onto distributed personal computers platform.  In addition, the modification to LEAPS will include the development of a MATLAB/Simulink compatible s-function block model that will encapsulate the LMMFC-D developed munition dynamics model.  LEAPS is a LMMFC-D proprietary system, therefore, LMMFC-D is uniquely capable of performing these tasks through their direct experience with the original software development, direct experience with development and implementation of the LEAPS system, as well as, the continued maintenance of the LEAPS software.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience with LEAPS and ability to upgrade LEAPS in the following areas:  (1) Develop and integrate the LEAPS model onto distributed personal computer platforms; (2) Develop and incorporate the LEAPS model into a MATLAB/Simulink compatible S-function.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) is requesting industry information on general purpose processors for Naval and Marine Corps aircraft.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for Proposal or an indication that the Navy will contract for these supplies.  
The Navy is requesting information regarding general purpose processors (Navy terms- Common Cockpit Processors (CCPs)), to achieve Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) functionality  on legacy Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the C-2A, CH-53E, E-2C, P-3, , VH-3D, and VH-60N.  This RFI requests technical information on the capabilities of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) cockpit processors within industry and on future developmental efforts.  Information is also requested on display capabilities and hardware associated with such NDI cockpit processors.

The information obtained will be used to identify potential CCP sources  for use in the aircraft specified above.  Current Navy planning calls for cockpit processors to be available for procurement in FY05 to FY09 and beyond with installation beginning in FY06.

The CCP is expected to provide updated processing capabilities for the Navy?s aging aircraft by providing potential compatibility with civil aviation data links, tactical data links, analog cockpit functions,  and precision approach algorithms.  

Interested parties should provide  budgetary pricing and product information for this RFI no later than 15 November 2002 at the NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND INDUSTRY DAY.   The Navy will not pay for information received nor travel costs incurred in response to this RFI.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Navy seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, UTILITY SYSTEMS: CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY.   Naval support Activity Mid-South is seeking interest and information specifically for the privatization of Electric Distribution utilities system.  The resulting privatization will include assumption of ownership, operation and maintenance, and obligation to continue the service for an indefinite and ongoing period.  
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization result, the ownership of the entire utility plant and/or distribution system, including all operating responsibility shall transfer to a regional or municipal utility or to a private company.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility providers responsibility.  It is intended that privatization will reduce the Navys life cycle costs. 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size and general description of the system.  Any numbers may only be estimates for this purpose.  The NSA Mid-South 12.47KV Electrical Distribution System consists of an overhead and underground power distribution system.  Overhead distribution is conventional wire construction with pole mounted transformers.  Underground distribution utilizes duct type construction and pad mounted transformers.  Power is distributed through 2 Switching Stations: (1) Main SS has 9 vacuum circuit breakers and (2) the secondary SS has 6 vacuum circuit breakers.  There are approximately 60 miles of overhead and 13 miles of underground primary and secondary distribution lines. Maximum electrical demand in 2001 was 14.568 MW.
PROCEDURES: This request for interested parties is for gathering information and is one required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the Department of the Navys utilities privatization program.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  SHOULD INTEREST BE DETERMINED SUFFICIENT, A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE FORTHCOMING.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length).  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to purchase, expand, and operate a utility system; (3) a statement showing its understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4) understanding of any applicable state or local utility law or franchise requirements, and capability of complying with such requirements; (5) understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and its familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state of Tennessee and US Environmental Protection Agency, Region 4.  Elaborate proposals or pricing information is neither required nor desired.  Any innovative and new conceptual ideas to achieve stated objectives are encouraged.

The purpose of the $23 million ceiling increase is to enable the contractor to complete activities that were part of the original scope of work of the contract but that could not be carried out as scheduled under the original contract dollar ceiling after BASICS II was tasked with additional priority work using $23 million of Congressionally-mandated funding for Malaria and Infectious Diseases and Polio Eradication under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of FY 2000 and in conjunction with the FY 2001 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act.  This ongoing Congressional mandate is being implemented by the USAID Administrator's HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Initiatives which authorizes other than full and open competitive procurement to expedite specific activities. 

The higher ceiling will allow BASICS to: 1) complete year-five, on-going Child Survival, Polio, Malaria and Infectious Disease, and Micronutrient activities in the DR Congo, El Salvador, Ghana, Guinea, Honduras, India, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia; 2) support on-going Child Survival, Malaria and Infectious Diseases, and Polio activities in the Global Health and African Regional Bureaus and 3) support on-going Child Survival activities of the LAC and ANE Bureaus.   Because BASICS II is a performance-based contract, it is essential that this work be completed to give the U.S. Government the results anticipated.  See Note: 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Note: 25. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.
