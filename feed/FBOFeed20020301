<DESC>Training and Technical Assistance for the Administration for Native Americans Region 6

Contract 282-99-0046 was awarded to RJS and Assiciates on September 30, 1999 for Training and Technical Services to Current and Prospective Grantee Organizations of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), Region 6.  The contract is currently due to expire on March 31, 2002.  Due to programmatic changes at the Administration for Native Americans, the lateness in appointment of a new commissioner, and indispensable nature of the services being provided under the contract, ANA intends to issue a six months extension to the contract.  This extension will allow ANA adequate time to compete and award a new contract for these services.

<DESC>Training and Technical Assistance for the Administration for Native Americans Region 4

Contract 282-99-0037 was awarded to Native American Management Services on September 30, 1999 for Training and Technical Services to Current and Prospective Grantee Organizations of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), Region 4.  The contract is currently due to expire on March 31, 2002.  Due to programmatic changes at the Administration for Native Americans, the lateness in appointment of a new commissioner, and indispensable nature of the services being provided under the contract, ANA intends to issue a six months extension to the contract.  This extension will allow ANA adequate time to compete and award a new contract for these services.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT AN ACQUISITION PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION.  THIS SYNOPSIS PROVIDES NOTICE THAT THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA) PLANS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL RESULT IN COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AWARDS. The Safety Core Business Unit of the FHWA is contemplating the award of multiple (approximately 2 to 4) demonstration and evaluation projects for a performance period of 20 months.  Individual award amounts are expected to range between $150,000 ? $300,000.  The maximum federal funding for any single project will be $300,000.  Applicants must provide a minimum of a 20 percent match of the Federal funding towards the project.  The applicant?s 20 percent match requirement can be met through direct financial contribution or through ?in-kind? services.  This request for application (RFA) will only be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Accordingly, NO written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the RFA package will be accepted. The Government anticipates issuing a RFA package on or about 03/18/02 by posting it on the website www.fedbizopps.gov. Estimated proposal due date is on or about 04/18/02. Since this RFA will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps.gov website for both the RFA package and any amendments.  The objective of the demonstration and evaluation projects is to determine the extent to which rationally established, well-publicized, and rigorously enforced speed limits lead to higher compliance and improved safety.  Each recipient will (1) conduct a carefully planned demonstration of setting and enforcing rational speed limits; (2) designate a specific demonstration community (or group of communities); (3) conduct an engineering study of selected road segments (controlled access roads are excluded) and revise the speed limits on those road segments using a rational speed limits approach; (4) implement and maintain a speed enforcement program and provide public information in the demonstration community to fully inform drivers of both the speed management program?s rationale and the planned enforcement program; (5) collect data on speeds as well as on public outreach and enforcement throughout the demonstration period; and (6) designate, or at least suggest, a similar community with comparable road segments that can be used as a comparison site during this demonstration.  All questions, comments, or concerns, shall be e-mailed to Lise Lyles, Contract Specialist, at Lise.Lyles@fhwa.dot.gov.

Contract 282-99-0008 was awarded to RJS and Associates on December 29, 1998 for Training and Technical Services to Current and Prospective Grantee Organizations of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), Region 2.  The contract is currently due to expire on March 31, 2002.  Due to programmatic changes at the Administration for Native Americans, the lateness in appointment of a new commissioner, and indispensable nature of the services being provided under the contract, ANA intends to issue a six months extension to the contract.  This extension will allow ANA adequate time to compete and award a new contract for these services.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease?a burden borne by every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over the world.   Within this mission falls gene discovery. Gene discovery elucidates the cause of some diseases, and also, the underlying pathogenesis of related disorders. Genetic studies of neurological disorders are increasing in number and complexity.  Such studies require a large and diverse sample and accompanying information base. Thus, a repository of DNA samples, immortalized cell lines (from which DNA can be extracted continuously), and accompanying clinical and pedigree data is clearly an invaluable resource for the neuroscience community.  This project, is conceptually related to repositories in existence at other institutes at the NIH.  To date, no such resource has been available to the investigators studying the genetics of Neurological diseases. An NINDS repository will allow receipt, storage, maintenance, standardization, quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to research in Neurological diseases.  This will allow sharing of resources, as mandated by NIH policy, and thus will encourage work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields.  It will ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decrease duplicative sampling efforts.  Personnel with established expertise in DNA preparation, lymphoblast immortalization/cell line preparation, data management, power analysis/statistical support for genetic studies, biological materials receipt/distribution, and subject identify protection, will be needed to perform this research.  It is anticipated that one award may be made for a period of five years in September 2002.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  It will be available at the following websites: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/ or http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm ,15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING EITHER WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. FERC02RMT22281 is issued as a Request for Proposal and all provisions/clauses are those through FAC 04, effective as of 2/20/02. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS Code 541690, size standard not to exceed $5M. Statement of Work: The Division of Market Development is seeking assistance for its staff to familiarize itself on how Energy Trading and Risk Management affect the wholesale market for electricity and natural gas which the Commission Regulates. The consultant will provide assistance on likely causes of market behavior such as bidding in a manner that appears to be at odds with what fundamental factors would seem to dictate or what may be known as ?strategic bidding.? The successful applicant (consultant) will also assist staff in developing analytic tools to measure market performance and specific aspects that affect this performance such as liquidity and market power. The consultant will not be considered advisory in any capacity for contested cases before the Commission or for matters of enforcement of rules. Rather, the consultant will be a resource on call for Market Development staff to assist in answering questions on market behavior, to conduct periodic training on market dynamics and in assessment of market performance. The purpose is to not only assist the staff in the performance of its current work but to help staff develop its own expertise in this area. In addition to assisting staff in market assessment and training, the consultant will also provide some guidance on the Commission?s market tests, which are intended to measure the relative competitiveness of markets under its jurisdiction. As the Division of Market Development is likely to become part of the new office of market Oversight and Investigation, the consultant will help provide assistance in the production of anticipated products such as the ?Seasonal Market Assessments.? While the ultimate decision on the development of these tools and products will be with the Commission and staff, the consultant should be prepared to provide critical analysis of these efforts. The consultant must be able to provide resources on an ?on-call? basis. While the consultant does not necessarily have to work on-site, the consultant must be available to the staff for consultation by phone and on-site work within a reasonable amount of notice. Other personnel provided by the consultant to fulfill his/her service obligations must meet the qualifications as stated in the evaluation factors and must be cleared of any possible organizational conflicts of interest prior to performance. The period of performance for this contract will be for one year and will include a one-year option period. The consultant must provide quarterly reports on the activities performed on behalf of staff and in order to fulfill the requirements of this statement of work. The quarterly report shall contain the purpose for any activities, emphasize progress, the procedures performed, problems encountered, actions taken, the results or conclusions thereof, any recommendations for improvements, and planned actions. Travel will be reimbursed at current DOD Joint Travel Regulations rates. All offerors and subcontractors must complete and submit with their proposals, either the Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) representation or the OCI disclosure (not both). Complete and submit the OCI Questionnaire. Request OCI information from C. Handley. See DOE clauses 952.209-8 OCI-Disclosure and 952.209-72 OCI. Same/similar language will be incorporated into the resultant contract. The estimated start date is April 15, 2002. FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (Oct 2000), applies. Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH (b) Reply by e- mail the proposal to charlotte.handley@ferc.gov.

In addition, the offeror must be able to: measure market performance using empirical indicators of the exercise of market power and market efficiency; analyze market data to develop quantitative assessment of market performance; provide assistance in identifying the causes of strategic bidding patterns; train staff on market dynamics and assessment of market performance; develop models and summaries to assess the strength of the market and market rules; develop analytical tools to measure market performance; and develop and access relevant public and proprietary databases and sources.  The offeror must demonstrate the ability to help to prepare periodic state-of-the-market reports on the various performance indicators and structural features of energy markets.   The offeror must be competent working with large volumes of data and performing computer-based analysis or modeling using a software application such as Statistical Analysis System (SAS).

For the purposes of this evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means the offeror will receive a rating of "good or acceptable" on company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from C. Handley by email. The Offeror will be responsible and ensure that the references reply by e-mail their completed response to C. Handley by 2:00 PM local time, March 15, 2002. Professional Qualifications (20 points).

The following nine factors will be used in the selection of the firms: (1) Specialized in-house experience in the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, including automated hydrologic and hydraulic applications, in flood insurance Studies/Restudies (20 points); (2) Specialized experience of key personnel in hydrology and open channel hydraulics for purposes of flood risk assessment and floodplain maps (20 points); (3) Experience in development and use of the digital terrain models and databases used for managing spatial data (15 points); (4) Demonstrated experience of the firm in the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in civil engineering applications (10 points);
(5) Capacity of the firm?s office to initiate disaster recovery map activities within two weeks notice (10 points); (6) Demonstrated experience of the firm and key personnel in performing studies/restudies for studies/restudies for bridge and drainage design, and in hydraulic modeling of flood control works, reservoir planning and open channel hydraulics (10 points); (7) Past performance of firm on flood insurance studies/restudies or related work of a similar magnitude and complexity in risk assessment/flood plain information studies/restudies with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules (5 points); (8) Experience of firm in working with state and local governmental authorities in technical consultation in risk assessment studies/restudies (5 points); and (9) Geographical proximity of the firm?s home/regional branch offices where work is to be performed relative to the primary geographic area.  Distribution of points will be based on the proximity of this office to the state or states identified as primary geographic area (5 points). Following an in-depth evaluation of the qualification performance data submitted, three or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of service required will be selected for a ?short list?. Firms on the ?short list? will receive a facsimile notice of their selection and will be given written questions to be answered orally over the telephone (conference call) within approximately twenty four (24) hours of notification. Upon receipt of the ?short list? responses a final evaluation and selection of the most qualified firm(s), for each procurement, will be made. A proposal will be requested, and negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most preferred firm(s) in the selection, and will proceed until an award or awards are made or all of the short-listed firms have been rejected.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with University of Michigan, to perform the work of estimating emission rates of metals based on measurements from on-road vehicles, analyzing metal concentrations in fuel and oil of test vehicles, collecting representative gas and particle phase samples of test vehicle tailpipe emissions, and replicating and validating measurements taken by University of Michigan at the Fort McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore MD as reported in the document "Mobile Source Profile Determination: Ft. McHenry  Traffic Tunnel Study Mercury Data Report to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection " (Keeler, G.J., Dvonch, J.T. Barres, J.A.; 1999). The U.S. EPA requires duplication of the previous sampling methods used for the tunnel study results in order to compare with the study results for this project that is to be performed at the U.S. EPA laboratory in Ann Arbor Michigan using test vehicles. The University of Michigan was the only contractor able to collect measurable mercury samples at the Ft. McHenry tunnel project in 1999. Validation sampling requires using the same laboratory, methods, and equipment previously used. The University of Michigan developed the method, possesses the necessary expertise and equipment, and is the only known source for validating the 1999 measurements and performing this new EPA requirement.  Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) which allows for contracting without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the needs of the agency. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements by submitting appropriate documentation to the office identified above, Attn: Les Bodine.   Documentation must be received by the EPA within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis in order to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  You may fax your information to 513-487-2107.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Genetics Branch, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Marine Biotech Inc., 54A West Dane Street, Unit A, Beverly, MA 01915 for a Z-Mod Photoperiod Zebrafish Holding System, for research investigating the molecular mechanisms that lead to acute leukemia.  The Genetics Branch has used a number of pre-clinical models of leukemia, including tissue culture cells and mouse models, however, because of the limitations in other systems, the Genetics Branch is interested in developing additional pre-clinical model systems.  The Genetics Branch has turned to Zebrafish as an additional system.  Zebrafish embryos are transparent and easy to observe and can produce hundreds of easily manipulated eggs within a few hours.  In addition, genetic "tools", such as BAC and EST clones, mapping panels, and large scale mutagenesis screens are rapidly becoming available for zebrafish.  Since gynogenetic fish can develop to adulthood, the Genetics Branch sees great potential for the use of these fish in screens for tumor suppressor genes.  Despite the promise of zebrafish in cancer research, there have been no known reports thus far of genetically modified zebrafish developing hematopoietic malignancy.  The Z-Mod Photoperiod Holding System will be used to house the zebrafish.  The system must be capable of the following: 1) house up to 84 individual tanks containing 15-30 fish per tank; 2) equipped with 6 racks of 14-2 liter tanks, 3) continuously filtered life-support system capable of re-circulating water, with sequential particulate filters; biologic filters, and ultraviolet sterilization; 4) 80 GPD reverse osmosis water delivery system with 2 plexiglass holding tanks and catchment trays; 5) sump-pump to discharge any overflow along with a scheduled 10% daily water change; 6)photperiod doors with programmable timers that allow tanks to be enclosed in a light-tight environment(light-dark settings), with all tanks being uniformly exposed to the same light intensity; 7)the system must be capable of allowing numerous interchangeable small tanks, with sizes ranging from 3/4 liters to 4 liters.  Marine Biotech Inc., is the only source known to the NCI researchers that can provide one complete system for the required research.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statment and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 P.M. EST on March 12, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commerical item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considereed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  See numbered note 1.

These systems utilize Sequenom proprietary software.  All parts and items used must be compatible with the existing system to maintain operability and consistency in research studies. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracts office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on March 8, 2002.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

NTI is seeking proposals from video production firms to produce a series of safety and security training videos.  The subcontractor shall be responsible for all facets of video production including scriptwriting, storyboarding, pre-production coordination, shooting, editing and post-production coordination. The videos will be developed as teaching aids for instructor-led training as well as stand-alone instructional material.  NTI will provide the subcontractor with the resource material needed to develop the script and access to subject matter experts.  In most cases, the video will be based upon existing material already developed in other course delivery formats.  The videos will address the unique application of safety and security information, policies and procedures to the transit environment. 

It is anticipated that NTI will need to produce up to twenty-four (24) videos the three (3) base years of the contract and up to sixteen (16) for the option year, if exercised.  The videos will range in length from ten minutes to approximately one hour. Selecting a subcontractor to work with on a recurring basis is preferable because the quality and production efficiency will be greatly increased by cultivating expertise in a subcontractor regarding transit issues and shooting video in the transit environment. In addition, a consistency in the creative and production aspects is desired.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted; telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFP?s will not be faxed.  Requests for RFPs will be honored through Thursday, March 21, 2002.

These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

The HIV Vaccine Design and Development Teams (HVDDT) solicitation seeks to fund consortia of scientists with development experience from industry and/or academia that have 1) identified a promising vaccine concept, and 2) devised a plan for its targeted development into a vaccine product.  A vaccine product is defined here to be a material and its manner of administration that could reasonably provide protection against AIDS.  Offerors are encouraged, but not required to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with NIAID/DAIDS-supported HIV/AIDS vaccine trials networks.  Support for phase III studies will not be funded under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNM) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the development of Hard Target Influence Fuze Technology (HTIFT) to functionally defeat and/or deny access to facilities and areas.  Proposals in response to this PRDA shall be submitted by 15 March 2002, 1500 hours Central Standard Time, to AFRL/MNK, Attn: Martin Kradlak, Bldg 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  Responses must reference solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0001.  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert for any PRDA amendments that may be published.  This is an unrestricted solicitation.  Proposal receipt after the cutoff date and time specified herein shall be treated in accordance with restrictions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3); a copy of this provision may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. Offerors may request a copy of the July 2000 AFRL publication entitled, "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) Industry Guide."  This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the BAA/PRDA proposal process.  The document may also be viewed and downloaded at http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf. 
 
BACKGROUND:  In many cases denying access or inhibiting function is the only viable method for attacking certain targets.  In the past, unitary weapons have been utilized to deny access, but they could not be placed accurately at their intended target to accomplish their mission without the use of excessive numbers of weapons.  Existing guidance kits are capable of providing the required accuracy of emplacement for larger devices.  However, an influence fuze capable of being housed entirely within the aft 3" diameter fuze well is needed to completely fulfill the following requirements.
 
REQUIREMENTS:  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain proposals to evaluate candidate technologies for the Hard Target Influence Fuze system, to design, fabricate and test a module capable of sensing and discriminating both military vehicles and clearing equipment from other vehicles, and to develop a preliminary design of the fuze system.  The system design must show a path to a tactical fuze that will reside within a single cylindrical package which fits within the 3" diameter rear fuze well of inventory weapons is combatable with existing guidance kits, and survives anticipated impact forces.
 
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  This program will last approximately 42 months, during which time, the offeror shall perform a requirements analysis, prepare a preliminary performance specification, investigate candidate component technologies for the vehicle sensing and discrimination module, develop a preliminary Hard Target Influence Fuze system design, and build Bread Board Technology Demonstrator (BBTD) evaluation units of their sensing module.  The BBTD evaluation units' performance shall be fully evaluated in contractor tests and these preliminary BBTD test results shall be delivered to the government within 30 days of test completion.  Upon approval of the government, the HTIFT BBTD evaluation units' performance shall then be evaluated by the government in a series of shock survivability tests and vehicle sensing and discrimination tests.  Upon completion of this testing, the contractor shall evaluate the results of the tests, refine the design, and build BBTD demonstration units based on the redesign.  Upon approval of the government, the HTIFT BBTD demonstration units' performance shall then be evaluated by the government in a series of shock survivability tests and vehicle sensing and discrimination tests.  A final technical report covering the component technology investigation, sensor module design, construction, contractor testing, and performance evaluation of the BBTD evaluation and demonstration units and the preliminary design and physical model of the fuze system shall be delivered to the government.  The proposed HTIFT vehicle-sensing module must meet the following requirements:
Detection and discrimination of military vehicles and large clearing equipment from other vehicles and the activation of the weapon at the point of closest approach within the weapon's lethal range.
Maximized constant surveillance duration.
Survivability of the shock loads associated with MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, and BLU-109 warheads (with inventory guidance kits) impacting targets ranging from soft soil to granite.
 
The proposed preliminary fuze design must meet the following requirements:
The potential to develop an influence fuze unit which will fit entirely within the 3" diameter rear fuze well of standard inventory weapons, utilizing existing guidance kits.
The potential to power this fuze unit for the maximized surveillance duration using a power source which fits entirely within the fuze unit.
Expected survivability of the shock associated with MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, and BLU-109 warheads (with inventory guidance kits) impacting targets ranging from soft soil to granite.
Show a path to a tactical fuze.
Meet the requirements of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 64 (http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd-64.htm).
 
DELIVERABLE ITEMS: The following deliverable data items shall be proposed:
 
-	Monthly Reports
-	BBTD evaluation units
-	BBTD Demonstration Units
-	Final Report
-	Preliminary Fuze Design Model
 
REVIEWS:  The contractors shall plan, prepare for, and conduct program reviews at 6 month intervals throughout the program.  A Kickoff Meeting shall be held at the contractor's facility and a Final Review shall be held at Eglin AFB, FL.  The remainder of the reviews will be held alternately at the contractors' facilities and at Eglin AFB, FL.
 
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  Performing this research will require the contractor to have access to US Government classified information at the SECRET level. Contact Martin Kradlak, AFRL/MNK, for copy of DD Form 254.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 97-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541519 with a small business size standard of $18.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Infinite Global Infrastructures LLC (IGI LLC), West Chicago, Illinois, to provide expert network support services.  These services are required to support the development of  NLM's telecommunications network for malaria researchers in developing countries.  These services are required for testing, evaluation, development, performance measurement, demonstration, and technology assessment of satellite and terrestrial based biomedical communications systems.  Services include but are not limited to investigation of alternative strategies to improve end-to-end performance by methods, such as, but not limited to, bandwidth efficient modulation schemes, data caching, and system optimization.  This network supports, in a cost effective and efficient way, a broad spectrum of basic and operational malaria research needs currently in Africa.  NLM chairs the Communications Working Group (CWG) of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM), which began in 1997.  The objective of this program is to support African scientists and malaria researchers to connect with one another and to sources of information through full access to the Internet and the resources of the World Wide Web, as well as to create new collaborations and partnerships.  Specifically, the vendor shall perform the following tasks:  1) quantitatively evaluate and characterize the current data traffic on the MIMcom network;  2) develop, demonstrate and evaluate strategies to optimize end-to-end data throughout between MIMcom sites and NLM, and among MIMcom sites for data types.  Data types include but are not limited to:  text (email, database search results), voice over frame-relay, video conferencing, point-to-multipoint video broadcasts and any other IP or UDP-based traffic that can be readily identified; 3) implement one or more optimization strategies in the network and measure performance to quantify improvement; 4) document designs, guidelines and best practice recommendations for long term operation of the network; 5) assess, propose, demonstrate and/or report on possible next generation or alternative telecommunications architectures for serving current and future MIMcom participants.  IGI LLC has five years experience in working on telecommunication systems end-to-end and has specialists in the satellite, terrestrial, and wireless networks of interest to the Government.  They have designed, integrated, and deployed networks, all services desired by the Government, for the research, education and private sectors.  In 1996, Mr. Beering, IGI LLC's principal, assisted NLM in designing and operating an experimental high-performance demonstration network which lead to a successful demonstration of the first Video-over-Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) from National Institutes of Health (NIH) to the Radiological Society of North America's annual meeting held in Chicago, Illinois.  IGI LLC has design and deployment experience with complex communication systems and services, including multimedia, in a variety of environments including deployment on naval vessels.  They have experience with C-Band, Ku-Band, and S-Band satellites as well as the NASA Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS).  They have the experience necessary to evaluate current technologies and evaluate and modify TCP/IP-based networks.  Because of IGI LLC's unique technical expertise with complex communication systems and services in a variety of environments and willingness to work in extreme environments and remote areas, NLM has determined that IGI LLC is the only source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience who can successfully perform the required tasks.  Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this purchase order.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Ion Ivanescu, Director, Refining Division, SNP PETROM SA, 109 Calea Victoriei, 70176 Bucharest ? Romania, Phone:  + (40) 1 659 7051, Fax: + (40) 1 315 9849, Email: i.ivanescu@petrom.ro :  

Feasibility Study for the Alkylation Unit at Petrom?s Petrobrazi Refinery.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to examine the technical and economic viability of installing a new 800,000 metric tons per year (MTY) alkylation unit at Petrom?s Petrobrazi refinery in Romania.

Petrom, the State Oil Company of Romania, is a vertically integrated petroleum company with upstream, downstream and refining assets.  Petrom owns two refineries, Arpechim and Petrobrazi, and a network of 700 service stations in Romania.  Petrom, with approximately 35.4% of the country?s active refinery capacity, is the largest refiner in Romania.  The Aeprchim and Petrobazi refineries have a total capacity of 8 million MTY and, in 2000, processed 5.7 million tons of crude oil, or 53.3% of the total crude oil processed in the entire country.  These refineries can produce a wide range of products including LPG, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, light and heavy fuel, coke, bitumen, lube oils, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.

Petrom, with the help of UOP and Solomon Associates, is developing a long-term master investment plan to reduce costs, improve profitability, increase competitiveness and meet with European Union (EU) product and environmental standards.  A number of projects have already being identified and are at various stages of development.  Petrom is using a mix of internal resources, suppliers? credit, commercial bank loans and EBRD loans to finance these projects.  A feasibility study is needed to assess the technical requirements for the proposed alkylation unit, including the choice of technology, costs and profitability of the desired plant additions.
 
The central objective of this project is to allow the Petrobrazi refinery to produce motor fuels of a grade that is in accordance with the standards set by the EU.  To this end, the feasibility study will examine the technical and economic feasibility of installing a new alkylation unit with a capacity of no less than 120,000 MTY at Petrom?s Petrobrazi refinery.  The study will evaluate the potential domestic and European market for motor fuels as well as the technical, economic and financial aspects.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $154,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before callingTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, April 1, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Isadora Binder, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-708-5141, Fax 202-708-9817, Email Isadora.Binder@ed.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education anticipates that a sole-source contract will be awarded to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to facilitate the "Evaluation of the National Assessment of Educational Progress."  

To carry out the "Evaluation of the National Assessment of Educational Progress," as required by the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" [SEC. 411.(f)(1)(a) and (b)], the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) needs a prestigious, authoritative, and nationally respected organization with direct access to experts in the field of large-scale educational assessment, which includes psychometricians and subject matter specialists.  The evaluation organization needs a strong history, experience in convening expert panels, and a proven ability to produce influential and credible reports. The organization must be known for its objectivity, and its reputation must transcend any appearance of political influence or advocacy.  It must be composed of individuals of exceptional ability and distinguished reputation who are in the front rank of their professions.  NCES has identified NAS as the only organization that can meet its requirements and carry out the work in the manner needed.

Inherent in the work of NAS are its on-going activities in the area of education.  It operates through the use of panels of highly respected experts in many fields, including education.  For the proposed work, it is important to call upon nationally respected experts in educational assessment as well as in several academic subject areas.  NAS has access to people who have expertise in education and educational research as well as people from other disciplines who are also interested in education and education research and who could add to the expert panel.

NAS is ideally positioned in terms of the impact of the results of the study.  It is NAS to which Congress and the public generally turn on especially controversial issues where they want the authoritative judgment of the best scientists and experts brought to bear on an issue.  NAS is the only group that has the public credibility and the ability to recruit pro bono all the people for the panel.

NAS is able to call on a distinguished entity within its organization to assist in the work: the Board on Testing and Assessment.  Its history in using expert panels to examine educational research in the field of large-scale assessments further reinforces its ability, credibility, and uniqueness to do the proposed work.

In addition to its very broad-based expertise, NAS is also unique in its review process.  NAS conducts an extreemly rigorous peer review process and vetting of all reports.  This review process brings with it considerable credibility and a well-structured and respected review infrastructure, important to NCES.  The review will provide a weight that no other organization can provide.

Any business or firm that thinks it is qualified and able to perform this procurement should submit a detailed capability statement outlining its qualifications to Isadora Binder, Contract Specialist, by 5:00 P.M. EST Monday, April 14, 2002.  Statements may be sent via e-mail (isadora.binder@ed.gov) and followed up with a hard copy (U.S. Department of Education, ROB-3, RM 3616, 7th & D Streets SW, Washington, DC 20202-4447).

<DESC>Pursuant to the Authority of 41USC 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, NationalLibrary of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate a sole-source extension of (4) four months to contract number 
N01-LM-7-3512 with Dynamac Corporation. This extension will provide the same Hazardous Substance Data Bank (HSDB) file building support as under the current contract.  The cumulative knowledge and work experience Dynamac gained during performance under the contract makes them uniquely qualified and capable of maintaining these critical services while the follow-on Solicitation RFP NLM-02-100/bkl is being competed, as it is not feasible or cost effective to train a new contractor for the short term of this extension.  The work shall continue to consist of creating new HSDB records, and updating and enhancing existing chemical records with current information extracted from a variety
of scientific and technical sources, including Government documents.This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal. However,all offers received by April 15,2002, for this (4) four month extension will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for the (4) four month period. The anticipated award date of the contract is on or around April 16, 2002.  If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Brenda K. Lee at 301 496-6546 or email address leeb@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS06P02GZC0520 (PCN NIA97007) - Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new, multi-tenant United States Courthouse, in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The United States Courts will be the primary tenant of the new building.  The building is approximately 250,000 gross square feet, including 22 interior parking spaces, at a proposed site location in downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  GSA Heartland Region, Solicitation No. GS06P02GZC0520 (PCN NIA97007).  -The Estimated Construction Cost range is $50 - 60 million.  Point of Contact: GSA Project Manager, John T. Topi, telephone (816) 823-4903, FAX (816) 926-3571, E-mail john.topi@gsa.gov; GSA Contracting Officer, Georgann Butler, telephone (816) 823-4918, FAX (816) 926-3571, E-mail georgann.butler@gsa.gov.  Interested parties may provide submittals as noted below.

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum; metric (System International) construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a courthouse that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, interior parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The building is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities.  A site proposed by the City of Cedar Rapids, at the Southern edge of downtown, adjacent to the Cedar River, is under consideration.  This new project will be an expression of the American architectural tradition and a visual testimony to the enterprise, vigor and stability of the American Government.  The new Courthouse will reflect the dignity of the Courts and invoke the open legal system of the United States, while maintaining current security requirements.  The new Courthouse will become an integral part of downtown Cedar Rapids and should make a distinct architectural statement that it is responsive to the overall urban design quality of life of the burgeoning mixed-use neighborhood.  
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The objective of the selection process is to procure the services of an excellent designer and firm, supported by highly qualified design professionals, who will design a building that exemplifies Design Excellence.  Accordingly, this will be a two (2) stage selection process, under GSA Design Excellence procedures, that will establish the experience and design ability of the Lead Architectural Designer and his/her firm in Stage I and the entire project team's qualifications in Stage II.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building's architecture.  The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  When developing the project team required for Stage II, at least 35% of the design effort, including working drawings, must be performed within the State of Iowa.  The short-listed A/E Firms/Lead Designers shall be required, in Stage II of the selection process, to demonstrate how this will be accomplished.  5% of the Stage II scoring will reflect how the A/E team meets this goal.

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 ?" x 11" format.  The portfolio shouldinclude the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project). Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  

Submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Past Performance on Design (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) for five (5) new construction projects of similar size or complexity completed in the last ten (10) years.  Submittal of less than five (5) projects will result in a lower score.  If more than five projects are submitted, only the first five (5) will be considered.  Projects not completed within the last five (5) years will not be considered.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues such as the integration of energy-conscious and low maintenance design features, and other parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the art courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment.  (3) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) Lead Designer Portfolio (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.

Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  

An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  

For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  A follow-up announcement shall be placed in this publication containing a list of the short-listed firms.  Each firm will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect their entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  Final selection will be based on evaluation of the Stage II submittals and each firm's interview.

The anticipated final A/E contract will include pre-design, schematic design, design development and construction document services.  The contract may include options for bidding services, tenant improvement services and construction contract administration services. Construction documents may require a single bid package, or multiple bid packages.  Construction may be achieved through Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc), also referred to as CM at risk.  The CMc will be involved in the design process, to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and constructability review.  The CMc will continue with construction by separately procuring contracts for construction.

In addition, special studies, reports, planning, programming services, on site surveys (including geotechnical surveys and analyses, topographical and boundary surveys), remediation studies, design and inspection of petroleum-impacted soils and other hazardous materials, value engineering services, construction of courtroom "mock-ups", construction observation services and other design and testing procedures that are common in the construction industry will be provided if so requested by the Government.  In addition, this building will be designed to meet the LEED Silver standard, or greater, as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council.  Where offerors propose in-house staff to provide special services, offerors should demonstrate that the qualifications of in-house personnel are equivalent to that of a consultant.  Inclusion of a "certified fire protection engineer" and a vertical transportation consultant on the Stage II design team is required.  The Lead Architectural Designer of the selected team will be involved in the selection of an artist and development of artwork as part of the Art-in-Architecture program.
Design shall be hard metric (System International - SI).  Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release.  Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated to AutoCAD are not acceptable.  Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards.  Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in native MSOffice 2000, latest release format.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A--Extended Reach Device for Deminers
<SOLNBR>DAAB15-02-R-0019
<RESPDATE>041502
<ARCHDATE>05152002
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communication-Electronics Command (CECOM), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Humanitarian Demining Office proposes a non-competitive acquisition with The Marshall Legacy Institute of Alexandria, VA and it's partner  CZB ioMed of Fayetteville, NC to develop a body powered prosthetic device for demining applications.  This extended reach device will enhance the day-to-day performance and safety of deminers.  A body-powered device will create a universal mounting platform fo r demining hand tools to reduce hand and arm fatigue.  It will increase a deminer's safety by providing up to 24 inches of additional standoff distance from a mine while maintaining fine manipulation controls.  The extended reach will also allow a deminer to have an additional pair of 'hands' since its shoulder-controlled operation is hands-free.  Lastly, a body powered extended reach will provide deminers who have lost limbs from mine related injuries with the ability for continued employment as a deminer.   The body powered extended reach device will be based on modifications to an existing prosthetic device developed by Dr. Chaz Holder of CZBioMed. The device is unlike conventional prosthetic devices in that it does not require surgery and skilled individu als to have it installed on an amputee or individual.  The device is adjustable and can fit a wide range of sizes as well as either arm with only a few minor adjustments.  The operation of the device is through bi-scapular adduction and abduction (moving t he shoulders to arch the back), in combination with residual limb extension.  This device has been proven to work effectively and has seen extensive operation is several developing countries such as Sierre Leone, West Africa.  The Marshall Legacy Institute  and CZBioMed are the only known source for this particular body powered prosthetic device.  The primary tasks will include design and delivery of three prototypes that meet the above criteria.  The modifications to the existing device will include an adju stable reach extender, blast shield, detector suspension mount, and an interchangeable tool quick-disconnect with foldaway hand unit. The duration of this effort is 3 months.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above body powered extended reach de vice may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must possess technical expertise and/or experience building prosthetic/extended reach devices.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages.  Responses are to be received via em ail within 45 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses and requests for additional informat ion to the Mr. Derek Karis, Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  derek.karis@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

      WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter?  This can
 be:

* an existing published wage determination
* a survey underlying a wage determination
* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a
  position on a wage determination matter
* a conformance (additional classification and rate)
  ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program.  If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch
of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

     Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
     Wage and Hour Division
     U. S. Department of Labor
     200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
     Washington, D. C.  20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

          Wage and Hour Administrator
          U.S. Department of Labor
          200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
          Washington, D. C.  20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage payment
data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the
requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review
Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:

          Administrative Review Board
          U. S. Department of Labor
          200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
          Washington, D. C.  20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.
            END OF GENERAL DECISION

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires six (6) firm, fixed-priced, requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennnis (Motschulsky) within the State of New York.  One contract is anticipated for delivery of chemical treatments in Manhattan, a second contract in Brooklyn, a third contract in Western Queens, a forth contract in Eastern Queens, and two contracts on Long Island. This spring APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 13,000 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 163,000 in Manhattan, an estimated 17,000 trees with an estimated total dbh of 213,000 in Brooklyn, an estimated 25,000 trees with an estimated total dbh of 313,000 in Western Queens, an estimated 16,000 trees with an estimated total dbh of 200,000 in Eastern Queens, an estimated 22,000 trees with an estimated 275,000 dbh in Western Long Island, and an estimated 25,000 trees with an estimated total dbh of 313,000 in Eastern Long Island.  Soil injection control treatments are not anticipated.  However, soil injection control treatments may be needed and will be written into each of the requirements type contracts awarded.  The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees. ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal to or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore. This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified. The effective period of the contract will be from April 15, 2002, or date of award, through September 30, 2002, with unilateral options to extend the effective period on a month-by-month basis not to exceed an additional 6 months.  However, Mauget treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, it is anticipated that Mauget trunk injection treatments will be applied from approximately April 22 to June 21, 2002.  No soil injection treatments are planned for the 2002 spring treatment period. Additional applications may be required though out the effective period of the contract on an as needed.  The solicitation (request for proposals - rfp) will be issued on or about March 13, 2002, to prospective offerors.  Offers are due to the Contracting Officer by 1:00 P.M., Central Time, Wednesday, April 3, 2002. SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED. The short 3-week turnaround time is due to the unusual and compelling urgency created by the infestation of ALB.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs, and  other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code: 115310.  Size Standard: $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Interested companies may request a copy of the RFP by sending a fax or e-mail request to the Contracting Officer at (612) 370-2106.  The RFP may be downloaded off the Internet after March 13, 2002, or within 2 days after the issuance of the RFP, from the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>FINAL UPDATE:  The purpose of this synopsis is to advise industry for planning and/or preparation purposes of an A-76 COST COMPARISON STUDY FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE ADVANCED WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY located at Hurlburt Fld, FL. The Contracting office anticipates issuing a Request For Proposal (RFP) using FAR Part 12 and 15 for a one-year basic performance period (includes a 4 month transition period) with seven (7) one-year option periods.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price.  The Contractor will perform the above function in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), and supporting guidance. This action is under 100% small-business set-aside with a NAICS code of 562219 and a size standard of $10.0 M. (THIS IS A CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS POSTINGS.)  The anticipated issue date is NOW on or about 3 Jan 02 with a closing date of on or about 14  FEB 02.  The anticipated site visit date is TO BE ANNOUNCED.  A draft copy of the Source Solicitation Requirements document, Statement of Work (SOW) w/appendixes, and draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is posted at the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fedbizops.gov).  Request interested parties review the drafts and comment on the overall content of the SOW, the source selection documents, QASP, and their relationship to standard commercial practices for this type operation.  The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Also indicate how long would you anticipate the site visit to last.  Any comments provided would not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  All comments shall be forwarded to 16CONS/LGCY, 350 Tully St, Hurlburt Fld, FL  32544; or via e-mail to: Twila Beasley.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business against the size standard.  This is a paperless acquisition.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued.  An in-house cost estimate is being developed and a contract may or may not result.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Genetics Branch, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Marine Biotech Inc., 54A West Dane Street, Unit A, Beverly, MA 01915 for a Z-Mod Photoperiod Zebrafish Holding System, for research investigating the molecular mechanisms that lead to acute leukemia.  The Genetics Branch has used a number of pre-clinical models of leukemia, including tissue culture cells and mouse models, however, because of the limitations in other systems, the Genetics Branch is interested in developing additional pre-clinical model systems.  The Genetics Branch has turned to Zebrafish as an additional system.  Zebrafish embryos are transparent and easy to observe and can produce hundreds of easily manipulated eggs within a few hours.  In addition, genetic "tools", such as BAC and EST clones, mapping panels, and large scale mutagenesis screens are rapidly becoming available for zebrafish.  Since gynogenetic fish can develop to adulthood, the Genetics Branch sees great potential for the use of these fish in screens for tumor suppressor genes.  Despite the promise of zebrafish in cancer research, there have been no known reports thus far of genetically modified zebrafish developing hematopoietic malignancy.  The Z-Mod Photoperiod Holding System will be used to house the zebrafish.  The system must be capable of the following: 1) house up to 84 individual tanks containing 15-30 fish per tank; 2) equipped with 6 racks of 14-2 liter tanks, 3) continuously filtered life-support system capable of re-circulating water, with sequential particulate filters; biologic filters, and ultraviolet sterilization; 4) 80 GPD reverse osmosis water delivery system with 2 plexiglass holding tanks and catchment trays; 5) sump-pump to discharge any overflow along with a scheduled 10% daily water change; 6)photperiod doors with programmable timers that allow tanks to be enclosed in a light-tight environment(light-dark settings), with all tanks being uniformly exposed to the same light intensity; 7)the system must be capable of allowing numerous interchangeable small tanks, with sizes ranging from 3/4 liters to 4 liters.  Marine Biotech Inc., is the only source known to the NCI researchers that can provide one complete system for the required research.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statment and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 P.M. EST on March 12, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commerical item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.

<RESPDATE>031802
<ARCHDATE>04172002
<CONTACT>Rita Belfiori, 410-436-4205
<DESC>NA The combined synopsis/solicitation published on 27 Feb 02 for Grappling Hook, Collapsible (GHC) is amended to include additional information to FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commerical Items, as indicated by capital letters in the revised announcement be low: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332116 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Solicitation DAAD13-02-T-0005 is issued as request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation documen t and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-04.  Requirement is for a commercial off-the-shelf Grappling Hook, Collapsible (GHC).  The GHC shall be a lightweight, portable, and reusable device that can be used by the individual soldier for entry into, and exit from buildings (or other structures) during Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) missions. Since this is the continuation of an on-going program, the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center (RMAC) intends to limit competition to the following vendors, who have been previously identified and have met stringent technical requirements for their GHC: Schaeffer Marine Inc, Tactical and Rescue Equipment, LLC, and Safety Systems Corporation.  RMAC anticipates the award of a firm priced price contract.  The proposed contract will be in two parts.  Part 1 of the contract will include the purchase of a quantity of six (6) GHC (CLIN 0001). The GHC thus purchased will undergo the same testing as initially conducted at the onset of the program. The test conducted will be tensile strength tests on an Inst ron machine to ascertain if the GHC can meet the Governments average yield strength requirement of 1,608 lbs. Part 2 of the contract is an option (CLIN 0002) under which the government reserves the right to exercise the option, with one vendor considering the down-select criteria, to purchase up to an additional 2,400 GHC, based on requirements and availability of funds.  The down-selection evaluation will consist of tests conducted by military users to determine which GHC best meets the requirements. User tests will consist of attaching the GHC to a scaling rope and throwing it onto a second or third story roof (or inside a window). Soldiers will then attempt to climb up the rope and onto the roof (or inside the window). Data generated for the final down-se lection will consist of interviews and questionnaires completed by the test participants at the end of the testing period to determine which GHC best meets the requirements. Questionnaire forms will seek subjective and objective opinions from the user troo ps by utilizing a combination of items that will elicit open-ended comments, written by soldiers, as well as responses to “yes, no and multiple choice” type questions.  The GHC shall meet the following performance requirements: The GHC shall be compatible with the standard clothing and individual equipment (CIE) normally worn, carried, or used by the soldier. No interference with other standard CIE items is acceptable. Th e GHC shall be usable by the 1st to 99th percentile male Soldier. Appropriate dimensions include, but are not limited to, weight, height, and width at chest. These dimensions can be found in the 1988 Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Army personnel: Methods an d Statistics, which is available at http://www-sscom.army.mil/busops. The objective is for the GHC to support the weight of a 99th percentile male Soldier (238 lbs) with his fighting load (25-30 lbs) clearing the assault lead during MOUT operations. The GH C must have a built-in safety factor of no less than 6.0 (which means it supports 268 lbs x 6.0 = 1608 lbs, without bending) to ensure the GHC does not deform when supporting the weight of the Soldier with fighting load. The GHC shall be capable of being collapsed, folded or retracted into a compact shape. The desired weight of the GHC is 1.5 lbs or less. The GHC shall have a 1-inc h opening in the shaft to allow for the attachment of ropes up to 1 inch in diameter. The GHC shall not require any undue logistical considerations. Manpower, personnel, and training shall not be impacted by the use of this item. The GHC shall be capable o f being set-up and ready for operation by an individual Soldier from its collapsed state within 30 seconds. Conversely, the time it takes an individual Soldier to reconfigure the GHC into its collapsed state shall be 30 seconds or less. These tasks shall b e accomplished without the use of tools. The GHC design and construction shall enable it to withstand rigorous usage including, but not limited to cross-country transportation, operation in extreme environments and at high altitudes, operation and storage in open air, and exposure to the elements for extended periods of time. The GHC shall be resistant to wear, abuse, rust, decay, and corrosion in operational climates. The GHC shall operate and function in all climatic types and at all altitudes and tempera tures that fall within the range of –35 degrees F to +120 degrees F.  The GHC shall also be capable of operating during adverse weather and conditions such as, falling snow, sleet, rain, freezing rain, and blowing dirt/sand.  The GHC shall not introduce any unique requirements for maintenance support such as, maintenance facilities, tools, or Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE). No special or new Military Occupational Specialty/Additional Skill Identifier/Special ty Skill Identifier shall be required. Operator maintenance shall be limited to inspecting, cleaning and lubrication. MANPRINT (MANpower and PeRsonnel INTegration) considerations (encompassing the seven domains of manpower, personnel, training, human facto rs, system safety, health hazards and Soldier survivability) shall be integrated into the design of the GHC so as to allow its safe and efficient operation, and maintenance by the Soldier in all specified operational and environmental conditions. System Sa fety and Health: The GHC shall have no uncontrolled safety or health hazards and shall conform to best commercial practices and military standards when applicable. No part of the GHC shall introduce safety or health hazards to the Soldiers when properly us ed, transported, and maintained. Personnel operating the GHC will be able to refer to the operator’s instructions on the packaging. The items shall be preserved, packaged and packed for domestic shipment in accordance with best commercial practice. Shippin g container markings shall be durable and legible and shall include the National Stock Number (NSN) (if applicable), item nomenclature, quantity, weight and cube, contract number, and contractor name and address. Delivery of CLIN 0001 shall be 30 days following issuance of a purchase order; delivery of CLIN 0002 shall be 90 days following exercise of CLIN 0002 option. Delivery of CLIN 0001 shall be FOB Destination to the U.S. Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Co mmand, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  Delivery of CLIN 0002 shall be FOB destination to continental U.S. locations.  Delivery addresses for CLIN 0002 will be included in the modification exercising the option; however, a central point of Pine Bluff Arsenal,  Arkansas, shall be used for pricing purposes.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offers-Commercial, 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  The following factors, which are listed in descending orde r of importance, will be used to evaluate offers for the down-select:  1) Technical:  Capability of how well the GHC meets the performance requirements stated herein.  2) Price:  The proposed total price for GHC for CLINS 0001 and 0002 will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness based on price analysis.  3) Past Performance:  The offeror’s relevant current and past performance in manufacturing and delivering GHC’s or similar items will be evaluated to determine the degree of risk associated with how well the offeror provided a quality product and on-time delivery consistent with a cooperative business manner. TECHNICAL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. PAST PERFORMANCE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN PRICE. TECHNICAL AND PAST PERFORMANC E WHEN COMBINED ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRICE. Offerors should submit an updated technical proposal, which describes the technical performance parameters, as a result of the enhancements made to the GHC. A price per unit shall be submitted fo r both CLINS 0001 and 0002 plus a total price for CLINS 0001 and 0002.  The Past Performance Proposal shall be no longer than three pages and shall contain the names of three references who have purchased the GHC, or similar item, from the offeror, current  reference points of contact and current phone/fax numbers.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 with offer.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala,
Uganda has compiled a series of sector studies and analyses relating to export growth and increased competitiveness in regional and world markets.  These studies, undertaken by consultants funded by USAID, the EU, DFID and UNDP, have been provided to the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance.  The sector studies were also summarized for presentation to the President of Uganda and senior officials of the Government of Uganda.  While the studies include a number of recommendations for the Government of Uganda to consider, these recommendations have not necessarily been adopted.  They will be the subject of ongoing discussions with government, the private sector and donors over the coming months.  The information in these reports may be useful to offerors in preparing proposals in response to RFP 617-02-002.  A compressed file containing these studies and analyses may be obtained from USAID/Uganda by sending an e-mail request to Diana Atungire at datungire@usaid.gov.  
The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the FBO Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the FBO Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions. You
must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the FBO Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from FBO INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are
occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO  Internet site for
amendments.  NAICS:  541611, Competition Level:  Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold):  Estimated Not To Exceed (NTE) $20 million.  See Solicitation, posted January 17, 2002, and Amendment 01, posted February 19, 2002.

<DESC>NA The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is assisting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the removal of asbestos contaminated vermiculite insulation material from the city of Libby, MT.  Approximately 100,000 cubic yards of asbestos contaminated insulation, with the common brand name ZAI Zonolite, is to be transported and disposed. The Volpe Center is conducting market research to determine the most appropriate procurement method(s), and to identify potential sources to provide transport services, disposal services and/or transport and disposal services for the removed ZAI Zonolite insulation.  ZAI Zonolite was used as loose fill attic insulation that was usually blown in or placed by hand in residential and commercial buildings throughout Libb y.  When analyzed by Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM-NIOSH Method 9002) bulk samples of Zonolite insulation typically show levels of amphibole asbestos at <1% and range from non-detect to 5%.  However, when viewed through a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) all of the ZIA Zonolite insulation samples collected by EPA, including those reported as non-detect by PLM, reveal some presence of the amphibole asbestos.  Libby is located within Lincoln County, in the northwest corner of Montana, 35 miles from Idaho and 65 miles south of the Canadian border.  Libby is accessed via Montana Highways 2 and 37 as well as rail lines operated by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway.  The transporter should be fully licensed to haul asbestos contaminated materials and will be required to comply with all fe deral, state and local regulations.  The asbestos contaminated insulation will be disposed at a fully licensed asbestos disposal facility.   The government will be responsible for the removal of ZAI Zonolite from all affected buildings as well as the loading of the insulation into the transport vehicles. Interested transporters and/or disposal sites are required to submit the following information: (1) Company name, company address, contact name, contact phone number, and contact e-mail address, (2) Discussion of the method to be used to transport the material to a disposal site as well as any limitations, restrictions, or conditions for the transport, (3) The location of any proposed disposal facility. (4) Discussion of any treatment method to be used at the disposal facility as well as a ny limitations, restrictions, or conditions on the disposal of the asbestos contaminated material, (5) EPA disposal facility identification number, (6) EPA transporter identification number.  In conducting this market research to determine the most appropriate procurement method(s), interested parties that do not have capacity to transport and dispose of the entire 100,000 cubic yards of material are also encouraged to respond.  The North American Industrial Classification System is 562211.  Interested sources are requested to submit a package by March 15, 2002, no later than 3:00 p.m. local time to the following address: Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attention: Jackson Rector, DTS-852, 55 Broadway Street, Cambridge, MA 02142. For information regarding this sources sought,  contact Jackson Rector, Contracting Officer by email at rector@volpe.dot.gov. All data received in response to this announcement marked or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This is NOT a request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time. The sources sought announcement is requested for informational purposes only. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.

Synopsis # F08635-02-R-0074 - POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT

AAC/PKZA, 205 West D Ave STE 467 Bldg. 350, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6864
    R -- SUSTAINING ENGINEERING SERVICES DUE POC: Ms. Amy Spielman, (850) 882-4603 ext. 4553, Contract Specialist.  The Air Armament Command, Eglin AFB FL is contemplating a sole source award to Communications Solutions, Inc. 10552 Philadelphia Road, White Marsh MD  21162 for the Memorex Program Radar Measurement System.  Sources interested in providing Memorex Program Radar Measurement System in support of the 16th Electronic Warfare Squadron (16 EWS), Eglin AFB FL are hereby sought.  The 53rd Electronic Warfare Group (53 EWG) is responsible for the mission data (MD) reprogramming and testing of the Combat Air Force (CAF) EW systems.  Robust MD test laboratories are maintained to support this testing.  The heart of each of these labs is the threat simulator and the high fidelity threat signals they can produce.  The USAF Resource Enhancement Project (REP) recently provided funding to the 53 EWG to increase the fidelity and timeliness of these simulated signals.  This test program, Project Memorex, will purchase a radar measurement system and use this system to capture radio frequency (RF) emissions from threat systems at Government-owned test ranges.  This system will convert these RF analog signals into digital pulse descriptors that can be imported into the laboratory threat simulators.  The resulting output signals from the threat simulators will be analyzed to verify proper reproduction of the original threat signals.  This effort will purchase the actual radar measurement system that forms the basis for this new test process.  This contract must be awarded as soon as possible to meet one hard requirements of the REP process (that is that all funding must be obligated by 30 Sep 02).  Expeditious award will also support one of the major goals of this REP program.  That goal is to capture as many threat signals as possible and verify proper transfer to the simulators by project completion date of 30 Sep 03.  The contractor shall provide the radar measurement system to support the RF signal capture and digitization required by the Memorex project.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  Interested parties shall submit a capabilities package, which addresses all requirements listed in this announcement.  Submission shall be received no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, 15 March 02.

For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Mel Noble, Program Manager, (850) 882-6964 or e-mail Melvin.noble@eglin.af.mil.  For contractual information, contact Amy M. Spielman (850) 882-4603 ext. 4553 or e-mail amy.spielman@eglin.af.mil.  An ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager identified above.

<RESPDATE>031802
<CONTACT>Sonya Rappoport, Contract Specialist, 973-724-2775
<DESC>Potential source(s) are being sought to adapt, fine-tune and validate a numerical mathematical model for predicting the performance of 200mm Continuous Open Shear Roll Mill (SRM) previously developed by Stevens Institute of  Technology (SIT) for propellant processing at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), Radford Virginia. It is also the objective to convert the numerical  predictive model into interactive simulation software and to develop an on-line  thermal imaging control system software to interface with the 200mm SRM. The model must be sufficiently robust to make predictions of SRM performance at several sizes (200-mm, 300-mm) when processing various propellant formulations such as AA-2 and JA-2. The contractor shall interface with Alliant Techsystems Inc., the operating contractor at Radford AAP, and make available an on-line thermal image camera(s) to collect temperature profiles data on the SRM during the wet inert simulant runs and the initial runs of live AA-2 propellant at RFAAP. Data generated from the previous JA-2 runs at Nitrochemie in Germany and data collected from the live AA-2 trial runs and the wet inert simulant runs on  the ATK 200mm Continuous Open SRM at RFAAP shall be used to fine tune and validate the numerical mathematical model. The purpose of this survey is to identify contractors having the capability to develop and validate such a simulation software/model of the SRM. At a minimum, they should be able to demonstrate the following: .Ability to team with ATK Ammunition and Powder Company, the operating  contractor at Radford Army Ammunition Plant. .Availability of Thermal Image Camera(s) to use on the 200mm SRM at RFAAP for  data collection. .Availability of a prototype SRM process for simulant demonstration runs. .Experience in handling energetic materials.  .Ability to select suitable simulants.  .Ability to specify control equipment to be installed on the SRM for data  acquisition (transducers, etc). Expertise in designing experiments to validate  theoretical model in terms of both mechanical (flow dynamics) and thermal  processes, which are occurring.  .Ability to characterize the rheological behavior (including wall slip)  behavior of energetic materials and simulants.  .Proven capabilities in mathematical modeling and the implementation of  numerical methods particularly with viscoplastic material subject to wall slip. .Possess sufficiently fast computers to run the model within time frames  comparable to the relevant industrial operation.  .Facility suitable for continuously addressing the needs of the Army to run the  mathematical model at relatively short intervals to gain the targeted benefits  from this modeling effort.  .Proprietary information should be properly identified.  Your submission should include organization name/address/point of contact and  phone number, and whether the company is a large or a small business.  If you have any questions regarding this sources sought request, please contact: Mr. Bishara Elmasri,US ARMY TACOM-ARDEC,AMSTA-AR-WEA, Bldg. 321,Picatinny  Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Phone: (973) 724-3298,Fax:     (973) 724-3162 email: belmasri@pica.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Liposuction Cannula Apparatus
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE LLNL'S LIPOSUCTION DEVICE


Announcement:  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking industrial partners to commercialize a liposuction device.

The reciprocating liposuction cannula device utilizes a single cutting shaft, may utilize a combination of reciprocating energy and ultrasonic energy, and may utilize available excess vacuum capacity to produce the reciprocation of the cannula shaft.  One embodiment of the device uses a single shaft for cutting, preferably in a non-rectilinear oscillation motion.  An additional lumen may be utilized for cooling of the cannula tip, equilibrating the pressure, or providing additional pressure to allow fat to move back up the cannula shaft with greater ease.  The combination of reciprocating energy and ultrasonic energy reduces the total energy required of each type.  Also, in this non-rectilinear reciprocating form of the liposuction cannula device, no protective measures (e.g., monitoring tip), need be taken in order to prevent the device from penetrating through important tissues.

This invention is co-owned with two other entities, not related to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  If you are interesed in working with LLNL to commercialize or further develop the Liposuction device described above, please respond in writing within 30 days of this announcement.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Liposuction Device should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-005-292.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is posted to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Liposuction Device.

<SUBJECT>A -- Biological Point Detection Smart Triggers - Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE)
<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (PEOCBD) is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE-02-2) for biological point detection smart-triggers.  The evaluation is scheduled for April 29 - May 10, 2002 at West Jefferson, Ohio.  Devices will be subjected to various biological simulant and interferent aerosols in an outdoor (ambient air source) wind-tunnel environment.  All equipment will need to arrive approximately one week prior to test commencement.   Respondents will be responsible for all costs associated with providing and supporting candidate devices during the TRE.  Participating devices will be assessed for potential inclusion or transitional upgrade into biological defense systems such as the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) and the Joint Portal Shield upgrade.  Each candidate device will be designated a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) with respect to each program.  Devices will be evaluated for their function as automated biological aerosol triggers; the PEOCBD is particularly interested in UV technologies.  Trigger devices will be expected to operate unattended for various increments of time, up to 24 hours between re-set, i.e., system must not require purge and/or re-set after each trial.  Although contractors/operators will not be present during the TRE except for initial daily start-up, they will be expected to be within driving distance to the test sight for emergency/repair purposes.  Each accepted participant shall bring no more than one copy of their device.  Maintenance for performance optimization and algorithm adjustments during operation will not be permitted.  Although the intent of TRE-02-2 is to identify appropriate technology for our developmental/acquisition programs and system upgrades, the PEOCBD is under no obligation to select any of the participating technologies, and no award will be made solely resulting from the TRE.  TRE-02-2 will offer developers an opportunity to obtain unique performance data that can be used in their development work regardless of the TRL that they demonstrate.  All data/information collected during or in preparation of this test will be treated as proprietary. 

To be responsive to this announcement and to receive a copy of the entrance criteria package, developers/sponsors must supply the following in electronic form (CD-ROM or Zip? disk) to PEO CBD, ATTN: SFAE-BD (TRE-02-2), P.O. Box 1729, Falls Church, VA  22041-3203 no later than close of business March 22, 2002:  A description of their device to include its capabilities, technology employed, and physical characteristics; all relevant test reports; a historical synopsis of the development; a photograph of the device.  For all candidates selected to participate in the TRE, there will be a mandatory operators meeting on April 16, 2002 in Falls Church, Virginia.  All questions concerning this announcement can be directed to the Test Manager at 703.681.9600.
