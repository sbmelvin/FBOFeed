<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Region of the Bureau of Reclamation has a need for Class I Inventories, Class III Inventories, Traditional Cultural Property (TCP) Inventories and other cultural resource investigations.  The small business size standard for this acquisition is $6 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three accounting periods, and the NAICS code is 541990. We intend to award one or more ID/IQ contracts, each for a 1-year period with four 1-year Option periods.  The maximum value of any potential contract is $1.5 million, but if more than one contract is awarded it's unlikely any single contract will reach that limitation. We anticipate posting a Request for Proposals (RFP) before the end of April 2003, but all dates in this synopsis are subject to change.  The RFP will issued via our website at www.pn.usbr.gov/contracts but we reserve the right to issue the RFP on paper if the website becomes inoperable or if we determine it's in Reclamation's interest to do so.  Offerors should visit the website after April 7, 2003,  to register to be included on the offeror list to receive convenient e-mail notification of amendments and to encourage subcontracting and partnering/joint venture opportunities.  Offerors will be asked to submit a technical and cost proposal for the ID/IQ contract.  Offers will be evaluated on their successful past performance of similar requirements, the experience and capabilities of their proposed key personnel, proposed prices, and other factors. If more than one ID/IQ contract is awarded, at least one contract will be awarded to a small business.  This requirement is partially set-aside for small businesses (see above).  See Numbered Notes 2 and 26.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 11, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Improvement of Basic Education School Management Study Tour



STATEMENT OF WORK


OBJECTIVE

The objective of this acquisition is to assist the USAID/Guinea Education Team (SO3) in providing a study tour to the United States for twenty (20) Guinean education professionals representing all levels of the educational sector.  The School Management Study Tour supports the Education Team’s Strategic Objective of “providing a quality basic education to a larger percentage of Guinean children with an emphasis on girls and rural children.”  Further, the Study Tour directly supports each of the SO3’s Intermediate Results noted below.  

Intermediate Result 1:  Improved Sectoral Strategic Planning, Management, & Decision-Making
Intermediate Result 2:  Improved Instruction in Basic Education
Intermediate Result 3:  Improved Community Participation in Basic Education
Intermediate Result 4:  Improved Gender and Regional Equity in Basic Education

In March 2002, the Government of Guinea officially launched the Education For All program.  In addition to striving toward universal primary school gross enrollment by 2015, the program also put a focus on financial and administrative decentralization within the education system.  As the Guinean educational system decentralizes its services, the education administrators at each level of the system will require particular knowledge and skills regarding decentralization. 

BACKGROUND

In both 1998 and 1999, USAID/Guinea organized study tours, which focused on “Improving the Quality of Basic Education” at Florida State University for teachers and education officers at all levels within the Guinean educational system.  Both study tours required that upon completion, participants write action plans to be implemented in their communities.  Review of the action plans revealed that many of the participants chose pedagogical rather than managerial themes, although the latter would have been more applicable to their work responsibilities.  Managerial issues at all levels require attention if the management capacity of the Guinean education system is to develop in a sustainable manner.  Education officers need to learn the process of identification of and solutions to problems in a system that differs from current practices.  More importantly, they need to acquire the skills to evaluate, adapt, and implement such management skills into their own management systems.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

The proposed 4-week Improvement of Basic Education School Management study tour will provide an opportunity for the selected participants to observe experiences and techniques currently in use in the United States in the area of school management as well as supervisory structures at all levels of the education sector.  Particular attention is to be given to administrative and financial decentralization, such as decision-making processes, financial management, and the role and relationship of supervisors with their employees.  Emphasis should also be placed on the U.S. decentralized system for curriculum development, teacher training, and student assessment.  Participants should come away with a good understanding of the various roles of education administrators and civil society at the national, state, and local levels as well as the mechanisms for involving parents and other education stakeholders in decisions made at each level.  

In order to maximize the learning experience during the study tour, participants must be able to describe their current school management system, including the identification of management problems that they experience.  The profound understanding of their own system will enable participants to better identify the various management styles that might be applicable to Guinea.  A component of the study tour will be to develop realistic, workable action plans in order to establish efficient management systems and to improve management styles in their own communities.  Upon returning to Guinea, participants will implement their action plans with the technical assistance provided by USAID Education team and/or the training provider.  

DESCRIPTION OF TRAINING 

The training course objectives for this four-week study tour will be focused on the participants’ ability to increase their own skills in areas relevant to Guinea’s educational reform, to reflect on current practices, compare these practices with methods used in American models, and decide how these practices can be adapted and implemented in Guinea.  The contractor is expected to be able to thoroughly present several main themes during the course of the training workshop, including, but not limited to:  
1.	Decentralization (financial and administrative)
2.	Role of the private sector in education
3.	Role of parents and other stakeholders in the decision-making processes
4.	Financing of public education in the U.S.
5.	Equity in education resources and quality between wealthy and poor communities
6.	Relevant themes such as learner-centered instruction, gender equity, student assessment, and the impact of HIV/AIDS on the education system

The contractor will structure the study tour so that cross-cultural experiences and exchanges are maximized.  All aspects of the training are to be designed to provide participants with an opportunity to experience different dimensions of American education and culture, to compare these realities with their own, and to draw conclusions about what is or is not relevant to the specific needs of the Guinean educational sector.  

It is expected that the contractor will incorporate various teaching and training techniques, such as classroom instruction, field visits, hands-on experiences, group work, etc.  

Key components of the study tour will include, but not be limited to:

<SUBJECT>F--Radar detection and survey of marbled murrelets in the South River Resource Area of the BLM, Roseburg Oregon District.
<SOLNBR>HR030327
<RESPDATE>042203
<ARCHDATE>04012004
<CONTACT>Kathleen M. Read Contracting Officer 5414643234     ;
<DESC>The Government has identified an area where marbled murrelets were detected and observed flying below and above the forest canopy during the summer of 2002.  Other areas have also been identified to conduct general radar surveys to evaluate the possibility of murrelet presence. Surveys shall be done during pre-and post dawn hours to collect data on the number, location, direction of flight, and speed of murrelets.  Surveys shall be at two locations in the South River Resource Area.  Contractor shall provide 9-12 survey days during May-August 5 of 2003 and conduct radar surveys three times at each station identified.  Distribution and location of survey sites shall be determined in coordination with Government personnel. The Contractor shall conduct the work as to assure the safety of the general public along public roadways and to assure the protection of persons (public, contractor crew, Government personnel) and properties. Appropriate measures include traffic controls such as but not limited to cones, signs, barricades, and/or flaggers. Camas Valley-Camas Heights Area The overall objective at this site is to use radar to determine how murrelets are accessing Section 1, in Township 30 South, Range 9 West.  The area where occupancy behavior was observed is part of a large (about 310 acres) patch of forest about 40-60 years old, with some remnant trees 70-100 years old.  A couple of small patches of old-growth (?200 years old) are located in the periphery of the young forest.  Topography and noise disturbance from Highway 42 makes these old growth patches hard to survey correctly.  The goal is to determine if murrelets are using the remnant trees in the stand or just flying through as they circle about on the way to the old-growth stands. Murrelets were detected flying at or below the tree canopy (Map 1).  A total of 20 murrelet detections were made between May 28, 2002 and July 25, 2002 where the observer actually saw murrelets.  The   number of murrelets seen ranged from 1 to 4 birds flying sub-canopy or over the forest canopy.  Stand occupancy behavior was documented in this area during 2002.  Eighty percent (16/20) of the detections showed behavior (circling or flying through at or below canopy) indicative of occupancy. Contractor shall establish one to three radar stations and survey each station three (3) times during the survey period.  Contractor shall provide observer(s) with current certification (as per the Pacific Seabird Group's Protocol).  Map 1 shows location of the Camas Heights Area and possible locations for radar stations.  Contractor shall evaluate survey area and adjust location and/or number of radar sites to maximize results following approval from contracting officer.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a sole-source basis with Boeing Aerospace Support via a modification to an existing delivery order to continue development and demonstration of tools to facilitate the transportability of Test Program Sets (TPS).  The AVA Tool currently being developed under the existing Contract N68335-02-G-3117 Statement of Work identified differences in station hardware that must be addressed during the AVA Tool TPS transportability process.  This enhancement will be developed and demonstrated at Boeing on a Government Furnished Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) station using a F-18 Test Program and Unit Under Test.  The most significant differences noted under N68335-02-G-3117 included the quantity and type of measurement and stimulus assets available.  A stimulus solution, using synthetic techniques for the collection and analysis of signals will be demonstrated to satisfy the differences in types and quantities of stimulus assets.  Boeing Aerospace Support as the sole designer and developer of the AVA Tool is the only known firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical data, software and test equipment to enhance the AVA Tool.  Boeing owns propriety rights to the source code.  The Government does not own the technical data.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal.  A successful respondent must have knowledge of the AVA Tool.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation package will be available.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to procure the services on a sole source basis with Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Center for Health Studies, 1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 100, Seattle, Washington 98101.  This request for supplies/services is being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.   In order to meet the growing need to automate data collection and centralize health information that serves the needs of multiple care providers, NCI supported the development of an automated system that efficiently gathers patient information and allows easy updating of existing data in the course of usual clinical care.   The next phase (first phase was performed under purchase order 263-MQ-218301), in evaluating this effort to determine the value of developing NCI initiatives related to this research need is a pilot study to evaluate the usefulness of this tablet version of data related to breast cancer risk in a mammography clinic and validate its usefulness to both patients and staff.  For the benefit of the research efforts within the  Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) sites and for women receiving mammography within clinical practice a computer-based tablet system that allows automated completion and collection of accurate data that can be kept confidential but accessible to those who need it was developed. The application exports data from the tablet in a form that can be adapted to a variety of data systems, provides updated data for elements that change over time, and gathers that information efficiently in the course of usual care.  It accommodates the needs for a high level of data security that insures protection for individuals, is compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)  is structured to add additional elements, and is compatible with other automated data systems to which the information might be exported.  Purpose: The goal of this project is to conduct a 6-month pilot study to evaluate the usefulness of this automated version of data related to breast cancer risk in a mammography clinic.  This observational study shall be conducted among women at the time of their mammogram appointment at a single clinic within GHC.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop an automated tool for use in breast cancer screening centers that reduces burden upon women, facilitates rapid flow of women through the centers, and collects accurate information.  The specific aims of this effort are: 1) To test whether women will use an electronic tablet to complete the automated screening tool, 2) To test whether women accept previously completed answers in the current evaluation, 3) To evaluate the impact of the automated tool on clinic flow, 4) To evaluate the usefulness of a data summary to clinical staff as it pertains to the mammogram appointment and diagnostic process, 5) To determine which aspects of the electronic tool could be improved to allow for greater deployment at other screening centers within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.  Period of Performance: It is anticipated that this pilot study to evaluate the usefulness of an automated version of data related to breast cancer risk in a mammography clinic should require 1 month of advance preparation, five months to administer the evaluation (including recruitment), and 1 month to analyze results.  Total duration of project with review of final report is approximately 6-8 months. FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies. Methods: The evaluation shall include an assessment of patient satisfaction and clinical staff satisfaction to determine acceptance of the automated tool versus a paper tool.  Specifically the technical ease of use, physical ease of use, screen display, interruption of normal clinic flow, response time, ability to correct errors, problem reporting, and the acceptance of prepopulated elements with data from previous assessments shall be evaluated.  The study design shall address the following issues.  Selection of study subjects: Information related to selection of study subjects shall include eligibility criteria related to participation in central mammography screening at GHC between the proposed periods of the study.  In order to evaluate data issues, participants must be part of the Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP) and eligible to fill out the Breast Screening Recruitment and Reminder (BSRR) form.  It is anticipated that women who fit these criteria shall be at least 40 years old and shall not have had another mammogram at GHC within the past 12 months.  Because the goal of this pilot is to evaluate the feasibility of the automated tool among a wide variety of patients, older women may be over-selected since it is more likely that younger women will be familiar with computers and more readily accept using the automated tool.  Women who have previously answered the current version of the paper instrument shall be targeted since they are the only members of the target population who will have pre-populated data.  Identification/recruitment method:  The process for identification of women shall be detailed, including period of selection, process for recruitment, timing of recruitment, consent process, and forms needed for participation in the study.  Women shall be randomly selected to participate in the evaluation of the electronic tool.  Those who are not selected shall be asked to fill out the paper tool and complete an evaluation of the administration process upon completion.  The role of project staff in the recruitment process shall be detailed.   Anticipated number/response rate: The anticipated number of available women and response rate shall be detailed.  This accrual to the study shall be monitored.  The offeror shall provide a plan for how to enhance accrual if it lags behind projected accrual.  The final number of women required to address the specific aims shall be detailed.  Description of intervention(s): The evaluation shall be completely described, including the roles of the patient participants and the project staff.  Samples of the actual script that staff members will use to explain to the patient how to use the device and answer any elements that the patient might have shall be provided.  The proposal shall provide detail on the instrument that will be used to ascertain the woman's experience with the automated tool once she has completed her form and mammogram appointment.  It is anticipated that this interview shall consist of both close-ended satisfaction elements and open-ended elements to elucidate information about the functionality, ease of use, trouble shooting, and overall opinion of the device, the software, and administration of the tool.  A control group of women who are not selected to fill out the automated tool shall also be interviewed after completion of the paper instrument.  In addition, an approach for obtaining relevant demographic information such as age, ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic factors already in the Group Health database for purposes of further characterizing women in this evaluation should be provided.  An evaluation of staff perception of this process shall also be performed in a similar manner with close-ended satisfaction elements, and additional open-ended elements that target the flow of the clinic and the ease of use for clinical staff.  A sample of this evaluation tool shall be provided. Data collection: Data sources and key information obtained from each: Data sources shall be detailed and are anticipated to include mammography patients and clinic staff, consisting of mammogram technologists and radiologists.  The focus of the patient evaluation shall be patient satisfaction with the automated device.  Specifically, elements shall target ease of use, screen display, instructions/terminology, error correction, response time, the input device, prepopulation of data, and overall system usefulness.  Patients shall be asked about their previous experience with technology including ATM usage, calculators, video recorders, etc.  In addition, open-ended elements shall be included that request comment on women's experience with the device including problems that arose during the intervention, aspects of the device that they felt were beneficial, and any improvements they thought could be made.  Mammogram technologists shall be asked elements about the ease of use of the device to obtain information needed during the exam, any interruption in clinic flow that was observed, and their preference for the automated version compared to the paper version.  Radiologists shall be asked elements regarding the ease of use of the device in terms of a summary page that is printed out and faxed to the clinic at the end of the day.  They shall be asked to compare this data summary with that obtained using the paper tool, and to report any problems that arose during the study or suggestions they might have to improve the automated process.   Data collection protocol for a typical subject:  The patient shall be asked to fill out an evaluation form after completing the automated tool at the end of her mammogram appointment.  The evaluation shall consist of a few close-ended elements asking patients to rate their satisfaction with the device for each of the categories listed above.  The patient shall be provided with an opportunity to give open-ended comments on her experience with the device, including both positive and negative comments and suggestions for improving the device.  It is anticipated that the evaluation should be short and take no longer than 10 minutes. The contractor shall present a plan that details the following: 1) Project timeline that details the study design, recruitment of subjects, data collection methods, and analysis plan, 2) Interim progress plan with statistics on recruitment, non-response, and status of patient acceptance of the automated tool and, 3) Final report with descriptive analysis of the pilot study including hardware performance, troubleshooting report, patient acceptance, and clinical staff acceptance. Contractor Requirements: The contractor shall provide adequate and appropriate staff, equipment, supplies, and space facilities necessary for carrying out the requirements of this procurement.  The study design issues relevant to easy collection and exporting of the data shall be done with appropriate consultation with other BCSC experts and national experts on related research.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of current experiment in progress.  Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound is the only source known to the NCI that offers this unique type of service and is uniquely qualified to conduct this evaluation because it is a member of the BCSC; has a computer-based tablet system that allows automated completion and collection of accurate data elements which can be kept confidential and accessible to those who need it; has a data system infrastructure with pre-populated patient information; and has a long history of using data to both assist with clinical care and facilitate reminders to women due for mammograms.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; written quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. OCC-HQ-03-01234 is being issued as a Request for Quote.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-11, January 2003.  The National American Industry Classification System Code is 721110 with a corresponding size standard of $6M. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to award up to three (3) blanket purchase agreements to hotels in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. The OCC is a non-appropriated Federal financial regulatory bureau of the U. S. Department of the Treasury with approximately 2850 permanent employees in 100 cities nationwide and London, England.  The OCC is headquartered in Washington, DC with primary locations in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The OCC has a requirement for up to 50 sleeping rooms in the event that the agency determines a need to relocate critical staff for continuation of operations of the OCC.  The hotel shall be compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq, (Public Law 101-391), and must hold a FEMA certification number.  The hotel shall be compliant with Americans w/Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq (ADA); The hotel shall have one of the following quality ratings:  First class or higher per the Official Hotel Guide; Three crowns or higher per the OAG Business Travel Planner; three diamonds or higher per AAA; or Two stars or higher per the Mobil Travel Guide.  A pet friendly property is desirable, but it is not a mandatory requirement.  The room rates shall be at the prevailing government per diem in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is estimated that these rooms will be required for a period of 30 or more days, but there is no guarantee of a minimum or maximum number of sleeping room nights.  These BPA’s may be exercised at the discretion of the OCC for numerous reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following:  imminent terrorist threat or actual attack against the Federal government; imminent terrorist threat or actual attack against the OCC; Federal mandate or notice from the President of the United States to relocate critical staff; national implementation of code orange or red alert status; natural disaster or Acts of God that directly affect the OCC Headquarters; etc.  These BPA’s could be exercised by the OCC with minimal or no advanced notice to the primary property.  The primary property shall provide all the sleeping rooms that it can, up to the estimate of 50 sleeping rooms, and would work with the OCC to find other local properties to meet the immediate need if it could not meet the full requirement.  The primary property shall allow travelers not initially housed in the primary property the opportunity to relocate to that property as soon as additional rooms became available.  The primary property also shall make arrangements with the other local properties to have the sleeping rooms master-billed through the primary property for those individual travelers not initially located in the primary property. Sleeping room charges and any applicable local taxes will be master-billed on a monthly basis and individual travelers will be responsible for any incidental charges.  Payment for the master billed sleeping rooms will be in the form of the Government Purchase Card after an itemized bill has been produced by the primary property showing the names of the travelers, date of arrival, date of departure, and total charges.  Terms of the Prompt Payment Act will apply for these transactions. These BPA’s will be from time of award to September 30, 2003 with four one-year renewal option periods. Options will be automatically exercised unless government advises in writing 30 days prior to start of option period that option will not be exercised. The primary property will establish a single point of contact and an alternate point of contact for the BPA.  The OCC will establish a primary point of contact and two alternate points of contact.  The OCC and the primary property will have regular contact (telephone, e-mail, or other correspondence, etc.) with each other throughout each fiscal year that the BPA is in place.  This will be to ensure that the OCC and the primary property are continuously aware of the BPA and that, in the event the option is exercised, both parties are assured of successful operation of the agreement. For purposes of this BPA, the primary property and the OCC will use the OCC’s local Charlotte, North Carolina address as the primary address for the OCC for purposes of billing, etc.  That address is: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 6100 Fairview Road, Suite 1154, Charlotte, North Carolina 28210.

<DESC>COHERENT COMMUNICATIONS, IMAGING AND TARGETING (CCIT), Phase II, SOL RA03-08, POC Dr. L.N. Durvasula, DARPA/TTO; Fax: (703) 696-2204, Contractual POC: Ms. Algeria K. Tate, Fax: (703) 248-8033 Website: http://www.darpa.mil.  E-Mail: RA03-08@darpa.mil.  The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is seeking sources to provide innovative concepts and technology demonstrations for high speed and high resolution silicon micro-machined spatial light modulators (SLMs) with integrated high speed electronic drivers for addressing the SLM pixels and signal processing algorithms to provide digital control of the phase of optical wave fronts.  This new capability to provide digitally controlled flexible optical wave-front surfaces is critical to aberration free ground to space secure laser communications and sensing and three-dimensional imaging of objects at very long ranges in excess of 1000 kilometers.  This will enable aberration free ground to space coherent communications, imaging and targeting at very long ranges.  Robustness, reliability, and high response rate will depend heavily on scalable architectures and intermediate demonstrations.  BACKGROUND:  In order to establish the feasibility of technology to develop high speed and high resolution SLMs with integrated, high speed electronic drivers for addressing the SLM pixels and signal processing algorithms to provide digital control of the phase of optical wave fronts a solicitation requesting proposals for Phase I effort was published on 28 June 2000 in Commerce Business Daily (CBD) under COHERENT COMMUNICATIONS, IMAGING AND TARGETING (CCIT) SOL RA00-35.  Phase I requirements were to develop multiple design approaches and demonstrations of SLMs with a 32x32-element unit cell scalable to 1024x1024 elements, a pixel flatness of one fiftieth of a wavelength and eight bits of phase resolution per pixel with integrated electronics.  A maximized pixel size with a high fill factor in excess of 98 percent and a response time of 10 microseconds to provide a frame rate of 10 kilohertz and piston motion of half the wavelength at 1550 nanometers was required for preliminary demonstrations of aberration free communications, imaging and targeting in excess of 1 kilometer.  A team comprised of national laboratories, not for profit research laboratories, industry and universities were selected to develop innovative concepts and technologies for, and conduct preliminary demonstrations and systems application analysis.  Additional tasks were added to demonstrate plus or minus 10 degrees deflection or tip-tilt movement for the SLM pixels independent of piston movement.  Phase II calls for full-scale demonstrations of 1024x1024 SLMs with enhanced performance of the technologies developed in Phase I and demonstrations of one or more applications at ranges in excess of 10 kilometers.  OBJECTIVES:  The objective of this Phase II solicitation is a 24-month effort to demonstrate the high resolution and high speed capability of 1024x1024 pixel SLMs with integrated high speed electronic drivers for addressing the SLM pixels and signal processing algorithms to provide digital control of the phase of optical wave fronts.  The goal is that each pixel of the SLM will have: 1) a maximized size with a high fill factor in excess of 98 percent, 2) a response time of 10 microseconds to provide a frame rate of 100 kilohertz for each pixel, 3) a pixel flatness of two hundredth of a wavelength at the operating wavelength, and a surface roughness of two nanometers across a pixel, 4) eight bits of phase resolution per pixel for the stroke or piston movement of each pixel on the order of five micrometers, 5) a pixel deflection or tip-tilt motion of  plus or minus 10 degrees with ten bits of resolution or deflection steps with near diffraction limited performance for full array and sub-arrays of pixels, 6) integrated electronics to address each pixel.  The stroke or piston movement and pixel deflection or tip-tilt motion must be independently controlled and establish how these key parameters relate to one another in the design of a SLM system, so that they can be extrapolated to develop a design for specific applications.  Ground to air or mountain top demonstrations of either aberration free multi-gigabit secure communications and/or three-dimensional imaging at horizontal ranges in excess of 10 kilometers will be conducted using the full-scale SLMs to establish the feasibility for ground to space demonstrations of secure multi-gigabit communications and aberration free three-dimensional imaging.  Emphasis will be placed on integrated approaches, i.e., integrated teams formed to better address the many different technological and scientific aspects of the CCIT, Phase II, program.  Teaming is strongly encouraged among organizations with core competencies that are complementary.  To facilitate further information exchange between potential bidders and program objectives, an Industry Day Briefing will be provided on Tuesday, April 22, 2003 from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM at Booz Allen Hamilton, Suite 600, 3811 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement to establish and implement a Clinical Studies Consortium. One award is anticipated. The Clinical Studies Consortium will be one of three components of an Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Immunization Network that will be created via contract awards in mid fiscal year 2004. The Network will have three components: a Clinical Studies Consortium, an Animal Studies Consortium, and a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center. Each component will be established under separate contracts. Subcontracting will be encouraged. The purpose of the Clinical Studies Consortium is to develop and implement a plan to eliminate the risk for eczema vaccinatum in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients who are immunized with vaccinia. The Consortium will perform clinical studies on AD patients to evaluate innate and adaptive immune responses. These studies should provide important information about immune abnormalities that account for susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum, and should facilitate future design of safer and more effective vaccines for AD patients. The tasks that the Clinical Studies Consortium must fulfill will be coordinated with the Animal Studies Consortium and the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center. In their capability statement, organizations capable of fulfilling this effort, at a minimum, must demonstrate capabilities to: 1) Establish a Clinical Studies Consortium consisting of institutions capable of providing the clinical, scientific, technical and administrative expertise necessary to perform clinical studies in patients with AD; 2) Manage an organizational plan that must include processes for: a) establishing research priorities; b) reviewing, modifying, approving and disapproving research studies; c) allocating resources; d) monitoring and evaluating progress and performance; e) redirecting scientific focus and reallocating resources; and f) establishing and maintaining effective working relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and with other NIAID-supported programs on biodefense and relevant non-biodefense research; 3) Propose a governance plan for the Network Executive Committee and chair and participate in this committee, which will be the governing body of the Network for all three components; 4) Design and implement safe protocols that assess immune function and gene expression in atopic dermatitis patients, both in vivo and in vitro, in response to: a) a defined set of antigens; and b) immunization with selected attenuated viruses; 5) Obtain and store blood and tissue samples from atopic dermatitis patients; 6) Identify atopic dermatitis patients with documented disseminated vaccinia and/or disseminated herpes simplex and/or severe molluscum contagiosum infection, for recruitment in a Registry; 7) Provide appropriate resources critical to clinical, scientific, technical and administrative support in a cost-effective manner. 8) Ensure an orderly transition of contract-related activities and materials to a successor Contractor or the Government at contract completion. It is anticipated that the period of performance for the contracts will be five (5) years, beginning approximately February 17, 2004.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-04-06 will be available electronically on or about April 18, 2003 and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract, and will be posted on FedBizOpps.  Receipt of proposals will be due on or about July 28, 2003.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The United States Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), requires a research-grade flame/graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS/GFAAS) system including: autosampler units for both flame and graphite furnace, Windows 2000 compatible computer system controller with operating software and printer, burner head for nitrous oxide, components to power and operate both hollow cathode and electrodeless discharge type lamps, graphite tubes, hollow cathode lamps (calcium, magnesium, sodium,  potassium, zinc, and aluminum), electrodeless discharge lamps (arsenic, cadmium, lead, selenium, and zinc) and set-up [Solid State laser (750 nm)] for accurately defining light scatter distribution versus angle and 116 channel signal separation.  The system will be used in a small EPA analytical  laboratory to analyze total and dissolved cation and heavy metal elements in surface water, soil extract, and biological tissue samples to support several different research studies. Space restrictions in the laboratory require the system have maximum allowable dimensions are 152 cm (60 in.) L x  65 cm (26 in.) H x 176 cm (30 in.) D, excluding external autosamplers, computer controller, and printer(unless they must also occupy the available bench area). The available space must accommodate both the flame and graphite furnace components. To maintain required throughput and analytical  demands, the system must utilize no fewer than a five (5) lamp array to permit at least Five (5) different elements to be analyzed during a single analytical run, utilizing either the flame or graphite furnace, and compatible with both hollow cathode lamps (HCL) and electrodeless discharge lamps  (EDL). A double-beam configuration is required. The system must be computer controlled for automatic recognition, and have the capability to adjust lamp current by computer control. The system must include HCL lamps for calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, aluminum, and zinc analysis and EDL  lamps for zinc, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and selenium analysis.  The offered system must be fully integratable with the existing automated dilution system (Perkin-Elmer AutoPrep 50). An autosampler is required for both the flame AAS module and the graphite furnace capable of dispensing a range from  1 to 99 microliters in one (1) microliter increments.  The U.S. EPA believes that only Perkin-Elmer can produce an instrument that can meet these requirements.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this requirement may submit technical  documentation to establish its assertion. The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 10 days of the electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA. Information  received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>We are currently soliciting for an Automotive Prime Vendor Worldwide to replace SP070098D9901 (APVO), expiring 5-26-03.  The solicitation was delayed due to changes in contracting method/clauses from the past buy.  Issuance occurred on 3-31-03 with closing projected 12 May 03.  Estimated award date for the new contract is first quarter FY04; therefore, we are extending the current contract (9901) for six-months due to the urgency of requirements, in accordance with FAR 6.302-2.  The estimated volume/value for the extension is 15,190 orders and $2,075,761.28 based on the past six month history for the –9901 contract.

Expiration of this contract before the successor is in place would cause a disruption in work processes; i.e., generating hundreds of PRs for Non-NSN (CAGE and P/N) and Non stocked NSNs to DSCC buyers that are currently handled by the APVO contract.   The supplies are urgently required to maintain continuity of supplies during wartime and the using services' military capability will be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to extend the existing contract by six months.  

	The requisitions going to this contract consist of all IPG categories, with many IPG Is, special 9XX project codes, NORS/E and expedite shipments for all Services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (GSA-FTS) is issuing this sources sought notification in search of vendors that hold GSA Federal Supply Schedules that would allow them to perform services described herein.  This project is for the Naval Air Depot located at Cherry Point, NC.   GSA FTS is only interested in vendors who hold a GSA FSS Schedule.

The project will consist of designing, developing, documenting and testing software corrections and enhancements to existing aircraft systems, primarily the Control Display Navigation Unit (CDNU), the Interface Shipset (ISS) and lab simulator.  Project may require a rehost of the existing CDNU software. These systems are MIL-STD-1553B based.  The CDNU encompasses several platforms, including C-130 and CH-46, while the ISS is C-130 exclusive.  

Vendors are needed to perform all tasks necessary to produce specified Project from supplied GFI.  Vendors will be required to perform software design in the ADA coding language for the CDNU; Assembly Language for the ISS; C++ for the lab simulator;  in accordance with best commercial practice.  It is preferable that vendors be CMM Level 3 certified but not required.  Vendors will also be required to update the current windows based lab simulator(s),  and pertinent documentation to incorporate the project corrections and / or enhancements.   

The CDNU operates on the 1553B data bus as either a bus controller (BC) or a remote terminal / backup bus controller (RT / BBC).  Each CDNU has the resources to completely operate the Communication-Navigation Management System (CNMS) and associated systems.  The CDNU that is functioning as the BC performs all navigation computations, builds all page displays, communicates with all associated equipment, and performs all other computations required to support CNMS and associated systems operation.  The RT / BBC CDNU(s) serve as spare BCs and process keystrokes, display pages built by the BC CDNU, and perform continuous built-in-testing (BIT) with all free processor time.  If more than one CDNU is installed then each provides simultaneous and independent operation.  For example one CDNU can be used to display system status while another is used to edit the flight plan.  Also, one CDNU can scroll through the flight plan while the other is used to edit the flight plan.  The only exception is that system annunciations are displayed on all CDNUs simultaneously.

The ISS acts as a bridge between the CDNU on the 1553B data bus and the navigation and communication systems that communicate to the ISS over discrete, synchro, analog, and serial interfaces.  The ISS monitors the health of itself and each of its interfaces and reports its status to the CDNU.  ISS software is responsible for acquiring data from it’s analog, synchro and discrete inputs and making the data available on the 1553B data bus, obtaining data from the 1553B data bus, converting it to the appropriate ISS unit output signals / controls and returning the status of the commands, performing as an RT on the 1553B data bus, and performing BIT as required.  

If you feel your company meets the criteria and can perform these requirement(s), please email a request for project details edgar.ruffin@gsa.gov, by April 15, 2003.  Please include a copy of your GSA Schedule and location information along with your request.

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI):  United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Cape Canaveral, Florida, is soliciting sources capable of providing the requirements described herein.  This acquisition is in support of USA’s prime contract NAS9-20000 - Space Flight Operations Contract (SFOC) with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technical Requirements Description:  Perform engineering and professional services for the designing, recommending and performing an overall system reliability analysis that demonstrates system reliability levels for the Oxygen Deficiency Monitoring System (ODMS).	The existing ODMS is comprised of seventy-four (74) separate locations (all within Kennedy Space Center (KSC)) ranging from launch pads to Mobile Launch Platforms (MLP) to rooms within buildings.  Each system monitors from 1 to 4 separate areas or zones within each location, and each system is comprised of 3 major sub-systems.  Each system is comprised of 3 major sub-systems:  the actual oxygen monitoring device, the system supervisor and the battery backup for the amber trouble beacons.  All 3 sub-systems are interconnected to provide a stand-alone area monitoring for a deficient atmosphere. The overall project is comprised of 2 phases.  Phase 1 consists of 2 parts.  In Phase 1, Part 1, the subcontractor will perform engineering and professional services to upgrade, modify and/or replace the ODMS at KSC to increase system reliability and reduce calibration frequency.  The scope of work includes:  design ODMS, evaluate alternative solutions and perform system reliability analysis.  In Phase 1, Part 2 (optional), the subcontractor will provide assistance to the USA project team in the technical evaluation of proposals submitted by potential vendors for implementation of the replacement ODMS.  Phase 2 is the implementation of Phase 1 requirements (TBD - this phase is currently being defined). Reliability, safety and minimal flow interruptions must be implemented into the final project results.  The engineering services products must be completely met to provide for a fully implemented and integrated system for turn-key operations. Procurement Strategy:  USA is responsible for the overall program management and integration of these technical requirements.  USA will solicit the participation of qualified sources and sources desiring to participate on a limited basis will also be considered.  USA reserves the right to issue a single/sole source subcontract.  The period of performance and technical requirements are currently being defined for inclusion into a formal RFP package.  This procurement is a renewal requirement currently being performed by an existing subcontractor.  The new requirement will have an effective start date of May 1, 2003.  USA anticipates the issuance of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) within 30 days of release of this RFI.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes, and the objective is:  (1) to invite potential sources to submit information that allows USA to conduct a technical assessment of capabilities and qualifications, and (2) to promote a best value competition.  This preliminary information does not constitute an RFP, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by USA to enter into a subcontract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.	  Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications:  USA invites potential sources to submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document that will allow USA to conduct an assessment of capabilities and qualifications.	The Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document shall be no more than five (5) pages (8.5” x 11”) in length.  The required information shall include, but not be limited to:  (1) A brief description of your company, including its size, major products, and primary customer focus, (2) A discussion of your company’s past experience and performance in developing/performing the requirements described herein, and (3) A brief description of your company’s facilities, assets and any other available resources. Past experience will be identified by a listing of all related contracts and subcontracts, along with a description of your company’s performance under these contracts and subcontracts.  If any of these contracts and subcontracts are Government related, provide the Contracting Officer’s name and telephone number in order for USA to validate your statements.  To be considered as a viable source, USA will evaluate the Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications by considering, but not limited to, the following criteria:  (1) Depth and relevance of experience and past performance history, which convey a demonstrated technical, cost, schedule ability; (2) An understanding of the technical requirements and risks associated with this requirement; and (3) The adequacy and availability of necessary facilities and resources for implementing and performing the contractual work. USA reserves the right to request supplemental information in order to clarify your company’s capabilities and qualifications.  Only offerors deemed to be best qualified, or have a reasonable chance for award, will receive the RFP.

<DESC>This is NOT a presolicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5, but is a Market Survey to identify sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, facilities, and experience necessary to meet the Air Force requirements necessary to develop a Hazardous Material Prime Vendor Logistics Support capability that will streamline the supply chain and improve support to all ALC customers. The Air Force Material Command (AFMC) Air Logistics Center’s (ALC) authorize, order, stock and consume a large volume of hazardous materials (HazMat) in support of preplanned depot maintenance activities, depot commodity production, and other base or tenant requirements.  Due to the multitude of vendors, purchasing systems, storage methods, and delivery systems, excessive delays are frequently experienced at various points in the HazMat supply chain that have a negative impact on mission support at the ALCs. This announcement is to identify interested vendors, state-of-the-art technologies, and commercial practices that will assist in our endeavor to develop a prime vendor who will assume these logistics support responsibilities and activities in an effort to streamline the supply chain to improve support to all ALC customers.  The types of hazardous commodities included under this program are defined in FED-STD-313D.  All stock classes listed in Table I and some of the stock classes listed in Table II (as to be determined by the government) of FED-STD-313D shall be included in the Prime Vendor Support Program. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this survey.  A Draft Requirements Description and a Contractor Capability Survey are available in FedBizOpps.  The extent of foreign participation or level of security clearances required to receive a solicitation has not yet been determined.  Therefore, participation in this survey may not necessarily result in your company being able to participate in the solicitation.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements may be advantageous.  Responses to this survey are due prior to close of business Friday, 02 May 02.  If additional information is needed, contact Tom Robertson at 478-926-6726.
