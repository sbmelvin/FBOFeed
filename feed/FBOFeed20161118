<DESC>PEAK POLICY AND NEXT GENERATION INVENTORY MODEL <br />EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS
<p><br />Written response is required.</p>
<p>Anticipated Award Date: On or before 21 Dec 16.</p>
<p>Duration of Contract Period: Less than one year; approximately 10 months.</p>
<p>This will be a Time-and-Materials contract.</p>
<p>Electronic procedures are approved for this acquisition.</p>
<p>Description: The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541611, which has a corresponding Size Standard of $15 Million.</p>
<p>The specific requirement for this effort is found below.</p>
<p>PEAK POLICY AND NEXT GENERATION INVENTORY MODEL <br />EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Potential sources must be able to run, execute, modify, and analyze Peak Policy and Next Generation (NextGen) Inventory Model for Air Force reparable items. Traditional methods for managing items with infrequent or highly variable demand often suffer from extremely high forecast error, and, as a result, generate excess inventory and poor customer service. The Air Force is pursuing the development and implementation of advanced analyses and inventory management methods that specifically address these challenging demand patterns, based on optimization and risk management techniques, not forecasting. The methods enable a three-way trade-off among customer wait time, inventory value, and procurement and repair workload, providing a more optimal solution to meet business objectives. These advanced methods are mathematically intensive and require a modeling and simulation capability to simulate performance using randomized and historical replay based on five or more years of demand history, as well as dynamic levels updates. Peak Policy and NextGen are computational methodologies that were developed by Logistics Management Institute (LMI), and the algorithms and associated computer code are LMI intellectual property and business proprietary information. Peak Policy and NextGen are in use by the Defense Logistics Agency for consumable items, and an initial analysis of Peak Policy and NextGen for Air Force reparable items was funded by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration, DASD(SCI), from the Spring of 2014 to the Spring of 2016. DASD(SCI) funding of Peak Policy and NextGen for Air Force-managed reparable items has ceased, and the Air Force plans to continue Peak Policy and NextGen analysis efforts. The Air Force requires the services of subject matter experts to further analyze, test, and refine Peak Policy and NextGen methodologies for highly variable and sporadic demand items to improve the Air Force's inventory performance. The ability to run, execute, modify, and analyze Peak Policy and NextGen is a required level of support that is non-negotiable. The Air Force does not have access to Peak Policy or NextGen algorithms and computer code, and potential sources must provide these methodologies on day one of the performance period. The Air Force will provide demand and basic item management data to potential sources, but all Peak Policy and NextGen algorithms, code, and supporting software must be provided by the contractor. This requirement is not for the development of information technology (IT) capability. <br /><br />This requirement is considered sustainment and does not allow for development or modernization of a contractor's IT capability. This requirement does not allow for the Government purchase of software modifications or software enhancements. This requirement does not allow for the Government purchase of computer hardware. This requirement does not allow access to Government servers. At time of proposal, the contractor shall have a complete IT capability that has the ability to perform the requirements as stated above.</p>
<p>Service/Spare/Repair/OH: Service.</p>
<p>Application: Multiple weapon systems.</p>
<p>Destination: Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma</p>

<p>Quantity: 10 Lots</p>
<p>Mandatory Language:</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is to modify existing contract for additional services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Logistics Management Institute (LMI), CAGE 2D675, located in McLean, Virginia, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation for this additional work. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received by the closing date of this pre-solicitation announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273.</p>

<DESC>Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or after December 7, 2016 for the procurement of Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Trend Analysis and Anomaly Resolution System/WSOMS Mediated Interoperability Infrastructure (WSTARS/WMII). This requirement is for hardware, systems/software engineering, integration, logistics, training, and technical support for WSTARS/WMII subsystem. The deployment of the WSTARS/WMII will provide management capabilities of both the terrestrial and satellite networks from designated Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOCs) and Management sites. The WSOCs are located at Landstuhl, Germany (LOC), Wahiawa, Hawaii (WOC), and Fort Buckner, Okinawa, Japan (BOC), Fort Detrick (DOC) and Fort Meade (MOC), Maryland. WSTARS/WMII also shall provide decision support analysis and automation for the resolution of unknown anomalies. This base contract will be for the development of a proof of concept/developmental system, software development, integration, logistics, installation, testing and post production support. . The solicitation number is W52P1J-17-R-0008. The acquisition is required by Program Manager Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems (PM WESS), Project Officer Wideband Controls (PO WC) within Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise Information Systems (EIS).
<p>The WSTARS/WMII will be the component of the WSOMS that will provide enhanced data sharing and information management capability while focusing on expanding the trend analysis and anomaly resolution capability. The vision for the WSTARS end-state is a subsystem that replaces the existing Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Integrated Management System (DIMS), automates many of the routine satellite resource allocation and configuration functions for managers, and removes many of the routine "operator-in-the-loop" functions of controllers. WSTARS will, in the future, alleviate much of the status reporting from the operator as this function becomes increasingly automated. WSTARS will support management of Wideband Commercial SATCOM and Wideband Military Satellite Communications systems and be accessible to all levels of the wideband SATCOM Community of Interest (COI). WSTARS will be installed at the Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOC) and other WSOMS support sites noted in the WSOMS Capability Product Document (CPD) Increment 2 (Draft). The WSOMS Network (WSOMSNET) is the network that connects the WSOMSNET nodes such as WSOCs and WSOMS support sites. WMII will be the common computing infrastructure which hosts WSTARS software, databases, and all other applicable subsystem software in a VM environment and provide communication via Web Services/Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Bus. WMII will serve as the interface to other WSOMS subsystems and other external users.</p>
<p>WSTARS/WMII will modernize the management of the WSOMS System-of-Systems by synergizing the communications and data between sub-systems and utilizing current Information Technology standards. Enhancement upon the communication and data collaboration by performing data analysis will provide the Warfighter with increased awareness of assigned duties.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be conducted using competitive negotiation procedures and the best value trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1. ACC-RI intends to one (1) contract that meet North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334220 (size standard is 1,250 employees). This RFP will result in a single award of a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as defined in FAR 16.504(a). Contract line items may be procured utilizing Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) or Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF). The Government intends to make one (1) award.</p>
<p>All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM). If you are not registered in SAM, you cannot be awarded a DOD contract. The internet site for registering in SAM is http://www.sam.gov. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.5, 5.102 and 15.201; therefore, hardcopies will not be provided. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov .</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.</p>
<p align="left">No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/pre-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-17-055 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Propel Labs, Inc. located at 345 East Mountain Avenue, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80524.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92, dated November 18, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 811310 with size standard of $7.5 Million Dollars.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, specifically the results of market research concluded that only Propel Labs Inc. is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement for the purposes of continuity of science and equipment compatibility. Specifically, Propel Labs, Inc., in coordination with Coherent Laser Company, is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the instruments requiring service and the instruments are proprietary to this company. Propel Labs, Inc. and Coherent Laser Company authorize only Propel Labs, Inc. to perform maintenance and repair services for the equipment;. Coherent Laser Company will not perform maintenance and repair services for the instruments and no contractor other than Propel Labs, Inc. is authorized or capable of providing manufacturer approved parts, software updates, and service technician labor. For reference, please see the attached sole source letter from Propel Labs.</p>
<p>Use of any other contractor than Propel Labs, therefore, would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully operational to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of longitudinal research data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the National Institute on Aging mission, and the work of multiple individual principal investigators. Accordingly, only Propel Labs, Inc. is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

<div style="display: inline !important;"><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong></div>
</strong>This is a combined synopsis/pre-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br /><br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-17-056 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to BD Biosciences located at 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92, dated November 18, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 811310 with size standard of $7.5 Million Dollars.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that only BD Biosciences is capable of providing the necessary support services.

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this requirement on the basis of best value, technical factors and price considered. Technical factors together shall be considered more important than price and all technical evaluation factors are detailed below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Factor 1: Technical Approach</span></p>
<p>The contractor shall detail in its technical proposal how it shall meet each of the project requirements. This shall include the maintenance provision approach, including discussion of whom shall perform the maintenance support, the replacement parts which shall be available, and expected response times. Technical approach shall be evaluated for speed of response, brand of parts available, and certification of service technicians.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Factor 2: Past Performance</span></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a list of two (2) contracts or purchase orders completed during the past five (5) years, similar in size and scope to the maintenance requirements outlined in this Statement of Work. Experience must be specific to provision of laboratory instrument maintenance and shall include the following information for each contract or purchase order listed:<br /><br />a.	Name of Contracting Organization<br />b.	Total Contract Value<br />c.	Description of Requirement <br />d. 	Contract Period of Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated for relevance to the current requirement.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excellent</span><br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good</span><br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acceptable</span><br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marginal</span><br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unacceptable</span><br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

<p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Nonetheless, submitters should properly mark their responses if the information is confidential or proprietary. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission other than acknowledgment of receipt, should the submitter request an acknowledgement. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The mission of the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN) is to coordinate federally sponsored analytical laboratory services for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents. The ICLN does this through planning, identifying resources, providing laboratory surge capacity support, and defining key process steps for information exchange and data sharing during an incident. During CBRN incidents, the ICLN provides timely, credible, and interpretable data in support of surveillance, early detection, and effective consequence management.</p>
<p>To support the interoperability of laboratory networks, the ICLN created Data Exchange Utility (DEU), which is a secure online system that supports the exchange of laboratory results data in an agreed-upon standardized ICLN format. The DEU is web-based application to facilitate the aggregation of data from multiple laboratory networks working jointly to resolve a major incident involving a number of samples that would overwhelm a single network. The DEU is also designed to be a data repository for laboratory results.</p>
<p>The ICLN also developed the Combined Registry (CR), which is a secure database that houses the Methods Registry, network proficiency testing data and schedules, and the training calendar.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE OF THIS RFI</p>
<p>The ICLN is interested in collecting market research information regarding maintenance and support of the ICLN Data Exchange Utility and Combined Registry. Vendors and organizations with services are invited to provide a response regarding the ability to maintain and support the DEU and CR, which includes, but is not limited to, the following components:</p>
<p>Maintain the integrity of the Data Exchange Utility and the Combined Registry in use on the ICLN Portal, identifying and repairing any alterations that may occur due to use in the production space or to changes in the production space (i.e. the Portal environment).</p>
<p>Manage the data and support data mapping.</p>
<p>Support periodic data exchange testing and re-mapping.</p>
<p>Manage the system terminology through the user interface and through the back-end database.</p>
<p>Conduct a formal review of the data exchange utility and combined registry to ensure that all changes have been captured.</p>
<p>Support network validation. Confirm network mapping to Minimum Data Element (MDE), upload, and download testing, incident creation, mapping corrections, technical assistance.</p>
<p>Provide technical support for exercises during the planning, execution and after action of exercises.</p>
<p>Provide technical support for real world incidents when the ICLN has been activated. During real world incidents, troubleshoot mappings, support participants, support query and analysis of data, and trouble shoot system performance as needed.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to exercise Option Period One under Contract VA118-16-C-1218 in support of the Office of Research and Development Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center for brand name Datalabs software maintenance.  This effort is in support of two Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) clinical trials:  CSP 594 and CSP 597.  This contract was awarded on July 29, 2016 to Datalabs Inc., University Research Park, 101 Academy Drive Suite 250, Irvine, CA  92617 on the basis of other than full and open competition pursuant to authority 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 entitled,  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition prior to award of this contract is attached.
Due to Government oversight, Option Period 1 was not exercised on or prior to October 01, 2016, which was the Government s intent.  The period of performance for Option Period 1 was from October 01, 2016 through June 30, 2017.  The purpose of this announcement is to notify industry of the Government s intent to exercise Option Period 1 via bilateral modification of contract VA118-16-C-1218 with Datalabs, Inc. notwithstanding the Government s inadvertent failure to exercise the option in a timely manner.  The foundation of this approach to modify contract VA118-16-C-1218, as opposed to conducting a new procurement, is that only Datalabs, Inc. can provide the required Datalabs software maintenance (regardless of the acquisition strategy utilized).  
Any vendor wishing to dispute the Government s intent to exercise Option Period 1 shall provide detailed rationale to Keiahna Brewer, Contract Specialist, Keiahna.Brewer@va.gov and Robert C. Kately, Contracting Officer, Robert.Kately@va.gov no later than November 28 2016 at 10AM EST.

<DESC><p>Industry Request for Information <br />KC-135 Multi-Function Display (MFD-255K)</p>
<p>CAUTION:</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the repair data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to produce and repair the KC-135 Pacer Crag Multi-Function Display (MFD) National Stock Number 5841-01-504-5586CW, part number (P/N) 822-1006-201. Potential sources must possess the ability to provide fully functional MFD(s) meeting C-135 specifications &amp; requirements.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition strategy is a one year engineering services contract tentatively beginning in FY17 through FY18 depending on funding approval. The proposed services are required to refresh the MFD-255K and expected to provide the 407th with a long-term sustainable and affordable solution to support the KC-135 platform.</p>
<p>The MFD-255K works within the WXR-700X Color Weather Radar System which is a solid state airborne X-band radar with its receiver-transmitter (RT) operating at 9.33GHz. The RT generates high energy transmit pulses and receives reflected return signals from precipitation, ground terrain, or aircraft (skin paint) targets depending upon the mode of operation selected. Receive circuits process the return signals into MFD-255K display. In addition to normal weather detection, the RT can detect turbulence and wind shear events. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511.The Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMC/AMSC) is 3/P: Items screened and found to be procured from the actual manufacturer or vendor, including a prime contractor who is the actual manufacturer. Rights to use data legally unavailable. The government has inadequate data. The Government does not own or have access to the data for this item. The Government has determined that this system is a commercial item. Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or price lists or commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply.</p>
<p>There are no samples available for potential suppliers to evaluate. If necessary, potential contractors shall furnish all material, support equipment, tools, test equipment, and services needed to fill this order. The contractor is responsible for providing, maintaining, and calibrating all support equipment required at their facility or a subcontractor's facility. Contractor furnished material or parts used for replacement shall equal or exceed the quality of the original material or parts and meet counterfeit prevention plan guidelines as outlined in Data Item Description (DID) DI-MISC-81832.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates being in a sole source environment for the KC-135 Multi-Function Display (MFD-255K) refresh to correct obsolescence issues related to the LCD display module. These services shall include labor and supervision needed to develop and flight test a refreshed MFD-255K. These engineering services will also require the contractor to verify form, fit, function and integration of the refreshed MFD, provide top-level drawings and prototypes for flight testing. The MFD is a commercial item and therefore the data is proprietary to Rockwell Collins (RC) Inc. The proposed contract action is for supplies and/or services for which the Government does not have in its possession the data or rights thereof to perform this effort. The Government anticipates that these services can only be obtained through the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities. This notice of intent is "NOT" a request for competitive proposals. All potential offerors should contact the Program Manager (PM) identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this effort.</p>
<p>Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. The following company has been identified as the OEM for this asset:</p>
<p>ROCKWELL COLLINS, INC.<br />GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS<br />CAGE Code: 13499<br />400 COLLINS RD NE<br />CEDAR RAPIDS IA 52498-0505</p>
<p>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.</p>
<p>As prescribed in 15.209(c), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)</p>
<p>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of market research in an effort to overcome barriers to competition.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The document(s) below contain a description of the KC-135 Multi-Function Display (MFD-255K) requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey. The Survey allows Contractors to provide their company's capability.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />a. Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business.</p>
<p>3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>4. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to the PM.</p>

<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>PdM EO/IR is conducting market research to ascertain if there are any changes in the market place for sustainment support to suite of EO/IR Sensors, specifically sensors provided by L-3 WESCAM and known as the MX series of sensor systems (MX-10, 15, 20 &amp; 25) that have been previously integrated, qualified and tested on distinct Army platforms currently fielded and in support of units operating worldwide. The Government plans to award a ceiling increase to its existing sustainment support contract previously awarded to Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) on behalf of L-3 Wescam Inc (in accordance with Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 225.870-1(c)). That contract was not competed per authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1-Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Government is not currently able to procure the rights to the technical data required to support the MX Sensor Systems. The work covered by the basic contract and the additional work to be obtained by the proposed ceiling increase is the same scope of efforts. The increase is due to three factors. First, there has been continued and in some cases increases in Other Contingency Operations (OCO) worldwide in which MX Sensor Systems are in direct support. Second, this action accounts for Operational Need Statements (ONS) and other urgent requirements for MX Sensors Systems or services in the FY16/17 timeframe in support of direct theater requirements where the Soldiers and/or field commanders identified specific MX Sensor requirements to meet the emergent threat. Lastly, a portion of this action will be providing sustainment support to increases in the number of MX Sensors entering the Army inventory as qualified second source sensor supporting an Army platform.</p>
<p>This effort will include procurement of new MX sensors to supports ONS requests and sustainment support to these existing MX Sensors in the Army's inventory. Specifically the support includes; delivery of up to 10 replacement sensor systems per year to replace battle damaged units, upgrade/modification to address obsolescence and sustainment support to include repair parts, maintenance, special test equipment, field service representatives (FSRs) and Training. The Government is interested in approaches, facilities, resources, contractual relationships and other capabilities that may contribute to improved value to the Government (cost, schedule, and performance) in the sustainment of these existing series of sensor systems (MX-10, 15, 20 &amp; 25).</p>

<p>&bull; AMSAA JTCG/ME is concerned with 1) the description and vulnerability of enemy targets to various damage mechanisms associated with conventional weapons such as fragments, blast, conical shaped charges, linear shaped charges, self forging fragments, armor piercing projectiles, high explosive projectiles and others and 2) weapon system effectiveness analysis including: methodology, computer simulation, data analyses, model verification and validation, documentation of models, systems effectiveness analyses and data base management systems.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT<br />The U.S. Army Material Support Analysis Activity (AMSAA) Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) is a joint service group whose mission is to provide the Services effectiveness data for fielded non nuclear munitions. The U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) supports the Army and the JTCG/ME with studies on the effectiveness of both fielded and developmental munitions.

JTCG/ME is charged with establishing standardized procedures for important test factors such, as kill criteria, weapon lethalities, delivery accuracies, methodologies and data format for reporting new munitions effects into JMEM's. Weapon effectiveness calculations require a number of inputs such as weapon characteristics, weapon delivery accuracy and target vulnerability to specific damage mechanisms.</p>
<p>The objective of the proposed procurement is to obtain support in the areas of target descriptions, target vulnerability analysis, target survivability analysis, weapon system effectiveness and performance, data analysis, target disablement evaluation, component damage, warhead lethality, threat modeling, vulnerability/lethality methodology development and other areas.</p>

<SUBJECT>Potential Supply Chain Management, Customer Direct Contract for T64 Engine Consumables
<SOLNBR>SPE4AX17RWXYZ
<RESPDATE>120216
<CONTACT>Ingrid V Smith, Phone 8042985275, Email Ingrid.Smith@dla.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research and to gauge potential interest in this anticipated support program. The Government seeks information that will be used as part of an analysis to determine if responsible sources exist to designate this effort as a competitive acquisition. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in responses from all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government. Under this potential supply chain management contract, a contractor will carry out logistics functions for the T64 Engine platform. DLA Aviation at Richmond anticipates possible award, on a sole-source basis, of a contract for the acquisition of supply chain management support and logistics management, which may include supply support on a customer direct basis, demand/planning forecasting, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage/warehousing, reliability improvements, and field customer service/engineering support of the T64 Engine manufactured by General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines and the associated T64 Bill of Materials (BOM) of DLA managed consumable parts to support United States Navy (USN), Marine Corp (USMC) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.</p>
<p>The overarching objectives of this acquisition are to: (1) decrease T64 Engine repair delays due to outstanding consumable requirements, and fill requisitions within material availability priorities; (2) accelerate the Fleet Readiness Center East (FRC-E) whole engine repair turnaround time through enhanced material availability and cross-talk between USN Repair of Repairable and FRC-E concurrent repairs; and (3) improve field level engine support and reduce overall maintenance costs by preventing engine removal actions through the insertion of contractor-provided Technical Service Representatives at the major east and west coast operation sites. In order to meet these objectives, the contractor must have the ability to drive changes into the weapons system configuration and, more importantly, understand, analyze, and assess the implications-both in terms of performance and operational usage-of any potential configuration change.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to aggregate all material requirements in order to leverage the best value for material support. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies via Customer Direct terms/delivery points as directed within specified timeframes. The contractor shall be responsible for forecasting, acquiring, stocking, and fulfilling requirements via its commercial operation/facility utilized to meet contract requirements. In addition to filling material requirements, the contractor is required to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) along with being responsible for obsolescence management and mitigating Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) challenges for the T64 Bill of Materials (BOM).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the material support approach will include using DLA as the primary source of supply for material during transition of any resulting contract and seeking DLA stock depletion with contractor "turn-on" of material supply once DLA assets are depleted. As this will vary for each item within the BOM, an integrated solution, dedicated program management team will be required to ensure material availability and zero degradation of support.</p>
<p>Performance metrics associated with this acquisition may be tied to local (FRC customers) and DLA (worldwide) material availability. Small business participation and reliability improvements are also potential metrics.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for an expansion of support based on developing and evolving T64 Engine requirements from DLA and/or USN/USMC.</p>
<p>Any entity interested/able to provide any of the required products but cannot provide the required supply chain management solution may be afforded an opportunity to partner with an interested prime contractor, or participate as a subcontractor. Please identify any anticipated teaming arrangements under the acquisition herein, along with a description of similar support and teaming arrangements offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Entities seeking to become an approved source of supply for possible subcontracting opportunities under this acquisition should note that the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. Sources that are not approved for manufacture of these items must obtain source approval from the Government.</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information in your response: Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Point of Contact, Phone, Email and web page URL if available. Also please describe what small business type or category you represent, if applicable.</p>
<p>Any responses to this Potential Sources Sought should include responses to the following:</p>
<p>1. Describe your experience executing relevant supply chain management programs. What do you envision as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate those risks?</p>
<p>2. Is your interest in this effort as a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>3. Describe your capabilities in performing the supply chain functions: demand forecasting, supplier management, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/maintaining reliability.</p>
<p>4. Describe the transition and implementation actions and timeframes your firm would identify/need to successfully execute the anticipated requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>5. What quality control systems/measures do you currently have in place (ISO 9000, 9001, AS9100, NADCAP (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program)?</p>
<p>6. Describe your experience with Government Source Inspection, Critical Safety Items, and OSHA standards.</p>
<p>7. How many employees are in your company?</p>
<p>8. Are you currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)? Do you currently have access to any Government systems, authorized for use in performance of another Government contract? If so, please explain.</p>
<p>9. What suggestions, if any, do you have for this potential supply chain management customer direct contract (including evaluation criteria, CLIN structure, contract structure, incentive/disincentive structure and application, data requirements, or other elements)?</p>
<p>10. Do you possess all the necessary technical data to perform this potential contract?</p>
<p>11. Do you have electronic interface capability with military inventory control points?</p>
<p>12. Describe your experience with ECPs and obsolescence and modeling/simulation capabilities for Engine platforms, and if applicable, specific experience with the T64? <br /><br />Disclaimer</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT (PSS) OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This PSS is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this PSS that is marked Proprietary or competition sensitive will be handled accordingly. Responses to the PSS will not be returned. The responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this PSS. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this PSS. <br /><br />Interested sources should contact DLA Aviation by December 2, 2016 for further information. Inquiries should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Ingrid Smith, DLA Aviation - ARCJ, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, VA 23297.</p>

<p><br />APPENDIX 1: Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>Conduct Swedish Remedy Exercise Model training focused on the mind-set, assessments, and treatments needed to provide lifesaving interventions at the point of injury, and timely, well integrated evacuation from the field of battle. Training will not relying solely on supplies or support. This training will be conducted through the use of highly trained live role players, cut suits, and world-class special effects makeup artists. All of these facets are integrated through the crawl-walk-run methodology, giving the chance to gain skill and decrease stress when faced with complicated and often dangerous medical and tactical problems. Scenarios are provided that challenge both skill and the perception of skill making possible the realization what is truly possible in uncertain and unknown situations. Medical Threat Mitigation adds the challenges, which may be face outside of a developed theatre or in an emerging theatre. Focusing on resource management and non-traditional scenario training.</p>
<p>This training will take place on 06-10 FEB 2017. On 05FEB2017, Bravo Company medical personnel will move to Fort Bragg Combat Training Center and prepare to conduct training. On 06FEB2017 medical personnel will receive training which includes: Intravenous anesthesia/non-traditional anesthesia options; supply management; charting; patient comfort and nursing care skills; use of TELECON and VIDEOCON consult; safe site selection requirements; re-supply issues; use of indigenous resource.<br /><br />The following specified services and supporting materials are required to satisfy mission-critical training requirements during the proposed event, sustained extended care of a combat casualty in the midst of a long range evacuation due to unavailability of standard MEDEVAC assets.</p>
<p>A. Facilities</p>
<p>i. Secure facilities that provide state-of-the-art classrooms IOT enhance the below-listed instruction for the 12 PAX scheduled to attend.<br /><br />ii. A dining facility to provide students with meals during classroom training, and a field meal plan to sustain the participants during the practical exercises and CULEX.</p>
<p>iii. Extensive training areas and structures used to facilitate multiple extended real-world safe house and austere MEDEVAC scenario practical exercises as well as a vigorous CULEX with the below-listed requirements.<br />a. Patient role players with the capability of giving realistic feedback commensurate with the moulaged wounding patterns and remain in role for 48-72 hours.<br />b. Exercise controllers (must have level of training equal to or above Special Operations Combat Medic) to evaluate each SOF provider with a written after action review (AAR) of each medical encounter.<br />c. Rotary wing, fixed wing, ground and waterborne assets capable of facilitating multiple SOF providers and patient transport.</p>
<p>iv. Training areas and structures must not present any unnecessary safety hazards or major obstacles impeding the completion of the course within the stated schedule (06-10FEB2017). If thoroughfares (foot paths or roads) are present within training area, the contractor must make arrangements to ensure they are free of traffic during training exercises, unless OPFOR/civilians and their vehicles are included in the exercise.</p>
<p>v. Training areas/structures must support the presence of an on-site medical evacuation vehicle (within 200 meters) of training exercise in the event of a real-world injury. Medical evacuation routes must not be impeded during training.</p>
<p>vi. Training location must support immediate communication with emergency services including fire, flood, and medical responders. Points of contact for each of these services must be maintained at the training site.</p>
<p>B. Instructional materials and range support</p>
<p>i. Medical supplies shall be procured by the contractor. Medical supplies will be labeled with accuracy proportionate to the exercise scenario (i.e. proper labeling for 1st world medical supplies; less than standard labeling for medical supplies indigenous to a 3rd world combat theatre)</p>
<p>ii. Contractor proprietary medical materials (i.e. manuals, charts, or logs) to be used throughout the course should be provided and/or loaned to trainees without additional costs. Required specialty equipment outside of normal requirements should be identified to 5/19th SFG(A) prior to traveling.</p>
<p>C. Instruction</p>
<p>i. The cost per individual trainee will is for the duration of training (for a class size of 12 trainees). Instruction is expected to continue through the duration for a minimum of a five day course.</p>
<p>ii. Instruction requirements are focused on developing the advanced medical skillset needed to manage a critical patient in a hostile, resource-poor environment, over a long term/long distance evacuation. Particular areas of interest are intravenous anesthesia/non-traditional anesthesia options, medical supply management, charting, patient comfort and nursing care skills, use of TELECON and VIDEOCON consult, safe-site selection requirements, re-supply issues, and use of indigenous resources. The construction of temporary hide sites and the use of local vegetation in camouflage should be an included factor in training.</p>
<p>iii. Instruction should address subjects such as medical threats in 2nd/3rd world environments, low-visibility medical supply, non-linear evacuation concerns, mission-specific aid bag packing, and Force on Force medical scenarios.</p>
<p>iv. Instruction is expected to focus on being able to conduct these operations in a Non-Permissive environment (NPE). Enemy OPFOR and civilian role players with personal agendas that factor into the training scenarios will be essential to creating a realistic environment.</p>
<p>v. The CULEX should be extensive (72 hours or more), involve multiple hide sights/ safe houses over a considerable distance, and engage the participants with the most difficult aspects of an NPE. At the core of the CULEX should be scenarios with unpredictable developments requiring the participants to critically think on the move and adapt (i.e. a shortage of medical supplies requires them to somehow acquire the supplies on the local indigenous market, or from local non-medical sources). The scenario should progressively increase in difficulty, and allow participant choices to affect the status of patient/scenario conditions.</p>
<p><br />D. Expectations from trainees</p>
<p>i. Trainees will report to the Fort Bragg Combat Training Center, Maxton NC facility NLT 0900 (local time) on 06 FEB 2017 and are expected to complete training no later than 2359 (local time) on 10 FEB 2017.</p>
<p>ii. Trainees will report with all individual equipment including clothing, ammunition, rifles, classroom supplies, and required medical kit.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background:<br />Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. NIAID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and support Phase I/II clinical studies. While the overall suite of services provided is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway.</p>
<p>NIAID anticipates awarding a single IDIQ contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this solicitation. Sample Task Orders are provided in the RFP solely to evaluate offeror responses and capabilities. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Parent Contract.</p>

The information collected through this process is determined to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002. This is NOT a Request for Quotes (RFQ), and nothing shall be construed herein or through the Sources Sought process to commit or obligate the Government to further action. In addition, vendors responding to this notice shall bear all risks and expenses of any resources used to provide the requested information. The submission of capability information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary.<br /><br />The Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to identify qualified and responsible small business vendors (e.g., 8(a); Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business; Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business; Small Disadvantaged Business; Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business)having an interest in and possess the resources to provide support for the National Institute of Justice and assist in the execution of its extramural and intramural research, evaluation, research and development, forensic, demonstration and international programs. Further the Contractor will assist NIJ in managing logistics and program support for all phases of NIJ programs and initiatives. The scope of NIJ's activity includes strategic planning activities and other program development initiatives. The Government intends to issue a Time &amp; Materials contract for these services. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to these proposed services is 541330.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /><br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has a requirement for professional Scientific, Engineering, and Technical Assistance (SETA) support services to assist in its mission to enhance the U.S. criminal justice systems and strengthen investigative and forensic science practice by developing knowledge and tools to reduce crime and promote justice, particularly at the state and local levels. <br />The skills requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) demonstrate the depth and breadth of disciplines required for the SETA support services contract. The specialized experience called for in the position descriptions span the entire investigative and forensic science portfolio, including but not limited to: Chemistry; Biochemistry; Polymer Chemistry; Drug Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Materials Science; Physics; Applied Physics; Optics; Chemical Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Systems Engineering; Biology; Genetics; Population Genetics; Microbiology; Biochemical Engineering; Environmental Biology; Molecular Biology; Systems Biology; Plant Biology; Anatomy; Anthropology; Toxicology; Medical Science; State &amp; Local Government Technology Policy; Technical Risk Assessment; Technology Performance and Reliability; Product Testing and Evaluation; Product Development; Database Development; and Software Engineering.<br /><strong><br />Scope<br /></strong><br />The scope of this SOW relates primarily to scientific and technical support services. NIJ funds the development of, and provides deployment assistance for, investigative and forensic science technologies. The contractor must have significant experience providing professional scientific, engineering and technical support services to Federal agencies or other entities. While previous experience does not have to be directly related to forensic science, the scientific areas should be translatable to the areas that will be supported by this SOW, which are primarily in the following program areas:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIVE AND FORENSIC SCIENCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mission of the Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences (OIFS) is to improve the quality and practice of forensic science through innovative solutions that support research and development, testing and evaluation, technology, information exchange and the development of training resources for the criminal justice community. The OIFS' efforts to accomplish this mission are aligned with the Department's mission, OJP's policies, the NIJ's strategic planning, and Congressional appropriations. The OIFS Director reports to the NIJ Director through the Principal Deputy Director. The OIFS Director oversees seven major programmatic portfolios: Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program Office; Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office; DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office; Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Program Office; Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program Office; Missing Persons Program Office; and Cold Cases Program Office. These programs will change as new programs are added and current programs are ended. The OIFS Director is also supported by federal staff that provides expert technical and program management advice and a quality review of each program's planning and performance. The OIFS Director will also integrate and coordinate activities amongst the programs, the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence, the National Commission on Forensic Science, Organization of Scientific Area Committees and other DOJ offices and Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program <br /></span></strong>The goals of the Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program Office are to expand the information that can be extracted from traditional types of forensic evidence, and quantify its evidentiary value; to develop reliable and widely applicable tools and technologies that allow faster, cheaper and/or less labor-intensive identification, collection, preservation and analysis of forensic evidence; and to strengthen the scientific basis of the forensic science disciplines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program will achieve these goals by investing in research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and analysis efforts that will increase knowledge and produce fieldable technologies. Breakthroughs in these areas will create new technologies for use in forensic science laboratories and increase knowledge to support the underlying scientific basis of fielded technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program's technology portfolio focuses on multiple areas that include but are not limited to: Forensic Biology (e.g., DNA analysis, RNA analysis, protein analysis, etc.); Forensic Chemistry (drug chemistry, elemental analysis of trace evidence, chemical analysis of evidence resulting from fires/explosives, etc.); Forensic Anthropology (mass disaster victim identification, medicolegal death investigation, identification of missing persons, etc.); Forensic Pathology (toxicological analysis, medicolegal death investigation, etc.); Imaging and Microscopy (analysis and comparison of impression and pattern evidence, microscopic morphological examination of trace evidence, etc.); Spectroscopy/Spectrometry (crime scene investigation, trace materials and chemical analysis, etc.); Forensic Science Laboratory Methods (instrumental analyses, assay development, etc.); and Forensic Science Data Analysis (development of software, statistical methods, databases, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</strong></span> <br />The goal of the Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office is to increase the pool of researchers who are involved in providing STEM-based solutions to problems that affect criminal justice policy and practice in the United States. Through the GRF-STEM program, NIJ supports STEM graduate education by investing in academic institutions that support outstanding and promising doctoral students. The program will achieve this goal by competitively awarding fellowship grants to graduate students who are enrolled full-time in doctoral degree programs in STEM disciplines at eligible academic institutions; and have proposed dissertation research topics that are relevant to providing solutions to problems that directly affect public safety, crime, and/or the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program</strong></span> <br />The goals of the DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office are to assist eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA and/or DNA database samples, and to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis. The program will achieve these goals by providing financial assistance in the form of grants and cooperative agreements to States and units of local government with existing accredited crime laboratories that conduct forensic DNA and/or DNA database sample analysis with the ability to upload data to the National DNA Index System (NDIS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program</span></strong> <br />The goals of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program Office are to (1) carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner services in the State, including those services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the State; (2) eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect to firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned documents, and trace evidence; and (3) train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel as needed to eliminate such a backlog. The program will achieve these goals by providing both formula and competitive grant awards to States to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner services, including services provided by laboratories operated by States and/or units of local government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program<br /></span></strong>The goal of the Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program Office is to assist States and units of local government with post-conviction DNA testing in cases of violent felony offenses where actual innocence might be demonstrated. The program will achieve these goals by competitively awarding grants to States, units of local government, and public institutions of higher education to assist in defraying the costs associated with post-conviction case review, evidence location, and DNA testing in violent felony cases where the results of such testing might show actual innocence.<br />Missing Persons Program <br />The goals of the Missing Persons Program are to facilitate the association of unidentified human remains with known reference samples. The program will achieve these goals in two ways: (1) through the Using DNA Technology to Identify the Missing Program which provides financial assistance to States, units of local government, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, institutions of higher education, and certain qualified individuals to perform DNA analysis on unidentified human remains and family reference samples to support the efforts of States and units of local government to identify missing persons, and (2) by supporting the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Program which is a national centralized repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified decedent records. NamUs is a free online system that can be searched by medical examiners, coroners, law enforcement officials and the general public from all over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cold Cases Program</span></strong> <br />The goal of the Cold Cases Program is to utilize advances in DNA technology to facilitate the successful resolution of cold cases. The program will achieve these goals by providing assistance to States and units of local government to identify, review, and investigate Uniform Crime Report Part 1 Violent Crime "cold cases" that have the potential to be solved through DNA analysis, and to locate and analyze biological evidence associated with these cases.</p>

<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The mission of the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN) is to coordinate federally sponsored analytical laboratory services for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents. The ICLN does this through planning, identifying resources, providing laboratory surge capacity support, and defining key process steps for information exchange and data sharing during an incident. During CBRN incidents, the ICLN provides timely, credible, and interpretable data in support of surveillance, early detection, and effective consequence management.</p>
<p>To support the interoperability of laboratory networks, the ICLN created Data Exchange Utility (DEU), which is a secure online system that supports the exchange of laboratory results data in an agreed-upon standardized ICLN format. The DEU is web-based application to facilitate the aggregation of data from multiple laboratory networks working jointly to resolve a major incident involving a number of samples that would overwhelm a single network. The DEU is also designed to be a data repository for laboratory results.</p>
<p>The ICLN also developed the Combined Registry (CR), which is a secure database that houses the Methods Registry, network proficiency testing data and schedules, and the training calendar.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE OF THIS RFI</p>
<p>The ICLN is interested in collecting market research information regarding maintenance and support of the ICLN Data Exchange Utility and Combined Registry. Vendors and organizations with services are invited to provide a response regarding the ability to maintain and support the DEU and CR, which includes, but is not limited to, the following components:</p>
<p>Maintain the integrity of the Data Exchange Utility and the Combined Registry in use on the ICLN Portal, identifying and repairing any alterations that may occur due to use in the production space or to changes in the production space (i.e. the Portal environment).</p>
<p>Manage the data and support data mapping.</p>
<p>Support periodic data exchange testing and re-mapping.</p>
<p>Manage the system terminology through the user interface and through the back-end database.</p>
<p>Conduct a formal review of the data exchange utility and combined registry to ensure that all changes have been captured.</p>
<p>Support network validation. Confirm network mapping to Minimum Data Element (MDE), upload, and download testing, incident creation, mapping corrections, technical assistance.</p>
<p>Provide technical support for exercises during the planning, execution and after action of exercises.</p>
<p>Provide technical support for real world incidents when the ICLN has been activated. During real world incidents, troubleshoot mappings, support participants, support query and analysis of data, and trouble shoot system performance as needed.</p>

The US Geological Survey (USGS) Hosting Services team is seeking an annual software maintenance package that provides connectivity with USGS storage systems hardware providing true incremental backup to tape via USGS Andrew File System (AFS) connected file servers.   

The USGS Hosting Services NatWeb system currently utilizes a replicated Open Andrew File
System (AFS) installation with multiple file servers attached to Storage Area Network devices at
multiple locations. AFS provides all file system and web content support for all virtual hosts
using the NatWeb system, which includes approximately 150 web sites.  NatWeb -- the USGS infrastructure for web services -- utilizes OpenAFS for file replication between its three sites in Menlo Park, Reston, and Sioux Falls.  Content is required to replicate every 15 minutes such that each site can serve the exact same information to the public.  In order to backup content from an AFS volume, the backup software must have direct access to the corresponding AFS cell. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.  The incumbent contractor is Teradctyl LLC.  Teraactyl produces proprietary software which meets the USGS Open AFS network requirements stated above.  The USGS has been unable to identify any Teradactyl authorized resellers (or unaffiliated vendors) that can meet the requirements stated above.  Small business concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information to the Contract Specialist no later than 12PM EST, Wednesday, November 23, 2016.

Past performance information should be submitted for projects conducted within the last three years and include: project title, location, whether the work was as a prime or subcontractor, contract/subcontract dollar value, type of contract, percentage of self-performed work, and overall performance rating received. 
3.	Small business status of vendor (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.)
4.	Point of contact information for vendor and DUNS Number.
5.	Any other information that will prove the vendor is capable of performing the required effort.

Interested vendors much provide their response via email to the Contract Specialist, Chris Kuhn, ckuhn@usgs.gov with the subject line reading G17PS00071. Responses should be limited to 10 pages (single-sided). Mailed and faxed responses will not be accepted or evaluated. 

NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE-SOURCE/MODIFY CONTRACT W911W4-15-C-0003
<p><br />The United States Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN), Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), on behalf of the INSCOM Logistics (G-4), intends to modify bridge contract W911W4-15-C-0003 to extend it for up to 12-months (6-month base with a 6-month option) under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2(a)(2) - Unusual and Compelling Urgency, to:</p>
<p>CACI Inc. Federal<br />14370 Newbrook Drive<br />Chantilly, VA 20151-4206</p>
<p>Contract W911W4-15-C-0003 currently provides services for this requirement and will be extended from 28 December 2016 through 27 June 2017.</p>
<p>Contractor support will provide INSCOM G-4 with continued critical worldwide Global Logistics and Engineering support services to include, Program, System, Engineering, and Transition Management support services.</p>
<p>All personnel working this effort shall have US citizenship and a Top Secret (TS) security clearance with Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) with eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination (ICD 704), unless specifically waived by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)/Alternate COR.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: <br />Primary performance locations are:<br /><br />&bull; Camp Bullis, TX<br />&bull; Charlottesville, VA<br />&bull; Columbia<br />&bull; Fort Belvoir, VA <br />&bull; Fort Bliss, TX <br />&bull; Fort Bragg, NC<br />&bull; Fort Campbell, K<br />&bull; Fort Carson, CO<br />&bull; Fort Hood, TX<br />&bull; Fort Lewis, WA<br />&bull; Fort Meade, MD<br />&bull; Fort Riley, KS Fort Irwin, CA<br />&bull; Fort Stewart, GA<br />&bull; Germany<br />&bull; Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba<br />&bull; Hawaii<br />&bull; Korea<br />&bull; Springfield, VA<br /><br />Secondary performance locations are:<br />&bull; Fort Draper, UT Fort Drum, NY<br />&bull; Fort Gordon, GA<br />&bull; Fort Polk, LA<br />&bull; Los Alamitos, CA</p>
<p><br />This is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a current period of performance of six months from 28 June 2016 to 27 December 2016.</p>
<p>The Government awarded task order W911W4-14-D-0004-0002 under the Global Intelligence Support Services (GISS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract on 26 February 2016 to DynCorp. However, successive protests submitted under the award invoked an automatic Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay since March 2016. The CICA Stay has directly impacted performance on GISS task order (TO) W911W4-14-D-0004-0002. As a result, a bridge modification is required to the current contract, W911W4-15-C-0003, to provide ACC-WRN (INSCOM) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) sufficient time to adequately address the post award protests.</p>
<p>Interested parties may express their interest and provide a capabilities statement no later than 28 November 2016 at 12:00 PM EST. A determination not to compete this proposed contract extension upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The Contractor must provide information an exact or equivalent ultrasound system as described below that has the following features:</p>
<p>a. Integrated Sherlock 3CG <sup>TM</sup> Diamond TCS technology which permits vascular access by allowing to visualize Peripherally Inserted Central Line (PICC) placements without the need for placement verification by chest X-ray, which in turn allows real-time monitoring of the cardiac function throughout the procedure.</p>
<p>b. This technology visually aligns the needle pathways, prior to insertion; visualize needle tip location in relation to the target structure. Confirm needle intersection of the ultrasound plane. Maintain image integrity by eliminating the need to move the probe to locate the needle, and place needles out-of plane, in-plane, or oblique to the target structure.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) to Siemens Energy, Inc., 1345 Ridgeland Parkway Suite 116 Alpharetta, GA 30004 for the design, equipment and installation required for replacement of medium voltage switchgear and primary unit substations. The SATOC acquisition addresses the need of multiple projects requiring essentially the same work in multiple locations throughout the electrical power system. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">AEDC has the need to procure medium voltage switchgear that is reliable and safe. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is the latest technology that provides power without requiring personnel to be equipped with arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) while operating or maintaining the GIS equipment. Hours of industry wide research, competitive bidding, and accepted maintenance and reliability practice have resulted in the conclusion that Siemens Type 8DA10 Gas Insulated Switchgear is the only switchgear that confines each of the three phases of power in three separate compartments. This is a critical requirement from a safety standpoint and mitigates electrical fault severity to avoid costly shutdowns of the entire system. With the isolation of the phases a factory-trained Siemens employee can remove the damaged phase and replace it with the identical part from a spare cubicle, and return the cubicle to service in a short amount of time. In most cases this work can be completed with the remainder of the switchgear lineup still in service. If spares are available, a new enclosure could be installed from the spare cubicle but the entire lineup would be unavailable throughout the duration of the repair.</span></p>

<DESC><br />The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Management Services/Contracts (CON) located at 330 Independence Ave, SW., Washington, D.C. 20237, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Mr. Wassim Abdulla, P.O. Box 2000 Ramallah, Palestine. The Contractor is currently providing the services that this action covers. The Contractor shall provide operation, maintenance and technical support of the BBG transmission and monitoring services for BBG's twenty four (24) hours uninterrupted Frequency Modulation (FM) broadcast services throughout Palestine, West Bank and Gaza. The Contractor possesses the capabilities to provide the services necessary for BBG to accomplish its broadcasting transmission throughout Palestine. This contract award will include a one (1) year base period with four (4) option periods. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(1) which is implemented at FAR 6.302-1 as follows: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." The nature of the proposed sole source award requires these unique services and supplies to be provided by Mr. Wassim Abdulla in order for BBG to continue the 24-hour uninterrupted BBG Radio Sawa broadcasts in Palestine. Over the past several years, the Contractor has installed the BBG FM stations in Contractor leased facilities and the Contractor has also obtained the frequency licenses required to broadcast in the region. Any attempt to relocate the transmission equipment to another site or to use another Contractor would result in an interruption of Radio Sawa and there would be considerable cost to the Government. BBG could not identify any additional potential sources beyond Mr. Wassim Abdulla who can meet BBG's requirement. It has been determined that Mr. Abdulla is the only known Contractor to BBG who is capable of and authorized to continue the uninterrupted 24-hour FM BBG Radio Sawa transmission in Palestine. See attached agency justification. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive price proposals. Interested firms must submit a written response that demonstrates their ability to provide the above. Also, interested firms must state how they would fulfill the requirement above and include appropriate documentation describing the number of years they have been providing such services. The written response received from interested firms shall provide sufficient detail to allow for an evaluation by the Government without the need for the submission of additional information. The written response must be submitted to Seneca Belinfontie, Contract Specialist, by Friday, December 2, 2016, 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time via email at <a href="mailto:sbelinfo@VOANews.com">sbelinfo@VOANews.com</a>.

<DESC><br />The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Management Services/Contracts (CON) located at 330 Independence Ave, SW., Washington, D.C. 20237, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Ibrahim Al Hajaj, P.O. Box 901991, Jebel Alhusain, 35 Ibnsina St. Amman, Jordan. The Contractor is currently providing the services this action covers. The planned sole source award will allow the Contractor to continue to provide the BBG operational, maintenance and technical support throughout the Middle East and Arabic speaking North Africa. The Contractor possesses the capabilities to provide the services necessary for the BBG to meet its broadcasting mission in the Middle East and Arabic speaking North Africa. This contract award will include a one (1) year base period with four (4) option periods. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(1) which is implemented at FAR 6.302-1 as follows: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." BBG is currently operating twenty six (26) radio stations and five (5) television (TV) stations in Iraq, which are of critical importance to the mission of BBG. The Contractor's services are urgently needed by BBG in order to keep the above stations on the air to ensure continued BBG broadcasting and to preserve its audience in Iraq. The situation in the Middle East is volatile and with this award BBG will be able to continue to provide programming to the region. In the event that this award is not executed and the above stations will go off the air, and BBG will lose the broadcasting infrastructure that is already in place. If BBG were to lose this broadcasting infrastructure in the Middle East, it would be very costly and require additional expenditure for related services for BBG to re-establish the lost infrastructure. In addition, BBG would lose the audience that it has already established and BBG may not get that audience back. It is important that BBG have a broadcasting apparatus within the Middle East as it is a critical part of the BBG broadcast mission to broadcast in the Middle East. This broadcasting infrastructure took more than five (5) years to develop and without this award it will be lost.<br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive price proposals. Interested firms must submit a written response that demonstrates their ability to provide the above. Also, interested firms must state how they would fulfill the requirement above and include appropriate documentation describing the number of years they have been providing such services.

<a href="mailto:Jeff.Martin@ferc.gov">Jeff.Martin@ferc.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issues this Notice of Intent to acquire open market items under a GSA task order on a sole source basis.  On August 26, 2016, the FERC awarded a GSA task order in response to the Request for Quotation (RFQ) # FERC-16-Q-0049 for an Emergency Notification System.  The solicitation was competed under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 70 - General Purpose Commercial Information Technology.  The resulting task order was competitively awarded to SWN Communications Inc. under GSA Contract # GS-35F-0639P to provide a commercial software application that supported critical communications and information flow for a wide range of emergency and non-emergency incidents and events.  Examples of the information that the tool disseminates includes: Continuity of Operations (COOP), facility disruptions or closures due to mechanical issues or protests, sensitive or critical information technology disruptions, hazardous weather notifications, shelter in place, or any other possible situation or scenario where rapid delivery of essential information is critical.  
Open market functionality has since been identified as an additional requirement not included in the base award.  This open market functionality includes:

-	 Single Sign-on;

-	Self-Registration; &

-	Desktop Alerting. 

These open market items are incidental and ancillary to the overall acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 8.402(f), this posting serves as public notice of the Government's intent to modify task order # FERC-16-F-0122, under GSA FSS Contract # GS-35F-0639 to incorporate the aforementioned open market items. The open market items are necessary for the successful performance of the requirements under the task order, and the inclusion of these open market items under the task order best satisfies the needs of the Government. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), it is the Government's intent to incorporate these open market items on a sole source basis into the existing GSA task order.  

This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation for competitive quotes, and this notice in no way obligates the Government to modify the existing GSA task order, or to award a new purchase order for the open market items. Any interested vendors are encouraged to provide capability statements and associated pricing by 10:00 AM, November 28, 2016.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 with the U.S. Department of Energy, is offering the opportunity to collaborate to further develop and commercialize a new low-cost autonomous sense and avoidance system. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Background: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Autonomous systems operate in the air, on land, and even underwater. Sensing and avoiding objects is a critical necessity for autonomous vehicles when navigating their environment. Detecting objects in a vehicle's path and rapidly computing changes to the vehicle's trajectory requires object detection, path optimization, and vehicle guidance. Current solutions to this problem using optics can be limited to daylight applications, require significant system resources, and suffer in low-light or foul weather environments. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Description:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">LLNL has invented a new, robust system that enables autonomous systems to sense and avoid obstacles using lightweight, low-cost, low-power and non-interfering sensors and a computationally-efficient control system. LLNL's technology generates a computationally efficient 3D topology around the autonomous vehicle and maps the optimal path through it without classical imaging. LLNL's method works with radar, laser, or acoustic systems capable of providing a range and bearing to a contact. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The technology could be integrated with flight planning software (workstation based) as well as embedded flight controllers (on a drone) for trajectory optimization and execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unmanned vehicle operators can use the new system to detect objects during operations and to generate a reusable 3D aerial map of contacts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Advantages:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">LLNL's sense-and-avoid technology offers performance advantages over costlier imaging-based systems in:</span></p>

<SUBJECT>U--ACES 2016 Conference Sponsorship - Notice of Intent to Award
<SOLNBR>G17PS00072
<CONTACT>Kuhn, Christopher
<DESC>The USGS has a requirement for a firm-fixed price purchase order to the University of Florida Leadership and Education Foundation (UFLEF), a not-for-profit administrated by the University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) and follows the IFAS mission to develop knowledge in agriculture, human and natural resources, and to make that knowledge available to people to sustain and enhance their quality of life.  The purchase order is for sponsorship of the 2016 "A Community on Ecosystem Services" (ACES) conference, which is managed and organized by UFLEF.  The sponsorship provides the USGS with an 8'x8' display booth to feature its programs and resources to conference attendees. In addition to the booth, USGS will receive four (4) conference registrations.     

Period of Performance will be as follows: 12/05/2016 through 12/09/2016 

The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award to UFLEF unless it is contacted by any who believes they have obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service. Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Chris Kuhn, via email at ckuhn@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EDT, Wednesday, November 23, 2016 with an affirmative answer. 

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained. 

The ACES 2016 conference provides a unique opportunity for USGS scientists to share and obtain information on state-of-the-art ecosystem services science and practice.  There is no other conference in the US that provides the breadth and depth of ecosystem services expertise. 

The purpose of ACES 2016 is to provide a needed forum for sharing information on state 
of-the-art methods, tools, and processes related to ecosystem services and their effective use in 
decisions.  The issue of ecosystem services has become an increasingly critical factor in resource management and conservation.  These important issues require an understanding of the services provided by ecosystems and ways they can be valued and used in decision making.  ACES 2016 is the only forum to provide a needed platform for sharing information on state-of-the-art methods, tools, and processes related to ecosystem services and their effective use in decisions. 

The interdisciplinary nature of ACES will facilitate interactive discussions and networking to create and build partnerships while sharing lessons learned from the field.  The 
topic of ecosystem services is essential to the USGS and its Science Strategy, as indicated in
the October 2015 Memorandum from the Executive Office of the President directing Federal 
agencies to incorporate ecosystem services into decision making.  

The ACES 2016 Conference is a University of Florida event held on a bi-annual basis. As a University of Florida event, this event cannot be conducted by an organization other than the University of Florida.

<p>The Meltable Fuze Plug is composed of parts fabricated from Nylon-Ionomer and steel. The plastic portion of the injection molded plug, made of TPX-Ionomer 02055 BK, is designed to weaken when exposed to excessive temperatures to provide venting for 155mm projectiles. A machined and anti-corrosion-treated mild-steel washer is secured under the plug with an O-ring. The washer is necessary to support the palletized stacking of the projectiles. The packaging and marking of the Meltable Fuze Plugs shall be in accordance with Commercial Packaging as prescribed in the solicitation. The Meltable Fuze Plugs shall be separated by fiberboard separators for shipment to prevent damage to finish and threads<br /><br />The United States Government (USG) intends to satisfy the requirement by soliciting for offerors in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.203, Set-Asides for Small Business Concerns. The USG will evaluate offeror(s) proposals using a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process approach in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Offeror(s) will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on evaluation criteria outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The USG anticipates awarding up to two (2) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quanitity (IDIQ) Delivery Order Contracts with five (5) one (1) year ordering periods for FY18 through FY22. The maximum estimated ceiling value of this Contract will be $36.3 Million, with a minimum guarantee of $137,500.</p>
<p>The Meltable Fuze Plugs will be manufactured, inspected, staged (assembling of the material and preparation for transit) and delivered in accordance with a Government Technical Data Package (TDP) and applicable contract requirements. Specifications and drawings, containing distribution markings will require contractors to sign and submit Military Critical Technical Data Agreements (DD Form 2345), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), and an AMSTA-AR 1350 prior to receiving access to the TDP.</p>
<p>The estimated issue date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 05 December 2016. All interested small businesses are advised to monitor FedBIzOPS for RFP release. Funds are available for this acquisition.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for the acquisition and production for the Meltable Fuze Plugs for 155mm Insensitive Munitions Artillery Projectiles. It is issued for notification purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Point of contact for this requirement is Jason Santucci ACC-NJ bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email: Jason.santucci2.civ@mail.mil.</p>

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. (g) Invoice. (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include? (i) Name and address of the Contractor; (ii) Invoice date and number; (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number; (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered; (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading; (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered; (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent; (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule.

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?).?] Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records.

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be<br />accessed electronically at this address: https://www.acquisition.gov/far</p>
<p>52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2015)</p>
<p>1052.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS. (ALTERNATE II) (DEVIATION 2016-00001) (JAN 2016)</p>
<p>(e) Definitions.</p>
<p>******<br /><br />(2) As used in this clause, "Commercial supplier agreements" means terms and conditions customarily offered to the public by vendors of supplies or services that meet the definition of commercial item set forth in FAR 2.101 and intended to create a binding legal obligation on the end user. Commercial supplier agreements (CSA) are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, including acquisitions of commercial computer software and commercial technical data, but they may apply to any supply or service. The term applies-</p>
<p>(i) Regardless of the format or style of the document. For example, a CSA may be styled as standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service (TOS), End User License Agreement (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of an offer or quotation responding to a solicitation;</p>
<p>(ii) Regardless of the media or delivery mechanism used. For example, a CSA may be presented as one or more paper documents or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, other product delivery, registration for a service, or another transaction.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) The schedule of supplies/services.<br />(2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, Unauthorized Obligations, and Commercial Supplier Agreements - Unenforceable Clauses paragraphs of this clause,<br />(3) The clause at 52.212-5.<br />(4) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation. <br />(5) Other paragraphs of this clause.<br />(6) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.<br />(7) The Standard Form 1449.<br />(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.<br />(9) The specification.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any CSA, that includes any language, provision, or clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such language, provision, or clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the CSA. If the CSA is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such language, provision, or clause is deemed to be stricken from the CSA.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>(w) Commercial supplier agreements - unenforceable clauses. When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a CSA, the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the CSA. As used herein, "this agreement" means the CSA:</p>
<p>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the end user is an agency or instrumentality of the Government, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>(i) Applicability. This agreement is a part of a contract between the commercial supplier and the Government for the acquisition of the supply or service that necessitates a license (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR part 12).</p>
<p>(ii) End user. This agreement shall bind the Government as end user but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity.</p>
<p>(iii) Law and disputes. This agreement is governed by Federal law.</p>
<p>(A) Any language purporting to subject the Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or a foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted.<br />(B) Any language requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted.<br />(C) Any language prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law in relation to a dispute is hereby deleted.</p>
<p>(iv) Continued performance. If the supplier or licensor believes the Government to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(v) Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief. In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, (A) binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and (B) equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act).</p>

<p>(viii) Indemnification. Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that the U.S. Department of Justice has the sole right to represent the United States in any such action, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516.</p>
<p>(ix) Audits. Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user's compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the Government. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order.<br />(B) This charge, if disputed by the Government, will be resolved through paragraph (d) of this clause; no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the Government until the conclusion of the dispute process. <br />(C) Any audit requested by the commercial supplier or licensor will be performed at the commercial supplier's or licensor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government and must be performed within the parameters of the Government's security procedures. <br />(D) The Contractor must notify the Contracting Officer of any audit request.</p>

<p>1052.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS. (DEVIATION 00002)(JANUARY 2016)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Commercial supplier agreements" means terms and conditions customarily offered to the public by vendors of supplies or services that meet the definition of commercial item set forth in FAR 2.101 and intended to create a binding legal obligation on the end user. Commercial supplier agreements (CSA) are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, including acquisitions of commercial computer software and commercial technical data, but they may apply to any supply or service. The term applies-</p>
<p>(1) Regardless of the format or style of the document. For example, a CSA may be styled as standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service (TOS), End User License Agreement (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of an offer or quotation responding to a solicitation;<br />(2) Regardless of the media or delivery mechanism used. For example, a CSA may be presented as one or more paper documents or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, other product delivery, registration for a service, or another transaction.</p>
<p>(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any CSA, that includes any language, provision, or clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(1) Any such language, provision, or clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the CSA. If the CSA is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(3) Any such language, provision, or clause is deemed to be stricken from the CSA.</p>
<p>(c) Paragraph (b) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.</p>
<p>(b) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.</p>
<p>(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>
<p>1052.232-7003 ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS (APR 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>(1) "Payment request" means a bill, voucher, invoice, or request for contract financing payment with associated supporting documentation. The payment request must comply with the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Content of Invoices" and the applicable Payment clause included in this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests electronically using the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP). Information regarding IPP, including IPP Customer Support is available at www.ipp.gov or any successor site.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor may submit payment requests using other than IPP only when the Contracting Officer authorizes alternate procedures in writing in accordance with Treasury procedures.</p>
<p>(d) If alternate payment procedures are authorized, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer's written authorization with each payment request.</p>
<p>PAYMENT AND INVOICE QUESTIONS (IPP)</p>
<p>For payment and invoice questions, go to https://arc.publicdebt.treas.gov/ipp/fsippqrg.htm or contact Accounts Payable at (304) 480-8000 option 7 or via email at AccountsPayable@fiscal.treasury.gov.</p>
<p>OVERPAYMENTS</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-4 section (i) 5 Overpayments: Accounts Receivable Conversion of Check Payments to electronic funds transfer (EFT): If the Contractor sends the Government a check to remedy duplicate contract financing or an overpayment by the government, it will be converted into an EFT. This means the Government will copy the check and use the account information on it to electronically debit the Contractor's account for the amount of the check. The debit from the Contractor's account will usually occur within 24 hours and will be shown on the regular account statement.</p>
<p>The Contractor will not receive the original check back. The Government shall destroy the Contractor's original check, but will keep a copy of it. If the EFT cannot be processed for technical reasons, the Contractor authorizes the Government to process the copy in place of the original check.</p>
<p>MARKING OF SHIPMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the contract number is clearly visible on all shipping/service documents, containers, and invoices.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Schedule 73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective November 18, 2016  electronically. 

On June 23, 2016, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) published a General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) final rule to capture transactional data on procurements across all of its Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program contracts and Government-wide Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, to include Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). The Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the Federal Government paid for an item or service purchased through GSA acquisition vehicles.

As part of the strategic implementation of the rule across all GSA contracts, the agency will introduce the transactional data reporting requirement with a pilot of select products and services in the FSS program. This pilot was introduced in a phased approach beginning in August 2016.  

Schedule 73 is participating in the pilot program.  You will be required to submit all offers under Refresh 27 documentation effective November 18, 2016.

Why is the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) implementing this change? The goals of TDR are to:
- Significantly reduce burden to industry partners by eliminating Commercial Sales Practices (CSP) disclosure and Price Reductions clause (PRC) tracking requirements from Schedule contracts participating in the TDR pilot.
- Reduce contract administration burden for TDR pilot vendors once TDR is implemented. 
- Provide business intelligence to strengthen best value decision-making by ordering activities, which will allow customers to take full advantage of the wide variety and complexity of products and services offered by Schedule Partners and pass on savings to the taxpayer.
- Improve competition and increase transparency.
- Support category management and promote smarter buying.

With this refresh, the requirement for providing a CSP disclosure to accompany offer submissions will be eliminated. Other clauses and provisions are also being updated to implement TDR. This will result in significant burden reduction for our industry partners as outlined in the TDR Federal Register notice.  There is also a change to the content of the Price Proposal Spreadsheet in terms of MFC information required.  

Please note: For new offers received after the solicitation refresh under TDR pilot Schedules/SINs, the transactional data reporting clause and corresponding pricing disclosure changes will be mandatory for all awarded contracts.

For new contractors, reporting begins 30 days after the month in which the contract is awarded. 

GSA FAS published a public notice (Notice-FAS-2016-01) to solicit comments regarding the public release of transactional data reported in accordance with the GSAR Transactional Data Reporting clauses. GSA FAS will consider comments received in establishing its final position on which TDR data elements are releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). GSA looks forward to sharing publicly in what format intelligence gathered through TDR will be made available. 

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This solicitation includes the following product/services: FSC Group 68: Chemicals and Chemical Products; FSC Group 72: Recycling Collection Containers and Waste Receptacles; FSC Group 73: Food Service Equipment, Supplies, and Services; FSC Group 79: Cleaning Equipment, Accessories, Janitorial Supplies, Cleaning Chemicals, and Sorbents; and FSC Group 85: Toiletries, Personal Care Items, Linens, and Lodging and Hospitality Supplies and Services, and Hospitality Wear. This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. 

The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 73 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 10. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-C4-030073-B (include the dashes). 

To be the Government's leader in acquisition services, the General Services Administration (GSA) sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs.  To that end, GSA has recently awarded eighteen (18) Blanket Purchase Agreements in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) for Janitorial and Sanitation Commodities (JanSan).

In an effort to better allocate government resources and to improve our service to our customer base, GSA will temporarily postpone receipt of new offers under Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Schedule 73 for the following JanSan affected SINs: 375-100, 375-103, 375-107, 375-117, 375-125, 375-129, 375-135, 375-139, 375-200, 375-321, 375-323, 375-341, 375-351, 375-352, 375-353, 375-355, 375-356, 375-361, 375-362, 375-363, 375-364, 375-368, 375-371, 375-372, 384-2, 384-4, 384-9, 476-12, 476-13, 507-2, 507-4, 507-8, 658-1, 681-1, 852-1, 852-2 and 852-3 for the next twenty-four (24) months, effective January 16, 2015.  At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program.

Current Schedule 73 contract holders that are successfully performing and are meeting minimum sales criteria will continue to have their options exercised in accordance with I-FSS-163, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen).  There will be no change as it relates to modification requests by existing contractors.  Additionally, current successful contractors may submit a new offer as early as twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of their existing contract, regardless if the JanSan affected SINs are currently closed to new offer submission.

Therefore, GSA will be temporarily closing the JanSan affected SINs to new offers as of January 16, 2015. All offers received prior to that date will be reviewed, considered and evaluated for award as appropriate.  Offers not received by the deadline will not be considered and will be returned.  Offers will be considered on the above referenced SINs after the twenty-four (24) month postponement period has ended provided the SINs have been reopened via solicitation refresh.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject any offer which is non-compliant with the instructions reflected in SCP-FSS-001, SCP-FSS-002 and/or SCP-FSS-003 as required by the solicitation and/or is not substantially complete at the time of initial offer submission.

Urban Alliance provides year-long intern support that will meet ITCDs requirements in the area of computing administration, office administration support, IT services, data entry, creation of surveys, customer service, and tech-savvy students to help with performing research related to NASA business processes and IT industry standards. Urban Alliance provides to all their interns, program focus, student professional development training and skills training, providing the highest quality of Youth Employment services.<br />Additionally, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission require agencies to promote equal employment opportunity. Specifically, agencies shall, participate in the community level with other employers, with schools and universities and with other public and private groups in cooperative action to improve employment opportunities and community conditions that affect employability, specifically found at 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1614.102 (a) (13). By partnering with Urban Alliance NASA is able to participate at the community level with schools by using a contractor that specializes in substantially increasing opportunities for local high school students from the immediate area near NASA Headquarters, while providing meaningful work and supporting them in achieving, long-term post-high school success.<br />HQ, ITCD needs at least one year of Intern support which we find will allow the interns to obtain and put to use valuable experience gained on complex IT projects. Urban Alliance has the background that validated their ability to meet all our requirements including their programs focus, Student Professional Etiquette Preparation, Customer Service Training, and Information Technology Training for specific functions related to NASA business processes and IT Industry standards. Urban Alliance will meet all requirements thus achieving excellent NASA ratings for their performance on the current order. In addition the Interns will deliver good support and meet contractual support expectations. Other Intern programs could not meet the required timeframe of 1 year of intern support.<br />NASA's start date for this Program is November 2016 through August 2017. Other internship Organizations providing Internship Programs alters the start dates which is either less than or later than the NASA planned start date. Urban Alliance can accommodate flexibility in program start date to meet the November - August time line established and provide the identified service resources.This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<br />This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The Senior Regional Biomedical HIV Prevention Advisor will be based at the Regional HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) in USAID/Southern Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.  One of RHAP's objectives is to provide quality technical assistance to Missions that have PEPFAR programs in the southern Africa region, and as available, beyond the region.  To this end, RHAP has a cadre of high caliber Technical Advisors in the areas of Care and Treatment, OVC, Pediatric and Adolescent Care and Treatment, Nutrition, HSS/HRH, Strategic Information (SI), and Bio-Medical Prevention.  RHAP seeks to recruit a Senior Regional Bio Medical Advisor to be part of the skilled team of regional advisors that have recognized expertize in the implementation of PEPFAR programs in the region.
<p>The region that RHAP supports, Southern Africa, remains the epicenter of the global AIDS epidemic.  According to UNAIDS, in 2014 Swaziland had the highest HIV prevalence in the world at 27.7%, followed by Botswana (25.2%) and Lesotho (23.4%).  The 9 highest-prevalence countries in the world are in Southern Africa.  In the region, only Angola, at 2.4% prevalence has an HIV prevalence of less than 10%. While the rate of new infections is declining in every country, and the number of people living with HIV who are on antiretroviral treatment has increased more than 30-fold since 2004, there are still enormous challenges to reaching the goal of an AIDS Free Generation.  In 2014, an estimated 13.6 million people in the region are infected, only 46% (6.4m) of whom are on ART.  To achieve the 90-90-90 goal of 81% of PLHIV on ART by 2020, an additional 4.6m PLHIV must be put on ART in the next 5 years. The impact of HIV in the region is also compounded by a rampant tuberculosis epidemic.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, USTDA - 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600 Arlington, VA 22209, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Franklin Chalmers<br />President<br />Parque Solar Panam&aacute;, S.A.<br />Edificio Plaza Pacific, Piso 4, Oficina 13<br />Calle 66 Este, San Francisco <br />Panama City<br />PANAMA<br />Phone: + (507) 269-4004
<p><br />Panama: Arco Seco Solar Power Project Feasibility Study<br />Solicitation Number: 2016-51021A<br /><br />The Grantee (Parque Solar Panam&aacute;, S.A.) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to support the development of the Arco Seco Solar Power Project ("Project") in central Panama.</p>
<p>The Grantee is seeking to develop the Arco Seco Solar Power Project, which is expected to be among the first utility-scale solar projects in Panama.  The Project site is in one of the areas of Panama with the highest solar irradiation.  The Project would be built in four phases of 9.9 megawatts ("MW") each.</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will evaluate the technical, commercial, and environmental viability of the Project, which would allow the Grantee to move forward with obtaining financing and securing the approvals necessary for Project implementation.  The Feasibility Study includes the validation of the solar resource at the Project site, geotechnical and topographical analyses, preliminary engineering design, and preliminary environmental impact assessment, among other key tasks.  While the Feasibility Study will focus on the development of the first phase of the Project, the results will be useful for scaling the project to 39.6 MW over four phases, given the similarity of the phases.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $302,226 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA").</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:00 PM (local time in Panama City, Panama) on December 19, 2016</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

B.3  Performance Work Statement   Delivery of Liquid Nitrogen Tank(s)

A.  GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.  Title of Project:  Delivery of high quality (round-bottom) 240 liter tanks of liquid nitrogen, PSI 22, to the VA West Roxbury and Jamaica Plains research groups.  Medical grade liquid nitrogen is NOT required; 98-99% purity is the standard.

2.  Scope of Work:  The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision and all other resources required to deliver the liquid nitrogen tank(s). When called, the Contractor shall deliver the new tank(s) the next day or within two business days if there are obstacles to next day delivery. For example: if called late in the day and the Contractor does not have adequate time to load the truck for next day delivery, an extra day is acceptable.  In an emergency (insufficient liquid nitrogen remains in tank(s) for immediate needs), best efforts shall be made by the Contractor to deliver same day as ordered.  VA understands that a reasonable  emergency delivery fee  or similar charge may be incurred in the event this situation occurs.  Weekend deliveries are not anticipated but may be required and VA also understands that a reasonable  weekend delivery fee  may be incurred.  Emergency and weekend deliveries shall be kept to a minimum.

Depleted tanks will not be held at the warehouse but will be stored inside the designated areas.  At any given time there may be approximately 4-5 vendor tanks between the 3 VA specified locations utilizing this contract.

Delivery addresses:

WEST ROXBURY VA (2 Locations   2B224-03-WR  and Building 20 New Research Lab)
1400 VFW Parkway 
West Roxbury, MA   02132-4927 

JAMAICA PLAIN VA 
150 S. Huntington Ave 
Boston, MA   02130-4817

 The Contractor shall have delivery personnel who shall take the hose off the old tanks and put it on the new tank(s). The Contractor shall arrive with appropriate tools to do this.  Tanks, trucks, and drivers shall be compliant will all state and federal laws applicable to the transport and delivery of liquid nitrogen.

The tanks shall have working gauges so that the researchers can accurately tell when the tanks are low on liquid nitrogen.  All efforts will be made to avoid a situation where insufficient liquid nitrogen remains in the tank(s) for the immediate need.

The Contractor shall deliver round-bottom (more maneuverable) tanks.   Square-bottom tanks are unacceptable.

In the event the Contractor is unable to contact someone in the research department, the Contractor shall deliver the tank(s) through the warehouse at the Jamaica Plains facility and will be directed by warehouse staff to the proper location.  At the West Roxbury locations, the Contractor shall not deliver to the warehouse but shall only deliver to Room 2B224-03-WR and Building 20. (Note:  Building 20 is not anticipated to open until mid-2017.)   A listing of individuals to call upon arrival at each of the facilities will be made available by the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR).  In order that a member of the research staff is available, all deliveries shall be made in the morning between the hours of 8:00am and Noon local time.  This  morning delivery  requirement does NOT apply to emergency or weekend deliveries.  No deliveries (regular, emergency or weekend) will be accepted after 4:00pm.

3.  Federal Holidays:  For VA holidays the contractor shall contact the COR to find out if the research departments want their tank(s) before or after the holiday. West Roxbury will usually want their tanks on the Friday preceding the holiday rather than the Tuesday after the holiday.

Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day

3.  Background: The West Roxbury group will generally keep two tanks in research area 2B224-03-WR. One tank shall be delivered every Monday morning or the preceding Friday before a federal holiday. When the other tank is empty they will call the Contractor and order a new tank. If a third tank is needed they will call for this extra tank. This may happen in the summer when the tanks are used more rapidly. This extra tank shall be delivered by the Contractor as soon as possible. All empty tanks shall be removed by the Contractor upon delivery of new tank(s). If a tank has excessive venting the Contractor will replace this tank as soon as possible with no charge or penalty for exchanging the new tank for the defective tank.

The Jamaica Plains facility will keep one tank in 127-1A-JP and call and order a replacement tank when this one is empty. 

4.  Performance Period:  The anticipated contract will be a 5-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract.

B.  CONTRACT AWARD MEETING

  (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
  (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
    (1) The solicitation number;
    (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
    (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
    (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
    (5) Terms of any express warranty;
    (6) Price and any discount terms;
    (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;
    (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
    (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
    (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

Technical
Past Performance
Price
Veterans Preference Factor
  Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal.
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Evaluation Process: 
Award will be made to the best value, as determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.  Please read each section below carefully for the submittals and information required as part of the evaluation.

Verified SDVOSBs will receive a 10% price credit (e.g. if a SDVOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $90.00).
Verified VOSBs will received a 5% price credit (e.g. if a VOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $95.00).

JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME ONLY AWARD IAW FAR 13.106-1

1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA259-17-AP-1222
1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
N/A
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
[REDACTED]
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Dreamstation Apaps and Bipaps stock replenishment to support sleep centers in the VA Montana Healthcare System

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
The Respironics product and its associated EncoreAnywhere cloud-based database has become the primary product for the management of veteran s compliance on PAP. The Dreamstation Apaps and Bipaps are the only products compatible.  Furthermore, after merging the database, extensive training was provided to all sleep and telehealth staff. Introducing a different end-product would result in delays to patient care as well as a requirement for additional training, and would create a fragmented system for managing compliance among the veteran patients who are already in the system. Medical devices, assistive technologies, and adaptive equipment required for appropriate patient care are determined by a qualified clinician on a case-by-case basis and are deemed medical necessity. There may be other manufacturers/suppliers who supply similar items but do not provide for the specific fit or function of the prescribed treatment. It has been determined by the treating clinician that this specific item is the appropriate solution for the patients.

4.  SUGGESTED BRAND NAME INFORMATION:
Philips Respironics

5.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Any authorized SDVOSB distributor of the required items are considered acceptable sources.

6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
This requirement will be posted to allow for full competition amongst authorized distributors.  

7. REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATIONS: I Certify That The Requirement Outlined In This Justification Is A Bona Fide Need Of The Department Of Veterans Affairs And That The Supporting Date Under My Cognizance, Which Are Included In The Justification, Are Accurate And Complete To The Best Of My Knowledge And Belief. (Signature should be program office, service chief )

[SIGNATURE REDACTED]

8. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
 
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]

9. DOC/DDOC/DESIGNEE: I certify the justification meets requirements for other than full and open competition.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) has a requirement to convert a wide variety of Federal Government documents <strong>(beginning with Enrolled Congressional Bills, Public Laws, and Statues at Large)</strong> from GPO locator-coded text format into XML format using the U.S. Legislative Markup (USLM) schema so that GPO can make the resulting XML available as Bulk Data on the Federal Digital System (FDsys)/govinfo.<br /><br />It also seeks to convert a subset of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Federal Register (FR) from GPO SGML into XML format using the USLM schema in order to validate the USLM schema and tools in the Federal regulatory cycle and GPO's publication processes.

<DESC><p>Based on industry feedback and Government revaluation, this solicitation is being cancelled. This cancellation is due to item not meeting the definition of a commercial item. Shipping containers are available in the commercial market place. In fact many shipping containers have minor modifications to meet different commercial requirements. However, it is now known that existing shipping containers would require major modifications to meet the required specifications. These modifications would significantly alter the nongovernment function and the essential physical characteristics of the item. These modifications would also significantly alter the price of those shipping containers that are commercially available.</p>
<p>Although this solicitation is being cancelled IAW FAR 12 requirements, another solicitation will be posted for the shipping container requirement in the near future.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

<DESC><br />Solicitation Number: W15P7T-16-R-0004
<p>Classification Code: D -- Information technology services, including telecommunications services<br />NAICS Code: 334 -- Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing / 334111 -- Electronic Computer Manufacturing</p>
<p>This Amendment is to attach the Small Business Participation Plan Template, Past Performance Questionnaire, Production Assessment Survey, Equipment Production List, CHS Historical Production Data, and the Government's responses to the questions provided by industry in the previous RFI postings. The Government is no longer taking questions and comments from industry on the CHS-5 procurement at this time.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described herein. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of a contractor's submission of responses to this announcement or the Government's use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this RFI. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement and/or Performance Specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Background: The US Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC APG), MD is seeking feedback from industry concerning the planned best value trade off competitive follow-on to Contract Number W15P7T-11-D-G402 for the Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) contract. The CHS-4 contract currently provides commercial hardware [i.e. Non-Developmental, modified commercial off the shelf (COTS) items (i.e. ruggedized and militarized)] and services for the procurement of total life cycle system management solutions in support of tactical programs by providing seamless and consolidated procurement of Commercial Information Technology (CommIT), customizable sustainment strategies, non-personal services and continuous technology upgrades for a variety of military organizations utilizing Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Term and Completion Type) Delivery and Task Orders issued against a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The CHS-4 five year ordering period will expire in August 2016 with the five year warranty period for the last possible item ending in August 2021. To fully appreciate the scope and magnitude of the follow-on CHS program, the following information is provided and should be considered when responding to this RFI: Product Lead (PdL) CHS executes, on average, 125 delivery orders a year, procuring an average of approximately 60,000 items a year, at various ruggedization levels, all of which are configuration managed by the contractor. Items procured the most include: laptops, servers, routers, switches, storage appliances, operational transit cases (OTCs), displays as well as associated cables, batteries, and Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs). It should be noted that a majority of non-ancillary items are purchased with a five (5) year warranty and that end users of this equipment are located across the United States, as well as most United States (US) Army Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations - to include active theaters of operations.</p>
<p>Purpose: The Sources Sought Notice (SSN) posted on September 30, 2015 for the CHS-5 contract focused on further validating if competition existed. The responses received provided the Government additional insight into industry's concerns and helped determine a path forward for PdL CHS strategy and assisted in refining the CHS-5 contract requirements. The subsequent posting on March 22, 2016, as well as the second CHS-5 Industry Day sought to further clarify the Government's CHS-5 contract requirements.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in capturing industry's feedback regarding an optional Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty. Hardware procured with a 5-year Standard CHS-5 Hardware Warranty would also be eligible for an optional Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty of three (3) additional years. For hardware originally procured with a CHS-5 Hardware Warranty of other than a 5-year duration, the Government could still purchase an optional 3-year Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty. In such cases the Government would be required to upgrade to a 5-year Standard CHS-5 Hardware Warranty by procuring the delta between the 5-year CHS-5 Hardware Warranty and the warranty that was originally procured. The Government would be required to purchase the optional 3-year Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty (a) prior to the expiration of the 5-year Standard CHS-5 Hardware Warranty and (b) prior to the end of the CHS-5 contract ordering period. The optional 3-year Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty would be competed on the base CHS-5 contract award as a warranty option. The optional 3-year Extended CHS-5 Hardware Warranty would still require a 72-hour repair turn-around-time.<br /><br />Instructions: The Government requests respondents review the attached DRAFT solicitation for CHS-5 and provide feedback. The Government will NOT be accepting bids for CHS-5 with this posting. The Government does NOT intend to award&nbsp;CHS-5 with this posting. This is posted for informational and research purposes only. responses will be due close of business (COB) 8 August 2016.&nbsp;<br /><br />Primary Point of Contact:<br />Mr. Scott Sloan, Contract Specialist<br />Army Contracting Command - APG, Division B<br />6001 Combat Drive<br />APG, MD 21005-1846<br />scott.c.sloan.civ@mail.mil</p>

APL(S) will support up to an aircraft carrier (CVN) size ship with berthing for approximately 600 personnel and messing for approximately 1,100 personnel. APL(S) will be a non-self-propelled craft designed to be towed to bases or shipyards where ship availabilities are being conducted. Facilities on-board the APL(S) will include classrooms, conference rooms, administrative offices, disbursing office, galley, mess, scullery, post office, convenience store, barbershop, entertainment room, lounges, laundry facilities, physical fitness center, chaplain's office, medical complex, quarterdeck, equipment/machinery rooms, and various storerooms.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with 10 USC 7299a(b), before awarding work among competing shipyard offerors in a coast-wide competition, the Navy considers the reasonably predictable &amp; foreseeable "interport differential costs" of moving the vessel and its crew from the homeport to the outside place of performance and back to the homeport. These interport differential costs are added to the proposed price in order to determine each offeror's evaluated price to the government.
<p>The Navy intends to revise the interport differential calculation to further capture the cost of moving and sustaining ships force outside the ship's current homeport.</p>
<p>The Navy plans to hold an industry day on or around 30 November 2016 to discuss interport differential costs. The purpose of this Industry Day is to make the ship repair community aware of the Navy's processes and procedures utilized to develop the interport cost differentials, the constraints the Navy experiences when calculating foreseeable costs with reasonable certainty, and the revisions that are under consideration.</p>
<p>This forum will give the Navy an opportunity to receive feedback from the ship repair industry on matters relating to the calculation of the foreseeable interport differential costs.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the Industry Day, the Navy will re-examine the interport differential figures currently included in solicitation N00024-17-R-4415 and make adjustments as they Navy deems appropriate. However, the Navy does not anticipate extending the proposal due date for solicitation N00024-17-R-4415 beyond 02 December 2016. Interested parties shall be afforded an opportunity to update proposals during Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>The timing of this Industry day and the solicitation amendment will extend an offeror's right to challenge the interport differential aspect of the solicitation beyond the initial proposal submission date.</p>

<DESC>18 November 2016: The purpose of this update is to distribute DRAFT documents provided to attendees of the Industry Day held yesterday, allow opportunities for industry to ask questions regarding the solicitation requirements, and to request feedback from industry on the following:
1.  Identify significant barriers to competition and recommend ways the government could mitigate or avoid these barriers.
2.  Review the PWS and CLIN Structure and provide any questions or recommendations.
3.  What impact would an 8-yr ordering period (one base year and seven option years) have on your companys strategy for this procurement?
4.  Considering the schedule impact of performance at the contractors facility, how would you recommend the government define inspection  and  acceptance criteria that would satisfy the required turn-around-time?

The following Q and A were discussed at the industry day:
Q1	When do you plan on releasing the RFP?
A1	The planned RFP release date is currently February 2017, which will provide 2 months for proposal preparation.
	
Q2	How confident is the RFP Release Date?
A2	Fairly confident.
  The actual RFP release date may vary depending on the outcome of the review  and  approval process.
	
Q3	Are there any major changes to the requirements from the current contract?
A3	The most significant change to the requirements is the CLIN structure.
	
Q4	What business opportunities exist with FRCWP beyond the H-60 requirements?
A4	The next aircraft maintenance contract follow-on after H-60 is for F-18.  Future opportunities also exist for H-1, H-53, C-130, and V-22.
	
Q5	Is transition time included in the Base Year?
A5	Transition time will occur between October 2017 and April 2018.  Aircraft inducted during this time will be performed under the existing contract and will be performed by the incumbent at their own facility.
  Inductions after April 2018 will be performed under the follow-on contract and will be performed by the awardee.
	
Q6	How long will contractors have to review documents provided at the industry day?
A6	3 weeks, and the due date will be posted on FBO.
	
Q7	How is the current contract being worked?
A7	The incumbent contractors facilities are located immediately outside Atsugi NAF.  As such, the contract is performed in contractor-owned, contractor-operated facilities.
	
Q8	Is there any opportunity for the USG to provide facilities?
A8	Not at this time.  There may be a possibility for future requirements.
	
Q9	How are you expecting offerors to account for escalation?
A9	Offerors would be expected to build escalation / inflation into their Firm-Fixed-Price for the contract.
  The government is not considering any price redeterminations.
	
Q10	How much material will the government be providing?
A10	The government intends to provide 100% of required material; however, we can reasonably expect that situations will arise during performance that would require the contractor to procure or manufacture some material.  Such material costs would be allocable to CLIN 0004.
	
Q11	Would the USG be willing to consider awarding to a Joint Venture?
A11	The government would be willing to consider awarding to a Joint Venture.
	
Q12	If a Joint Venture were to submit an offer, how would the government evaluate past performance?
A12	Ultimately, the solicitation will decide how the government will evaluate past performance.
  However, at this time the government anticipates considering the past performance of the joint venture itself above the individual past performance of the parties involved.  If the joint venture were to not have any past performance, then the government would consider the individual past performance of each member of the joint venture.
	
Q13	Have you considered weighing Past Performance more important than Technical?
A13	We have considered this, but at this time believe that the best value to the government would best be determined by weighing Technical as more important than Past Performance.
	
Q14	How many offers were received on the current contract?
A14	One offer was received in response to the current contracts solicitation.
	
Q15	Are there any security requirements to perform this contract?
A15	The contract is unclassified and there is no DD254.
	
Q16	Could you please define what a primary subcontractor is?
A16	A primary subcontractor would be any subcontractor that receives more than 20% of the work.
	
Q17	Are there any licensing requirements for contractor employees?
A17	Individuals who perform Weight and Balance tasks are certified by Type/Model/Series IAW Technical Manual, NAVAIR 01-1B-50, USN/USMC Aircraft Weight and Balance Control, dated 01 August 2015.
 Some support equipment requires an operators license, the government will arrange training required to obtain licenses.
	
Q18	Will the government require the contractor to provide pilots?
A18	No.  The government will fly the aircraft to the contractors facility and then fly it out upon completion of the work.
	
Q19	Where would ISR events occur?
A19	Historically, most events have occurred in Guam.  ISR events may also be performed in conjunction with IMP events.  However, ISR events could potentially occur anywhere.
	
Q20	When is the awardee required to have a Proprietary Information Exchange Agreement (PIEA) with the OEM?
A20	The awardee would need a PIEA in place prior to the first induction.
  The expectation is for the PIEA to be implemented during the transition period.
	
Q21	How frequently is Over  and  Above (CLIN 0003) required?
A21	Over  and  Above (CLIN 0003) work will be required with each induction.

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED ARE DRAFT DOCUMENTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE FORMAL SOLICITATION, WHEN ISSUED, IS THE ONLY DOCUMENT THAT DECLARES THE GOVERNMENTS REQUIREMENTS.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The program will achieve these goals by investing in research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and analysis efforts that will increase knowledge and produce fieldable technologies. Breakthroughs in these areas will create new technologies for use in forensic science laboratories and increase knowledge to support the underlying scientific basis of fielded technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program's technology portfolio focuses on multiple areas that include but are not limited to: Forensic Biology (e.g., DNA analysis, RNA analysis, protein analysis, etc.); Forensic Chemistry (drug chemistry, elemental analysis of trace evidence, chemical analysis of evidence resulting from fires/explosives, etc.); Forensic Anthropology (mass disaster victim identification, medicolegal death investigation, identification of missing persons, etc.); Forensic Pathology (toxicological analysis, medicolegal death investigation, etc.); Imaging and Microscopy (analysis and comparison of impression and pattern evidence, microscopic morphological examination of trace evidence, etc.); Spectroscopy/Spectrometry (crime scene investigation, trace materials and chemical analysis, etc.); Forensic Science Laboratory Methods (instrumental analyses, assay development, etc.); and Forensic Science Data Analysis (development of software, statistical methods, databases, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</strong></span> <br />The goal of the Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office is to increase the pool of researchers who are involved in providing STEM-based solutions to problems that affect criminal justice policy and practice in the United States. Through the GRF-STEM program, NIJ supports STEM graduate education by investing in academic institutions that support outstanding and promising doctoral students. The program will achieve this goal by competitively awarding fellowship grants to graduate students who are enrolled full-time in doctoral degree programs in STEM disciplines at eligible academic institutions; and have proposed dissertation research topics that are relevant to providing solutions to problems that directly affect public safety, crime, and/or the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program</strong></span> <br />The goals of the DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office are to assist eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA and/or DNA database samples, and to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis. The program will achieve these goals by providing financial assistance in the form of grants and cooperative agreements to States and units of local government with existing accredited crime laboratories that conduct forensic DNA and/or DNA database sample analysis with the ability to upload data to the National DNA Index System (NDIS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program</span></strong> <br />The goals of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program Office are to (1) carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner services in the State, including those services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the State; (2) eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect to firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned documents, and trace evidence; and (3) train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel as needed to eliminate such a backlog.

The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 8 Apr 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>

<DESC><p>US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CO-LOCATED CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS MODULAR OFFICES NEAR SPOKANE, WASHINGTON<br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY NOTIFICATION<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for services or construction. <br /><br />The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, is considering a future solicitation for provision of a modular office complex in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington.

The complex is anticipated to provide approximately 5,000 square feet of professional office space made up of one or several modular-type facilities. The facilities will be located on the federal site licensed to the Washington Army National Guard located adjacent to the former Fort George Wright on West Government Way in Spokane, Washington. For geographic reference, this location is in close proximity to Spokane Falls Community College and the Mukogawa Institute. Provision of the office complex may include ancillary construction for water, power and sewer utilities as well as basic site improvements. <br /><br />An Industry Day will be hosted at 1:00 pm on Thursday, December 1, 2016 at Fairchild Air Force Base, WA. The meeting location is the Spokane Resident Office located on Fairchild AFB, Bldg 9010. Ms. Fillius will provide vendors/contractors with a map/directions. The purpose of the Industry Day is to allow interested vendors of modular office facilities to provide insight into available layouts, features and amenities.

<DESC>This project provides repair modernization of 1263 LF of pile supported open wharf structures originally constructed in 1943 with the intent of restoring the load carrying capacity of the portal crane rail system along the waterfront and providing corrosion protection of the wharf to allow for continued optimal usage of the facility.

Berths 11A, 11B, and 11C are actively used for submarine maintenance availabilities at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  Sections of the berths will remain in-use for the full duration of the project.  The work area is within a highly congested industrial environment and the repair effort requires detailed work sequencing requirements to avoid disruption or delays to the ongoing boat maintenance schedules.

The work includes removal and disposal of existing timber fender system, curbs, FRP catwalk and miscellaneous items; dredging; providing steel sheet pile and rock socketed king piles with concrete shutter panel bulkheads; rock anchored tie back system; providing backfill under the existing wharf; extending storm drainage discharge pipes through the bulkhead; concrete and pile jacket repairs to the existing wharf structure; providing driven steel H Piles (support piles) through existing wharf deck to strengthen existing crane rail beams; removing and reconstructing areas of existing concrete wharf deck for fill placement and support pile installation; providing a timber deck extension, deck fittings, lighting, mechanical and electrical utilities, duct bank repairs, and incidental and related work.

<DESC>Develop and demonstrate a prototype system employing state-of-the-art sensor technology for use in aerial, shipboard and ground-based ISR platforms (manned or unmanned). Potential imaging technologies include short-wave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MWIR), long-wave infrared (LWIR), HDTV and day cameras, low-light level cameras, image intensifiers, multispectral, laser range-finding/designation, and LiDAR. Selected sensor modalities will be integrated into high-performance gimbals, in combination with real-time on-board processing, and will provide ISR capabilities. The performance of developed algorithms will be modeled to determine requirements for system resolution. This will allow determination of the specifications for the system optics and detectors.<br /><br />PSC Code: &nbsp;AD92<br /><br />This award is based on Solicitation No. BAA-N00173-03. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">BAA Announcement N00173-03, Topic 56-13-05, Optical Sciences R&amp;D.</span>
