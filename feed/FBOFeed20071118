<DESC>The Final RFP will not be issued on November 16, 2007 as stated in L.15 of the Draft RFP.  We are expecting to issue the final RFP during the first half of December, with a closing date in January 2008.  Please note that the schedule for proposal submissions for Phase 1 will provide adequate time for offerors to prepare, as we are taking into account the possibility of reduced resources at many companies during late December.  Note that Federal Student Aid's website, under Doing Business with Us, now includes a CIO library of technical-related documents.  Offerors are reminded to go to the Acquisition website under Doing Business with Us to see the documents that are listed in Attachment J-16, Survey of Documents Matrix. We plan on making some key changes to the Final RFP, including: 1) artifacts for Phase 1 will be submitted at the same time as all of the other proposal documents; 2) subcontracting remains at the Task Order level and the prime may subcontract with any company it chooses provided the subcontractor meets the evaluation criteria set forth in the Task Order RFP;  3) the load for the IDIQ contract level that was to be in each of the labor rates has been deleted; 4) Key Personnel at the IDIQ contract level has been reduced to the possibility of one Key Personnel position (Program Manager) that will not be separately priced. All other Key Personnel positions will be specific to a Task Order, such as a Project Manager; 5) Attachment J-4B, Past Experience Form, of the Draft RFP will be revised to address Development-type past experience, as it currently has technical architecture-type experience.
