<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes - Oct 1997) and is published only to encourage interested Commercial Business parties capable of providing technical support for use by the Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Cryptographic Modernization Program Office (CMPO), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, for planning purposes only.
This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal, a solicitation, a request for quote or an indication that the government will contract for the items provided by submitter.  The government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested.
The Air Force CMPO is investigating improvements to the security of the SNMPv3 standard by incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B algorithms for message security.  The SNMPv3 standard is considered the most promising alternative for remote operational management of high assurance encryption products.  The fact sheet on NSA Suite B algorithms is located at:http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml
Suite B enhancements to SNMPv3 will be accomplished by finalizing the definition of the Datagram Transport Layer Security Transport Model [(D)TLS TM] for SNMPv3, which is currently under development by the Integrated Security Model for SNMP (ISMS) Working Group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  This (D)TLS TM will leverage the enhancements of the Transport Security Model (RFC 5591).  The current (D)TLS TM Internet-Draft document is awaiting publication as a Proposed Standard through the IETF Request for Comment process, and is located at:http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardaker-isms-dtls-tm-05

<ARCHDATE>09262009
<CONTACT>Linwood Gillette, 202-493-4753

<a href="mailto:linwood.gillette@faa.gov">linwood.gillette@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, TCAS II Version 7, known internationally as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS II), was released in 1998 and incorporated significant operational and technical improvements over the previous version (6.04A).  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandated ACAS II equipage in ANNEX 6, Part I, chapter 6.18 by January 1, 2003 for certain operators internationally.  This mandate elevated ACAS II as the worldwide collision avoidance standard.
It has recently been recognized that the current TCAS design may not be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the evolving National Airspace System (NAS), as reflected in the Joint Planning Development Office's (JPDO's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Concept of Operations, and the Operational Evolution Partnership's (OEP's) NextGen Solution Sets, as well as recent modifications that have been made to the TCAS logic.  Many elements of the current TCAS design date from the 1970s and 1980s, and reflect older methods of airspace use (i.e. air traffic control provided separation based on radar data, rigid route structures, airborne surveillance of Mode C and Mode S transponders providing range and altitude but not a target's identity or intent, no performance-based flight profiles, and no situational awareness or separation tools in the cockpit).  As a result, the current TCAS model may not be compatible with future NextGen envisioned procedures (i.e. continuous descent approaches (CDA), curved Required Navigation Performance (RNP) approaches, closely spaced parallel runways approaches, aircraft-based merging and spacing, closer parallel en route operations, lateral passing maneuvers in non-radar airspace) and additional collision avoidance functionality may need to be implemented as a means for addressing these envisioned shortfalls.
As new procedures are developed to support NextGen, collision avoidance will need to evolve to work in concert with these procedures.  In the near term, minor changes to TCAS may be sufficient to support smaller mid-term operational changes.  However, it is likely that collision avoidance will evolve and become an integral part of an air-to-air systems capability; thus, the distinction between "collision avoidance" and "separation assurance" may become blurred as these systems evolve.
The Draft Statement of work (SOW)  shown below states the technical areas in which the contractor will support the Federal Aviation Administration.  A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in the fall of 2009.  We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement, "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract(s).  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $17 Million over a 5 year period.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, environmental epidemiologist services with K P Cantor Environmental LLC, 708 Bonifant St., Silver Spring, MD 20910.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541620 and the business size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be a firm fixed price type contract.  Period of performance shall be for twelve months from date of award with two, one year option periods.</p>
<p>The OEEB conducts studies in the United States and abroad to identify and evaluate environmental and workplace exposures that may be associated with cancer risk. Research projects are designed to identify occupational, environmental, and other factors affecting cancer risk; to characterize exposure response relationships; to elucidate biological mechanisms of action; to identify susceptible populations and gene environment interactions; and to improve research methods for occupational investigations. Projects typically involve sophisticated exposure assessments, biological components for mechanistic evaluations, and intensive collaboration among epidemiologists, industrial hygienists, and molecular biologists.</p>
<p>The purpose of the procurement is to obtain the services of a high level senior environmental epidemiologist to support studies currently underway in the OEEB, especially the New England Bladder Cancer Study.  This is a critical study to which the Branch has devoted substantial resources to collecting epidemiologic and exposure assessment information.  These studies cannot be completed without further support.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be an environmental epidemiologist with a Ph.D. in, or extensive related experience in conducting and analyzing data from complex case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies involving detailed exposure assessment to a wide variety of drinking water contaminants.  The environmental epidemiologist must have demonstrated strong skills in analyzing epidemiologic data from case-control and cohort studies and detailed assessment of exposures to environmental contaminants in these studies.</p>
<p>During the course of the contract, the Contractor shall design, conduct, and guide epidemiologic analyses, and perform expert exposure assessment activities on epidemiologic studies requiring environmental epidemiologic support, especially the New England Bladder Cancer Study.</p>
<p>K P Cantor Environmental, LLC provides high quality support for environmental epidemiologic studies.  Its employer, Dr. Kenneth P. Cantor has worked on several major NCI studies, in particular the New England Bladder Cancer Study, the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study, and the Iowa Case-Control Study of Six Cancer Sites.  Dr. Cantor has an in-depth and intimate knowledge of these studies obtained through years of researching the exposure to arsenic, disinfection byproducts, and other drinking water contaminants; working closely with other epidemiologists, GIS specialists, and statisticians; and overseeing data collection in many realms.   To bring another experienced environmental epidemiologist up to speed on these studies would take at least six to twelve months.  This time delay is unacceptable since development of exposure assessment for water contaminants in the New England Bladder Cancer is well underway and valuable momentum for an extensive group of researchers would be lost if Dr. Cantor were not retained in a timely fashion.  Therefore, there is no other known environmental epidemiologist that possesses the experience, expertise, and detailed knowledge of these studies needed to allow them to immediately undertake the tasks covered by this procurement and complete them in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on August 19, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation No. NCI-90156-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT CONTRACT ACTION – The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The UCSF is located at 3333 California Street San Francisco, CA 94143.  This notice is being provided for information purposes only.

The UCSF is the only source that can provide x-ray readings and scoring of knee x-rays from the baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 month x-rays from the participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative. This will provide outcome data to enrich the Osteoarthritis Initiative database.  These readings will allow users to know whether subjects without disease have developed disease or subjects with disease have gotten worse.  This information is critical for evaluation of potential risk factors for development or progression of disease.  Providing these readings through UCSF’s standardized method will eliminate the variability that would result from many different individuals reading these x-rays independently. The resultant data will be posted on the Osteoarthritis Initiative public website after review by the staff at the data coordinating center at the UCSF.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Ohio University School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, 329 Stocker Center, Athens, Ohio 45701--2979 to provide data analysis of methylation signals for the Genome Technology Branch within the Division of Intramural Research at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).  
General Description:  
The Ohio University Bioinformatics Laboratory (OUBL) shall analyze DNA methylation data from ovarian tissue samples.  There are approximately 7 samples for normal tissue and 7 samples for late stage tumor tissue.  Each sample consists of ~24,000 data points.  Each data point consists of a gene name, a probe accession number, an intensity value (from 0-1) and a p-value. Bad data are indicated by a high p-value (>0.5).
 The hypothesis is that late stage ovarian tumor samples have different methylation patterns than normal ovarian samples.  To test the hypothesis, the OUBL shall determine which data points represent statistically significant changes.   The data shall be “cleaned,” i.e., data points with p-values > 0.5 shall be eliminated.  The remaining data points shall be analyzed to identify data points which are significantly different in tumor samples than in normal samples. The data points shall be grouped into three categories: (1) no difference, (2) increased methylation in tumor sample, and (3) decreased methylation in tumor sample.  Within each group, the data points shall be arranged by chromosomal locations and adjacent regions shall be identified. 
The period of performance is one month from time of award.  
The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2009-291-RD.  The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34, July 31, 2009. 
 The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.  
The sole source determination is based upon the fact that this requirement describes custom analysis of custom data. This analysis cannot be accomplished by other groups in a timely manner. The analysis requires a statistical clustering approach that requires a strong computational infrastructure.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 611699 and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million.   
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 252 ©(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2009-291-RD may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902,  Attention: Renee Dougherty.

Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative and received on or before August 17, 2009 at 1:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST).

<DESC><p>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Charles River Laboratories under NIA Contract HHSN260200400007C (N01-AG-40007). This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 9-year period of performance beginning on or about May 1, 2010, with an anticipated level of effort of approximately 5 FTEs in year 1, 10 FTEs in year 2, 16 FTEs in each of years 3-7, 11 FTEs in year 8 and 8 FTEs in year 9., to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory mice for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p>Current and projected experiments using rodents to model the aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. Therefore, a continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mice of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is nine years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the last two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year nine.</p>
<p>The colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 10,000 YEAR 4 72,000 YEAR 7 72,000<br />YEAR 2 48,000 YEAR 5 72,000 YEAR 8 40,000<br />YEAR 3 72,000 YEAR 6 72,000 YEAR 9 NEAR 0<br />The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for four inbred strains of mice and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the four inbred strains and two derivative hybrid strains. Mice will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 4,150 mice per month (the hybrid strains account for approximately 5% of the total entry levels).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all production space needed for the colony, including at least two independent barriers to house the colony, with independent back-up and alarm systems. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 2-3 years. Mice shall be provided with sterilized food (formulation consistent with NIH31 open formula) and bedding, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity range, light cycle, water treatment, etc.) as defined in the SOW.</p>
<p>Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the Project Officer as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship the mice to investigators, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, and climate-controlled transport. The Contractor shall invoice customers for the cost of the animals and all shipping costs, and apply the remittance to the cost of the contract. The Contractor shall weekly provide an inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the COTR.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service at Saratoga National Historical Park in Stillwater, NY is issuing solicitation Q1910090008 for boundary line fuel breaks.  This solicitation is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 561730, and the size standard is $7 million.  This solicitation will result in a firm fixed price service contract.  Wage determinations apply and are attached to the solicitation.
The solicitation is available at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Quotes are due by September 4, 2009.  A pre-bid site visit may be scheduled by contacting the park at (518) 664-9821.
Scope of Work (not all inclusive, see solicitation for full requirements):-Provide all labor, equipment and materials with the objective of cutting a 50-foot boundary fuel break with the intent of eliminating a continuous arrangement of surface, aerial and canopy fuels.  
-Cut the first 10' width from the Park boundary line into park lands and remove all fuels - brush and trees (up to 3" DBH (diameter at breast height)), raise up all ladder fuels (lower limbs) up to 10' high, remove all dead brush.  All dead and downed trees in excess of 3" in diameter shall be cut into 2-3' sections.  Every third section shall be pushed away from the others which will break the continuity of the fuel type.  Flush cut all stumps in a professional manner to within 1" of the ground when possible. 
-Continue an additional 40' into park lands selectively thinning, pruning, and removing dead and downed wood, raising up all ladder fuels (lower limbs) up to 10' high and flush cutting all stumps in a professional manner to within 1" of the ground.  All dead and downed trees in excess of 3" in diameter shall be cut into 2-3' sections.  Every third section shall be pushed away from the others which will break the continuity of the fuel type.
-Cut stumps will be treated with an appropriate, approved herbicide(s).  Agriculturally-approved colorants or marking dyes will be used in conjunction with the herbicides.  Use of herbicides, colorants and marking dyes requires the prior approval of the park superintendent.  Two weeks advance notice is required when submitting herbicides for park superintendent consideration.  Product labels and MSDS sheets will be provided to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) at the time an herbicide use request is made.  Use of herbicides, colorants and dyes will be in strict conformance with all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Application of herbicides on NPS property requires the possession of a valid New York State Pesticide Applicators License. All herbicides, colorants and/or dyes will be used in strict conformance with the manufacture's product label.  The park COTR will be provided all application information necessary for the completion of annual NPS pesticide use reports.
-Disposal of debris can be by chipping if possible. Note: there is a limited opportunity for chipping due to limited access along some portions of some boundary lines.  Woodchips can be left but need to be broadcasted and dispersed in a way to eliminate any piles.  Debris can also be dragged and dispersed 100' and beyond inside park boundaries when and where possible.  The idea is to scatter the brush eliminating the buildup of piles and any obvious quantities of fuel.  Note:  In some portions of this unit where the disposal of debris is in close proximity to visitor amenities and a potential for the creation of an eyesore exists, the NPS will require extra precautions for debris removal be taken that are above and beyond the parameters otherwise stated.  In areas of close proximity to visitor amenities it may be necessary to drag debris beyond 100' limit and/or remove woodchips as opposed to broadcasting.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division will be issuing a solicitation to procure Cisco products on a Firm Fixed Price basis using FAR part 12 procedures.Cisco hardware items are required to replace deficient equipment in the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Laboratory; specifically Cisco Catalyst Series 10/100/1000 GE 10 GE workgroup switches (14 each), Cisco GE SFPLC SX connectors (28 each), and Cisco 2811 Adv Security bundle router (6 each).  This laboratory environment uses simulations to create and replicate operational scenarios; therefore, commonality and compatibility with existing laboratory equipment is  required to ensure that aircraft and operational scenarios are identically replicated.  In view of a recent DOD mandate for National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) and Common Criteria certification, the deficient equipment must be replaced with identical components that are 100% compatible with existing laboratory gear.  Cisco is the only known manufacturer that can comply with this requirement as well as comply with the existing operational software development environments.  Any equivalent products must seamlessly (plug and play) interface with fully operational hardware and software.  Satisfying this requirement by utilizing another manufacturer's product would entail verifying, validating and testing their product to ensure compatability with existing laboratory equipment.  This requires a significant expenditure that includes verifying and validating the laboratory environment and operational software, which would require closing multiple laboratories for extended periods of time.  The items are being procured under FAR Part 12 and 13.5 commercial acquisition procedures.  A solicitation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online Website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS Website at https://www.fbo.gov on or about 20 August 2009, with offers due on or about 08 September 2009.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>As efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels come to fruition, there is a need to develop more efficient powertrains.  The US Army is launching a four year program to develop new powertrain technologies which will improve overall efficiency by reducing fuel consumption, providing exportable electrical power, reducing noise, and by developing powertrains which consume a wide range of fuels. Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Specifically, under this topic, the Government invites proposals regarding an electronically controlled powertrain, consisting of a diesel engine, a longitudinal transmission, and a high output optimized electrical generator device, which reduces fuel consumption, provides exportable electrical power, reduces noise, and is able to operate on a variety of fuel combinations and mixtures.<BR><BR>1.

Funding:  Maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2010 through 2013 is $7.8M.  Subparts A through D below describe the estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions. Estimated funding includes:<BR><BR>A.	$1.32M in FY10<BR>B.	$1.92M in FY11<BR>C.	$2.12M in FY12<BR>D.	$2.44M in FY13<BR><BR>3.

<p><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Electrical Distribution System:</strong> Hanscom AFB electrical service is provided at 14.4-kilovolts (kV) through three sets of 500-thousand-circular-mill (kcmil or MCM) EPR cables to the Base substation. At the Base perimeter, near the Small Business Office (Building 1100) and the former Phillips Laboratory Gate (Gate 3), a manhole is located where responsibility for the electrical system shifts from NSTAR, the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) provider, and Transcanada, the commodity provider, to Hanscom AFB.</p>
<p>From the manhole at the Base perimeter, the circuits are routed through an underground duct bank to the Base&rsquo;s main substation. This substation serves as the main power distributor for the entire Base. That portion of the substation where the main incoming and feeder breakers are housed is made up of a section of walk in metal enclosed switchgear. This is where the Electric Utility owned revenue meters are located. The switchgear main bus is rated for 2,000 A at 15 kV. The main incoming NSTAR lines and bus tie circuit breakers are rated 2,000 amperes (A) and the feeder breakers are rated 1,200 A, all at 15 kV. The switchgear is arranged in a four bus configuration with an incoming feed serving each of three of the four buses with tie breakers between adjacent buses. Each of the four buses has three feeder breakers for serving load. Spaces for three spare breakers are available on Bus No. 2 and 3 to allow for future expansion. From the main bus, three breakers feed the three 3,750-kV amperes (kVA), 14.4- to 4160/2520-V power transformers located in the substation. One of the transformers feeds the former Phillips Laboratory and part of the former Rome Laboratory area. A second (newest) transformer serves the on-Base steam and chilled water plant. The third transformer is used as a spare transformer and may be used to backup either of the two utilized transformers. Switching arrangements are available to shift loads and services among all three transformers. From the main bus, five distribution circuits feed the remainder of the Base.</p>
<p>All primary feed is contained within concrete encased conduit, 75% of which under pavement.</p>
<p>The Hanscom AFB electric distribution system is currently monitored by fault indicator equipment at 73 total locations throughout the main base. Fault indicator equipment is connected to the EMCS system on the electric distribution wiring. The SCADA system reads the substation. Equipment is monitored at the computer in the Exterior Electric Shop, Building 1817. A SCADA system reads the substation.</p>
<p>NSTAR is the transportation and distribution provider and Transcanada is the commodity provider that supplies power to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreational Area through a single service at the main entrance.</p>
<p>National Grid supplies power to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility through a tap from the 4.16-kilovolt (kV) distribution feeder on Sagamore Street. Located at the feeder tap are the metering facilities and riser pole transition down to the government-owned underground circuit that feeds up the hill and into the station. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the air break switch located at the metering facilities along Sagamore Street.</p>
<p>The Town of Hudson&rsquo;s Office of the Light and Power Department supplies power to the Sudbury Geophysics Research Annex through one overhead service to the facility. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the primary metering pole along Hudson Road.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Water Distribution System:<br /></strong></span>The Hanscom AFB water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The utility system is composed of, without limitation, valves, fire hydrants, water distribution mains, meters, and storage tanks. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Approximately 6,800 linear feet of cast iron piping owned by the U.S. Navy.<br />&bull; Hanscom AFB Military Family Housing water distribution<br />&bull; Mobile Home Park remaining water distribution system<br />&bull; Ipswich Antenna Test Facility<br />The Town of Lexington provides 95 percent of the potable water supply to Hanscom AFB through three metered connections:<br />&bull; Hartwell Avenue connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 8-inch main connects to the Town of Lexington main at the Town of Lexington-owned meter on Hartwell Avenue. <br />&bull; Wright Street connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 10-inch main, located within a 50-foot wide easement through an off-Base housing development, connects to the Town of Lexington-owned meter near Katahdin Hill on Wright Street. <br />&bull; Wood Street Emergency connection - this connection is made through a normally closed 8-inch main on Wood Street which connects to the Town of Lexington owned meter connection, which is approximately 100 feet southeast of its intersection with Hartwell Avenue. <br />The remaining 5 percent of potable water supplied to the Base serves the trailer park and Family Camp area located north of Massport's L.G. Hanscom Airport. The trailer park is served by the Town of Bedford through a meter owned by the Air Force; the Family Camp area is served by the Town of Lexington through an Air Force-owned meter. <br />Hanscom AFB, as well as both towns, receive their water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). The Town of Lexington and the Town of Bedford provide water at separate locations on the installation which are not connected and are separately metered. Hanscom AFB holds a 1996 Certificate of Registration (PWS ID# 3023002) from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Water Supply as a registered public water supplier in Massachusetts. The Towns of Lexington and Bedford, which supply the water, provide water quality monitoring. MWRA provides disinfection. The Base has discontinued the use of its hypochlorite injection disinfection systems this is because of the stability of the disinfection approach where the water system generally contains approximately 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of available chlorine. Hanscom AFB currently provides no additional disinfection for the water system.<br />The water supply pressure from the City is too high for standard municipal service and, therefore, is reduced for use on the Base at two pressure reducing valve stations which then provide adequate water pressure on Base. As noted above, the Base can supplement the disinfection provided by the Town of Lexington to the main Base, if necessary, with three onsite chlorination systems, but discontinued their use in January 2001.<br />The average depth of the buried pipe at Hanscom AFB is approximately six to eight feet.<br />The military family housing areas are not a part of the system to be privatized. Military family housing connects to the Hanscom AFB installation main at six locations: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #1</span> is at the downstream connection to main water valve (MWV) 46A. This is the connection of the Military Family Housing 8" main with the Hanscom AFB main. This is located at the center of Vandenburg drive, near BLDG 1630.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #2</span> is at the downstream connection to MWV 146, this is the connection of the 10" Hanscom AFB main from Marrett Road with the Military Family Housing main on Offutt Road. This is located where the system intersects with the Leased Area boundary.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #3</span> is at the downstream connection of MWV 93E, where the service lateral for Building 2001 leaves the Hanscom AFB main. This is located on Ent Road approximately 150 linear feet northeast of the intersection of Ent Road with Patterson Road.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #4</span> is at MWV 93B, located at the south east corner of the intersection of Patterson Road and Ent Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #5</span> is at MWV 93A, located on Ent Road near the intersection with Patterson Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD#6</span> is at valve 1145, located near the intersection of Adams Road and Colonial Place. This POD is located to the south of Building 1994. Ownership includes the valve.<br />The City of Marshfield, through a cooperative agreement with the Town of Scituate, supplies potable water to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreation Area from a Town of Scituate main located near the facility gate. A Town of Scituate water meter, located near the connection, meters water consumption. The potable water distribution system serves cabins and other structures, and recreational vehicle (RV) hookups. <br />The Town of Hamilton supplies potable water to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility from a Town main located near the gate. A Town water meter located at the main building meters water consumption. Water consumption is estimated to be less than 250 gallons per day (gpd).</p>

<p>The Hanscom AFB wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, infrastructure identified in Table 1. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the UP Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The UP Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are:<br />&bull; oil water separators<br />&bull; grease traps<br />&bull; storm sewers<br />&bull; groundwater treatment system<br />&bull; former trailer park site<br />Wastewater generated by Hanscom AFB discharges into Town of Bedford by sanitary sewer main(s) via four (4) Town of Bedford owned manholes along the east side of the Base, after which it travels south to Town of Bedford's wastewater treatment plant. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Hanscom AFB. <br />The sanitary wastewater system at Hanscom AFB includes collection mains, two main pump stations, and one small pump station, each of which is described below. Wastewater is discharged to the Town of Bedford's sewer system. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides treatment for wastewater in the region. <br />The collection piping consists of vitrified clay, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping. There are no wastewater treatment facilities on Base. The average depth of buried piping is approximately eight feet.<br />The Upper Main pump station (Building 1306) sewage pumping controls were upgraded in 1999. The pump station includes three pumps located in a below grade concrete dry well. The pumps draw from two wet wells that have a combined capacity of 250,000 gallons. The station is designed for two pumps, with one on stand-by. The Upper Main pump station pumps the Base's total sewage flow to the Town of Bedford's sewer force main through a new ductile iron pipe force main constructed in 1996 along Hartwell Avenue. The point of connection is at Route 2 with Bedford's force main; from there the flow continues on to the regional treatment facility owned by MWRA. There also is a Town of Bedford metered connection at the intersection of Wood Street and Hartwell Ave., which is used for emergency overflow only. <br />The Lower Main pump station (Building 1539) was rebuilt in 1987 and pumps upgraded in 1994. The Lower Main lift station includes three centrifugal pumps (two duty pumps plus a standby) located in a concrete dry well. The pumps draw from a wet well that has a maximum working capacity of approximately 7,500 gallons. One small lift station is also used to provide collection for Building 1101.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael Scott Arbon, Contract Negotiator, Phone 8015862246, Email michael.arbon@hill.af.mil
<DESC><p><strong>Overview:</strong>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information is to assist Hill AFB Utah, Range Threat Systems Program Office (RTSPO) in Market Research of Industry to determine the extent of effort and estimated cost necessary to reach a Technical Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6) and Preliminary Design Review (PDR) package necessary for the JI2 program to proceed to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Milestone B phase.</p>
<p>The RTSPO is proposing a phased acquisition approach for the JI2 program. Multiple contractors may be selected through source selection to participate in the Technology Development (TD) phase (1st contract award). The purpose of the TD phase is for selected contractors to verify appropriate software/hardware TRL and complete a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) that includes a formal PDR report and associated design drawings and documentation for government approval and recommendation to the Milestone Decision Authority to enter the Milestone B (EMD) phase.</p>
<p>The second phase of the program (EMD phase) will provide a 2nd contract award, which will employ full and open competition. Contractors involved during the first phase (TD) may choose to submit the designs developed when submitting their respective proposals. Other contractors not participating in the 1st contract phase will NOT be excluded from this 2nd phase and may also submit proposals for consideration. One contractor will be selected for the EMD phase to develop a complete pre-production unit, perform factory and field level testing (Site Acceptance Test) and complete Functional and Physical Configuration Audits to qualify the design. If the design meets all requirements and is accepted by the government, the 2nd contract will also contain an option to produce up to 20 production units. The government is requesting a minimum of government purpose data rights for 1st and 2nd contract. For the purpose of this RFI, no information is required or requested for the 2nd contract award phase.</p>
<p><strong>JI2 System Description:</strong></p>
<p>The following is a top-level description of the JI2 system. This description is not intended to be all inclusive, but should be used to answer this RFI:</p>
<p>The development and delivery of a threat emitter system (as identified in the fourth paragraph of the "overview" section above) will be an unclassified, high-fidelity emitter system that shall emulate some or all of the signals of the SA-15b. The minimum signals to represent are the SA-15b target acquisition and tracking radar signals, but desire full emulation. The emitter system is expected to have a minimum of two radars, one for acquisition and the second (phased array) for target tracking and missile guidance. Both will include the capability to initiate a track using skin tracking and emulate the SA-15b system operation.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT – MARKET RESEARCH NOTICE
Notice Number:	NIH-NHLBI-SS-10-16
Project Title:		National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Other Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC)
Background

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is interested in renewing the Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC) contract for a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to manage a registry of patients with conditions related to genetically-induced thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). GenTAC has been established to facilitate studies by GenTAC investigators and others that will advance multiple scientific frontiers in thoracic aortic disease. Genetic, proteomic, clinical, and imaging data will be integrated systematically with outcomes data to determine the optimal clinical management of patients with genetically induced TAAs. To date, there are five Regional Clinical Centers (RCCs) (as subcontracts of the DCC) participating and over 1400 patients enrolled in the Registry. 

Although our understanding of the genetic basis of inherited predisposition to thoracic aortic disease has expanded, more than 80 percent of the genetic mutations responsible for genetically determined TAAs have yet to be identified. Further insight into the genes that trigger TAAs and aortic dissections and how to recognize individuals with these genetic mutations will help to prevent premature deaths due to thoracic aortic disease. Moreover, identification of a mutant gene that predisposes to TAA formation offers an opportunity to understand the pathologic mechanisms. Elucidation of the functional importance of genetic mutations has excellent potential for translation to therapeutic interventions, but is limited by difficulties in obtaining biospecimens for investigation and identification of kindred families by centers with expertise in genomic applications. Animal models of Marfan syndrome demonstrate functional significance of genetic mutations and suggest new strategies for therapeutic prevention and treatment. These findings require confirmation in patients. A central resource like GenTAC will serve as a conduit to address many of these questions.

Purpose and Objectives

The goal of the proposed program is to continue and expand data and biospecimens collection of patients with conditions related to genetically-induced TAAs. The overriding purpose of the Registry is to establish and analyze a central biospecimen and clinical data repository to better understand genetically triggered TAAs and their treatment.  Ultimately the registry is an essential tool enabling new research to reduce cardiovascular complications which represent the primary cause of morbidity and premature death in persons with thoracic aortic disease and especially with genetically triggered TAAs. The Registry is the only avenue for these rare conditions to establish a resource that can be used by the research community to further understand and study the genetic basis of TAAs and to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of affected patients.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Protected Resources Division in St. Petersburg, FL., intends to award a sole source purchase order to the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fl two projects one for monitoring of Smalltooth Sawfish and one for integration , maintenance and growth of the National Sawfish Encounter Database as a tool for assisting in the recovery of the federally endangered smalltooth sawfish. <br /><br />Project Title : Monitoring of Smalltooth, Pristis pectinata, in the Indian River Lagoo, FL.
<p>The remaining population of the federally endangered Smalltooth Sawfish, Prisitis pectinata, is essentially confined to Florida waters with its core centered in extreme southwest Florida and the Florida Keys. Current monitoring of the study area began in 2008. The current monitoring program consists of random sampling within the Banana River and Indian River Lagoon system from Titusville south to Palm Shores using gillnets and short trotlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History's (FLMNH) has the required endangered species permits to handle the endangered smalltooth sawfish and the restricted access rights to sections of the Banana River restricted by Cape Canaveral Space Center. Project <br /><br />Title: Integration and Growth of Smalltooth Sawfish Database</p>
<p>The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) was listed as endangered under the Enangered Species Act (ESA) on April 1, 2003. During its listing process under the ESA, the National Sawfish Encounter Database (NSED), initially housed at Mote Marine Laboratory (MML), created in 1999 as a tracking database to gather information regarding smalltooth sawfish encounters, both recent and historic. After the species was listed under the ESA in 2003, the database was maintained to assist recovery managers and researchers in the evaluation of sawfish abundance, range, habitat preferences, and as a mechanism to document the success of recovery initiatives.</p>
<p>As an ongoing project, most of the NSED initiatives that started in late 2008 must continue during the next project year. Most the database integration process has been completed, but there is unfinished work. Furthermore, because the public has to be continually educated about the status of sawfishes and the need to report encounters, during 2009 all outreach initiatives started in 2008 will continue and be augmented. Additionally, innovative tasks are presented for 2009 regarding both the database integration and the outreach initiatives. Task 1: Database integration and archival. Task 2: Ongoing adding of new records to the database (months 1 to 12).Task 3: Development of a database in Microsoft Access format. Transform the new integrated NSED, currently in an Excel format, into a Microsoft Access format. Task 4: Outreach initiatives. The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) has proprietary rights to the smalltooth sawfish encounter data and currently manages the data for the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>The contractor must have an endangered species permit for the smalltooth sawfish from the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) to handle and perform monitoring duties. The contractor must have at least 5 years of experience in sampling, tagging and tracking elasmobranches. The contractor must be also familiar with the sampling region.</p>

<CONTACT>Mona M. Ash, Phone 206-526-6384, Fax 206-527-6025, Email mona.m.ash@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified small business concerns capable of furnishing two research cruises for Pacific cod using a single chartered fishing vessel in 2009 and 2010 to tag and release cod and to collect catch data and biological data on cod and incidental species in the eastern Bering Sea. In lieu of compensation, the Pacific cod catch shall be retained by the charter vessel.
<p>The research longline cruise in 2009 will consist of 30 sampling days in the eastern Bering Sea. The cruise will begin as soon as possible after the finish of the 2009 B-Season for Pacific cod longline fishing in the eastern Bering Sea (on or about 1 November 2009) and end 35 to 40 days later, depending on mobilization and demobilization time and days lost to weather. The cruise will begin and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.</p>
<p>The research longline cruise in 2010 will consist of 30 sampling days in the eastern Bering Sea. The cruise will begin as soon as possible after the finish of the 2010 A-Season for Pacific cod longline fishing in the eastern Bering Sea (on or about 4 January 2010) and end 35 to 40 days later, depending on mobilization and demobilization time and days lost to weather. The cruise will begin and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.</p>
<p>VESSEL REQUIREMENTS for longline operations:</p>
<p>1. Minimum registered length 41.1 m (135 ft), although the preferred vessel registered length is 45.7 m (150 ft) or greater.</p>
<p>2. Minimum main engine continuous horsepower sufficient to permit a cruising speed of 18.5 km/hr (10 kts) in a moderate sea state.</p>
<p>3. Able to accommodate a field party of 8, including 4 contract scientists provided by the vessel.</p>
<p>4. The vessel must have an endurance capability for operating and fishing for a minimum of 40 consecutive days, including running to and from stations.</p>
<p>5. Completely rigged and ready to fish longline gear. The gear shall be provided by the vessel and include, but not limited to, the tackle and machinery necessary for setting and retrieving, flag-and-buoy arrays, buoy line, anchors, running line, and ground line with baited hooks. An auto-baiting system is preferred. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. The contractor shall determine Hook size, hook spacing, and all other attributes of the tackle. Each unit of gear (e.g. magazine, rack, skate, etc) shall have the same ground line material and length, the same tackle fixing hooks to ground line, the same hook size, the same hook spacing, and the same number of hooks. Units of gear that vary by more than two percent (2%) from the number of hooks specified by the contractor shall not be deployed.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall furnish bait for each cruise. Each hook shall be baited with chopped squid in an amount per hook that is appropriate to the auto-baiting machinery. The bait shall be East Coast or North Atlantic squid (Illex illecebrosus), 2-3 count per lb or larger; Loligo or market squid is not acceptable. The general commercial designation is brown color, fit for human consumption (used as an index of freshness), and 100-200 grams per squid. The head and legs will not be used for bait, only the mantle and viscera. The mantle length should be 15-23 cm (6-9 in) long. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. At the beginning of each cruise, the vessel shall be supplied with a single lot of bait sufficient to last the duration of that cruise. Changes in bait characteristics during the course of the cruise will render catch rates incomparable from station to station. Calculation of the required amount of bait depends on the baiting characteristics of the vessel's fishing gear and the expected amount of fishing in a research cruise (see note below on the expected amount of fishing).</p>
<p>7. The vessel shall provide freezer storage, exclusive of that for ship stores, sufficient to store at least 272 mt (600,000 lb) of dressed and frozen fish. If more cod are caught than can be carried in the vessel's freezer storage then a mid-cruise off-load can be negotiated between the Government and the contractor.</p>
<p>8. Contract Scientific Personnel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Contractor shall provide at least four (4) trained biologists to conduct standard survey data collection operations that shall perform 1) catch tallying of individual hooks; 2) length and sex sampling of catch; 3) recording and editing data in appropriate forms and computer files.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Personnel must receive training in the above operations by Government survey scientists prior to participation in the survey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Personnel shall be employed by a qualified scientific firm or institute engaged in marine fisheries research, or in providing scientific personnel.</p>
<p>9. The vessel and officer licensing requirements shall be sufficient to permit the chartered vessel to carry eight (8) personnel in the field party (both male and female).</p>
<p>EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FISHING</p>
<p>The research fishing to be conducted on these cruises has not been done in previous years so there is no historical basis for an expected catch of Pacific cod and incidental species under these fishing protocols. The object of these charters is to maintain high data accuracy and consistency.</p>
<p>In each cruise, there shall be one day of fishing at each of thirty stations. If foul weather prevents fishing at a particular station then fishing operations shall cease until conditions permit their resumption and that station can be sampled. Each station shall be fished on a 24-hour cycle, including running time from the previous station, which may be as much as 10 hours for the 10 stations in the strata with lower sampling density. Based on the constraints the offeror can expect the chartered vessel to be able to run about half the gear that would be deployed during open access fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 40,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 20,000 hooks per day during the research fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 70,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 35,000 hooks per day during the research fishing. These are conservative estimates and a larger number of hooks may be fished per day in strata with higher station density, though this is not certain.</p>
<p>The number of cod removed from the research catch for scientific purposes is expected to be about 300 per day. The remainder of the catch shall be turned over to the vessel.</p>
<p>Period of performance shall begin on or about 1 November 2009 for the first cruise. The second cruise shall begin on or about 4 January 2010. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 532411 with a size standard of $7M. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA at http://orca.bpn.gov) is required.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ISSUED BY THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. HOWEVER, RESPONSES MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR A FUTURE ACQUISITION.
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will not issue paper copies of this request. The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of Future Naval Capabilities programs. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.</p>
<p>This Announcement issued by NRL solicits industry and academic Sources to express their capability to provide advanced rubber coating systems for U.S. Navy ship rudders. As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks to develop new processes to increase substantially the performance of current coating systems against cavitation erosion.</p>
<p>Contractors are encouraged to consider novel elastomeric compounds and formulations to achieve the desired goals. Polychloroprene or EPDM compounds are preferred, but any type of rubber will be evaluated if there is reason to believe it will meet the requirements. The rubber material is expected to be a cold-bond rubber "sheet" applied over a suitable steel primer and adhesive tie-coat. A spray-applied "liquid-rubber" coating will be considered with adequate supporting data. In all cases the proposed materials must be tested and qualified together: primer, adhesive, and rubber. If a non-adhering rubber sheet material shows superior mechanical performance in flow testing, the Navy would also consider using a supplemental mechanical bonding approach to aid in retaining the material on the rudder substrate.</p>
<p>In concert with consideration of new processes and materials, the Navy has also established goals which will govern the development options. These are established with the intent of making near-final products available to the fleet by Government Fiscal Year 2011 (Starting October 2010). These supplementary goals include: (a) a goal of developing low solvent and HAP free coatings but in no case should the VOC / HAP content of the materials and adhesives exceed statutory requirements for marine coatings, (b) coating application should be via currently available technology-exceptions must be justified by cost / performance benefits and the alternative application process must be otherwise commercially available by October 2010, (c) resin choices should focus on available or nearly available technologies or combinations thereof to minimize the technology readiness (by October 2010) risk, and (d) all coatings shall meet the hazardous pigment, additive and toxicity requirements of the referenced military specifications-exceptions must be identified and justified on the basis of performance.</p>
<p>To support the aggressive technology development / field demonstration schedule, an additional requirement is for the Source to demonstrate the capacity within any resultant contract to provide the Navy with substantial product to facilitate test applications shipboard. This may be estimated as 1,000 ft2 of material per ship-set.</p>
<p>The improved rudder materials / coatings shall meet or exceed the 6-month, magnesium anode, cathodic disbondment requirement of MIL-PRF-23236C. The systems evaluated in this test shall be the full rubber / adhesive system proposed for in-service rudders. In NRL-designed flow channel tests, these coatings shall out-perform current rudder coating systems which are based on a trowel-applied epoxy mastic technology at ~ &frac14;-inch thickness. The new coating shall improve cavitation resistance by a factor of 50% and erosion resistance by 20% versus current Navy standards. NRL has also identified rudder flexing (or "oil-canning") as a factor in the failure. The coatings can be subject to considerable strain as the result of the rudder flex, especially under dynamic conditions. The selection of the elastomer must balance the tensile strength and breaking elongation requirements possibly needed to enhance cavitation resistance with the elasticity sought to overcome the local strain effects. These are key considerations for improved rudder coatings. Based on previous testing, the Navy believes that rubber materials with properties in the range described below may be optimal. This remains to be confirmed but represents the current best-knowledge.</p>
<p>Hardness (Shore A) ~ 40 - 50</p>
<p>Tensile Strength ~ 8-12 MPa</p>
<p>Elongation ~ 600 to 700%</p>
<p>Modulus (@ 300% Elongation) ~ 2-4 MPa</p>
<p>Glass Transition Temperature ~ -45 &#730;C min.</p>
<p>These systems should have a minimum service life of 2 to 5 years. Testing will eventually include field application to Navy ships should initial screening tests prove promising. Coating systems may consist of one or more coats, including consideration of flex / cathodic disbondment resistant primers and erosion / cavitation resistant topcoats.</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>To minimize costs to potential contractors in responding to the subject announcement, each contractor is encouraged to submit an initial White Paper of no more than five (5) pages in length for each specific coating technology offered. A single Source may submit multiple White Papers. White Papers may be submitted via e-mail to the Point of Contact Listed below. Alternatively, Hard Copies (1 original + 2 copies) may be mailed to the Point of Contact. All White Papers must be received by the requested due date.</p>
<p>The Navy requests that White Papers be provided by 15 SEP 2009. The Navy desires to initiate laboratory testing on initial trial products by October 2009. Items (a) through (d) listed above, technology maturity, and manufacturing capacity shall be included. Each Source should also provide a two (2) page maximum resume or curriculum vitae for the Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>Immediate questions should be addressed in writing to Mr. Edward Lemieux, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6136, 4555 Overlook Avenue S.W, Washington, DC 20375. Mr. Lemieux's FAX number is <br />(202) 767-4642 and the e-mail address is <a href="mailto:Lemieux@nrl.navy.mil">Lemieux@nrl.navy.mil</a>. No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC>BID REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONVA-247-09-RA-0251Project:  Renovate Coronary Care Unit, Project # 521-08-105, Birmingham, AlabamaContract Specialist:  Tracy RileyRFI #2						   Question:  After reviewing the drawings and specs, then comparing them to the solicitation on the project noted above, I have become confused.The solicitation for the project, on page 1 of 214, under Alt4ernate Bid Item 2, states, Provide all work specified in main bid with the exception of new patient headwall units.  Head wall units are to be repaired and re-laminated.I am confused because on Sheet A-101 of the drawings, all of the Demo Notes (5, 21 and 22), Construction Notes (13, 24, 25 and 26) and the notes on Detail 4  Typical Cardio Care Unit which apply to the headwall, are all written to indicate that a refurbishment of the headwall units is taking place.I need clarification on what the intent is.  If new headwall units are required as part of the base bid, much additional information needs to be provided.  A drawing elevation is needed to show the location of all required shelving, lighting, med gas connections, vacuum connections, power outlets, and other specialty connections for the new headwall.  Information is needed regarding depth of headwall and placement within the room.  A specification and list of acceptable manufacturers is also needed.  There may be additional information which is required that I cannot think of at this time.If the intent is to do the refurbishment, we appear to have sufficient information to bid this scope, but the solicitation would require revision.Please clarify the VAs intent regarding this area of the scope of work.VA response:  The VAs intent regarding this area of the scope is work is to adhere to the bid requests shown on page 1 of the solicitation package.  New headwall units are desired as part of the base bid.  Below is the information needed to bid the job.  	The manufacturer for the headwall unit is Hill-Rom and the style is Elements.  An approved equal is allowable.	The location of all required shelving, lighting, med gas connections, vacuum connections, power outlets, and other connections will remain in their current locations.	The website for Hill-Rom is http://www.hill-rom.com/usa/AP_Elements.htm

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Cultural Insights from the Use of Metaphors
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-09-04
<RESPDATE>090909
<ARCHDATE>09102010
<CONTACT>Heather McCallum-Bayliss, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-09-04@ugov.gov
<DESC><p>Synopsis<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This Request for Information (RFI) provides information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to address adequately the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated into, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest along with<br />instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Scope<br />Metaphors are generally known as poetic or rhetorical devices that are unique and therefore can only be listed as creative instances of language use. Recent research, however, especially in the neurosciences and cognitive linguistics, has established metaphorical processes as a fundamental cognitive mechanism that begins in infancy. As humans mature, they combine metaphors in increasingly complex ways and expand their use to reflect social and cultural norms. As yet, metaphorical language has not been systematically accounted for by the Natural Language Processing community; as a result, automated resources are limited.</p>
<p>Much of the current characterization of societal attitudes or mindsets is produced by social scientists through observation, polling or impressionistic associations. Although these approaches provide valuable insights, unconscious views and attitudes are often overlooked or lost. A deep understanding of the contrasts among worldviews is rarely achieved.</p>
<p>Communication theory also attempts to characterize how opinions and beliefs are shared and propagated. Theorists observe how messages are transmitted and understood, through the media, for example, but the focus is generally on the structure of the message and less on the source of the message. It is only within the last few years that communication theorists have begun to consider mental processes and metaphorical thinking as crucial to image making, for example.</p>
<p>IARPA is interested in the premise that analysis of how people use metaphor in oral and written communication can provide valuable insights into the similarities and differences in worldview across cultures and subcultures. IARPA is seeking information about the challenges associated with the science and technologies related to the discovery and analysis of metaphor usage. Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing specific information that addresses the following issues. Areas of specific interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1) Advanced techniques and technologies that will discover, collect and capture linguistic metaphors;<br />2) Association of metaphors with abstract concepts;<br />3) Categorization of metaphors;<br />4) Contrast of metaphors across cultures, subcultures and social context;<br />5) Methods and processes for the interpretation(s) of the use of metaphor;<br />6) Ideas for testing and evaluating the use of metaphor, including experimental designs and social science approaches to evaluation.</p>
<p>Also of interest are methodologies that could build on the use of metaphors to provide insights into larger narratives/issues.</p>
<p>IARPA is not interested in the following dimensions of metaphor:</p>
<p>1) Translation of metaphors across languages;<br />2) Collection and storage of linguistic metaphors with no generalization of their use;<br />3) Issues associated with the teaching of metaphors; and<br />4) Metaphor research that does not involve or result in insights into the use of metaphor.</p>
<p>The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one- to two-day workshop on the use of metaphor, the result of which may justify a competitive program. The selection of topics and setting of the agenda of this workshop will be informed by the responses. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in the Fall of 2009. A separate workshop announcement will be posted with further details.</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-09-04.<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary;<br />3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);<br />4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions to Respondents<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm, Local Time, College Park, MD on September 9, 2009. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-09-04@ugov.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarparfi-09-04@ugov.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephonic<br />inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES<br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and new program planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<SUBJECT>RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information through integration with the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN)
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-10-1001
<RESPDATE>072209
<CONTACT>Syreeta  Gay, Email SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  Response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to exchange information with industry related to its efforts to improve the speed and quality of its Disability Determination Process.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for the Nation’s two primary Federal Disability Programs: Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.  Due to the significant growth in disability applications over the last 5 years, the increased complexity of those applications, limited resources, medical advances, changing health information technology, and outdated policies, our ability to process disability applications have fallen short of our own expectations.  We request an estimated 15-20 million medical records each year from healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, physicians, psychologists, and other health professionals) across the country to obtain evidence of an individual’s medical condition.  Providing medical records is very labor-intensive and expensive for healthcare facilities.  In addition, some facilities require the use of their own forms and some do not respond to our requests for medical records at all.  As a result, we are forced to obtain and retain paper originals of authorization forms and in some instances schedule consultative examinations when medical sources do not respond to our requests.  The current process results in significant burdens on applicants, providers, and the government.  

OBJECTIVE: While there is no single solution to improve our disability determination process; one of SSA’s proposed solutions is to expand our current Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health Information Technology (MEGAHIT) project by recruiting additional health care providers and networks to automate the exchange of medical records.  Automating the solution for Release of Information will save time and money for the providers and will also make SSA’s decision determination process more efficient and effective.  To achieve this goal, SSA contemplates awarding fixed price contracts to expand the number of healthcare providers participating in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN).  This will be done through a full and open, competitive, fixed-price request for proposal (RFP) contracting process.  SSA hopes to award contracts to organizations representing Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and Specialty Care Providers/Facilities. This effort will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds and payment will be made to awarded contractors upon successful completion of the implementation and successful response to several production requests from SSA with the transmission of verified Continuity of Care Documents (CCD).

Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to gauge interest of healthcare providers willing to participate in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), develop the capability to receive standardized electronic requests for medical evidence of record (MER), patient authorization and respond to requests with structured medical information through a CCD(s).  SSA will also use the RFI responses to help develop a Request for Proposal that will lead to contracts for the implementation of the MEGAHIT project.  

SSA seeks information from industry for preliminary planning purposes ONLY.  This RFI will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the government’s requirement and to affirm that there is a general understanding of the requirement.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  

A detailed description of the project is contained in the attached DRAFT RFP.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  In addition, this effort will be funded with Recovery Act funds; therefore the solicitation will contain the clauses at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-5, Alternate II, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  Specifically, the following:

•52.203-15 – Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)
•52.204-11 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009)
•52.215-2 Alternate I, Audit and Records-Negotiation  


Responses from industry MUST be submitted via email to SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov by July 22, 2009.   No phone calls will be accepted.  The subject line of the submission should be “RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information to SSA through integration with the NHIN”.  Responses must include the following information: 

1. Company/Facility name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address. 

2. Type of healthcare organization (Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and/or Specialty Care Providers/Facilities). 

3. Does your company use an electronic health records system?   

4. Who is your electronic health records software vendor?

5. Does your company have experience in exchanging electronic health records?  If so, with whom?

6. What additional information from the Government would you need to develop a proposal?

7. Describe the risks associated with participating in this effort (business, operational, technical) and what actions could be taken to mitigate these risks?

8. If we issue a Request for Proposals, would you submit a proposal?  If not, why?

9. Do you have any other concerns/comments or recommendations regarding the Draft RFP or proposed acquisition approach? Specifically, we seek input on the following documents:

-Statement of Work (RFP Section B-1)
-Electronic Health Records Content Checklist (RFP Section E)
-SSA’s Implementation Guide (www.socialsecurity.gov/hit)
-Instructions to Offerors (RFP Section F)
-Proposed Evaluation Criteria (RFP Section G-1(d))


We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories offers access to its unique user facilities.

New proprietary and nonproprietary agreement forms require minimal, if any, negotiation and are quickly executable.

Sandia National Laboratories’ (www.sandia.gov) unique research facilities are available for use by U.S. industry, universities, academia, other laboratories, state and local governments, and the scientific community in general. 

The Department of Energy’s (DOE) new model agreements, one designated for proprietary research and the other for nonproprietary research, have simplified the process for gaining access to DOE facilities and promote smooth technology transfer from DOE laboratories. 

The proprietary agreement allows users access to laboratory equipment to perform commercial research. Proprietary users pay full cost recovery to Sandia through DOE. The nonproprietary agreement allows users to access equipment and facilities and to collaborate with laboratory scientists. Work must be noncommercial, precompetitive, basic science research. Nonproprietary users only pay the cost of their own research, and all data produced is made publically available.  

DOE has made Sandia’s Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) a designated science user facility. CINT will begin using the new proprietary and nonproprietary user agreements in the near future. For a number of other Sandia user facilities, known as Technology Deployment Centers, DOE is permitting the Labs to continue using the current User Facility Agreement. 

These facilities include the following: 

• Advanced Battery Research, Engineering, & Evaluation Facility
• Center for Security Systems; Combustion Research Facility
• Design, Evaluation and Test Technology Facility
• Electronic Technologies User Facility
• Engineering Sciences Experimental Facilities
• Explosive Components Facility
• Geomechanics Laboratory
• Intelligent Systems and Robotics Center
• Ion Beam Laboratory
• Materials and Process Diagnostics Facility
• Mechanical Test and Evaluation Facility
• National Solar Thermal Test Facility
• NUFAC Nuclear Facilities Resource Center
• Photovoltaic Laboratories
• Plasma Materials Test Facility
• Primary Standards Laboratory, Pulsed Power and Systems Validation Facility
• Radiation Detector Materials Characterization Laboratory
• Shock Thermodynamic Applied Research Facility

Baekaert is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability of this requirement.<BR><BR>The Concrete and Materials Branch (CMB), Geotechnical & Structures Laboratory (GSL), ERDC is currently supporting the Impact and Explosion Effects Branch (IEEB) by fabricating steel fiber reinforced ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) test articles.  The material is being evaluated for applications in protective structures and also for civil applications where long-term durability is crucial.  CMB has recently developed a generic UHPC material which is being extensively characterized and has become the next generation mixture in the production of UHPC mixtures for a variety of testing programs.  This generic UHPC uses specific constituent materials required to produce the material. The prescribed mixture proportion includes the use of particular steel fiber reinforcement, Dramix ZP 305. The Dramix ZP 305 fibers are made by the Bekaert Corporation, 1395 South Marietta Parkway, Marietta, GA 30067.

Travel management services are to be provided for authorized official travel performed by DoD travelers assigned to organizations in their respective Travel Areas. DoD has established approximately twenty-five (25) Travel Areas as Small Business Set-aside locations, five (5) of which are set-aside strictly for 8(a) qualified firms.  Award of multiple contracts from the solicitation is anticipated, with the potential to award one contract per Travel Area.  Multiple travel areas may be awarded under one contr act if doing so is in the best interest of the Government. The final RFP for this solicitation will be released in January 2004.   The Government anticipates awarding Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) with a two year base period and three, one year option periods.  Services will be priced on a transaction fee basis. Optional services will  be priced on a monthly basis.  The SIC Code is 561510 with annual size standard of $3,000.000. A best value source selection process will be conducted with each offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposal evaluated against Technical, Performance Risk and Price factors.  In making its final selection of contractors to perform CTO services, the Government's technical eva luation will include (but not be limited to) an assessment of offerors' demonstrated ability to perform CBA reconciliation. Interested vendors will be required to demonstrate their capability to validate passenger name record (PNR) data through their Global Distribution System  (GDS) to the Defense Travel System as a condition of receiving award of any requirement described in this notice.

<p>c. This "Disputes" clause does not preclude consideration of law questions in connection with decisions provided for in paragraph "a" above, provided, that nothing in this contract shall be construed as making final the decision of any administrative official, representative, or board on a question of law.</p>
<p>3. LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>
<p>5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (JAN 2005) - This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor<br />directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment.</p>
<p>6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.</p>
<p>b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.</p>
<p>c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the<br />effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2)below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any</p>
<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect<br />the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of<br />nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>

<p>17. TAXES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is<br />exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract<br />price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) - (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)</p>
<p>a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection,<br />and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be<br />provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.</p>
<p>20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) - Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement<br />is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified<br />payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):</p>
<p>a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:<br />(i) Invoice date;<br />(ii) Name of Contractor;<br />(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;<br />(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading);<br />(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);<br />(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and<br />(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:</p>
<p>(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and</p>

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial. Because fuel prices fluctuate, we will require the Offerors to submit a price per gallon of No 2 Diesel Fuel and 87 Octane Unleaded fuel using the current market pricing. Offerors shall use the RFQ format (attached to this solicitation) to submit their pricing.</p>
<p>(viii); FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items Evaluation. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price- The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes solely on the total price for the requirement.

The rate of each delivery will be based on Current Market Pricing as determined by Index published by AAA for Columbia, SC on the web site www.fuelgauge.com. The contractor must maintain the same ratio of bid price to published market price. For example, if the bid price is $2.40 for Regular Unleaded on 7 Sep and the market (AAA) rate is $2.505, the contractor is offering a discount ration of 4.2%. Therefore, all future prices for delivery must be at least 4.2% below the AAA published rate.</p>

SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with ScriptPro USA, Inc, 5828 Reeds Rd, Shawnee Mission, KS 66202, as the only responsible source that can provide a system that does not require medication dispensing cells to be shipped offsite for cleaning and calibration and can provide a picture of and physical description of the prescribed medication on the printed label attached to each individual vial.

The requirement is for a robotic prescription dispensing system.  The robotic prescription dispensing system shall be able to automatically select a prescription vial of the proper size, fill the vial with the proper medication and print and apply the correct prescription label directly to the filled vial.  The prescription label shall include standard prescription information, a bar code, USP auxiliary label as well as a picture of and physical description of the medication inside each prescription vial. The system shall use bar codes to confirm correct drug product and strength.  Vials shall be filled directly from drug dispensing cells to prevent cross-contamination.  The vial shall be collated and uncapped for the pharmacist to perform a final verification.  
The system shall have drug dispensing cells that can be cleaned and calibrated onsite by pharmacy technicians when changing the medication dispensed by the individual cells.  The system shall not require dispensing cells to be shipped offsite for cleaning and calibration prior to use with a new medication.  The system shall have a minimum of 200 drug dispensing cells, a minimum prescription filling speed of 150 prescriptions per hour, and allow for three separate vial sizes, from multiple manufacturers, to be loaded into the system at once.  The system shall use the Microsoft XP operating system.  The system shall also be capable of interfacing with CHCS and Centricity Software System as it becomes available.  The system shall be DITSCAP certified or have DITSCAP interim authority.  The total weight of the system shall not exceed 2600 lbs.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-34. This is a Set Aside for Small Business.   The NAICS is 541940.   The small business size standard is 7 million.  This RFQ will be awarded upon best value.  The statement of work for these services is as follows:
Statement of WorkVeterinary Support on Horse Management Operations
Veterinary support is required in working with feral horses and burros as part of horses and burro management operations on Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge See the Sheldon NWR Horse & Burro Management Environmental Assessment for description of program:http://www.fws.gov/sheldonhartmtn/sheldon/horseburro.html
Scheduled work will include drawing blood samples for Coggins testing and health certification, issuance of health certificates for adopted animals, treatment of injured animals, gelding (castration of studs), vasectomy, ovariectomy, and providing other miscellaneous treatments and supplies.  There is an inherent uncertainty on the quantities of each treatment depending on funding, availability of adoption homes and the nature of the work.  Therefore, a schedule of the cost will be provided with quote. Identification of horses to receive treatments will depend upon direction given by the Sheldon Refuge Manager, Project Leader, or other staff designated by the Sheldon Manager. The majority of work is conducted on the refuge, which is a remote location (2 hours from any significant developed areas) and under primitive conditions.  Much of the work is associated with large gathers or smaller capture operations, typically from September through February, but it could occur as early as July 1. The Contractor will need to work with staff and volunteers under the direction of the Sheldon Refuge Manager for handling horses in the refuge corrals and shute system.  Scheduling of the general processing work associated with a gather will need to be worked out to mutual agreement between the Sheldon Refuge Manager and the Contractor.  However, the contractor may be required to be available on phone or to come onsite for consultation on equine medical issues or emergencies.Itemized cost items include:   Travel to Refuge  Health Certificate & Coggins Test  Treatment of horse injuries and surgery  Blood sample collection  Euthanasia  Castration  Vasectomy  Ovariectomy  Other professional service, supplies Handling feral horses is inherently risky because of the wild nature of the animals.  This risk pertains to injury and death to animals, and injury to staff.  The program is also under significant scrutiny by the public and Congress.  The contracted vendor must demonstrate prior knowledge and experience in working with feral horses, and past performance in handling veterinary procedures with feral horses.  Successful results must be shown in handling large numbers of feral horses in a day (more than 50) for inspection, treatment, and testing.  Specialized procedures (vasectomy, ovariectomy) are likely to be required in primitive field conditions on a large number of horses (more than 50), and must have already demonstrated accomplishment with these procedures under field conditions with very low failure rates.
Contract bids will be evaluated based on best value, employing factors as cost, demonstrated knowledge experience, and successful past performance with feral horses.
Funds will be obligated this year, with the period of performance required periodically from August 20, 2009 through February 28, 2011.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for radio-labeled drug synthesis and imaging services.

General Duties/Description of Work

1) Project Title: PET Imaging for Drug Efficacy/Toxicity 

2) Statement of Need.
Background. Docetaxel has value in the treatment of several tumors, including breast and lung cancer. It would be especially desirable to identify those tumors that are likely to be sensitive to docetaxel in a disease such as breast cancer, because there are many alternative drugs that could be used if docetaxel were ineffective. Several determinants for the antitumor activity of docetaxel are known. However, the most readily investigated mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to docetaxel appear to be the steps of celluar uptake and efflux. Because the sensitivity of tumor cells to docetaxel is directly linked to the amount of drug that accumulates inside the cell, positron-labeled docetaxel might be useful as a probe for noninvasive external imaging of uptake and retention of docetaxel. The ability of tracer amounts of radiolabeled docetaxel to evaluate the net effect of these two transport steps with this single probe is potentially a powerful tool to improve response rates and decrease unnecessary toxicity by matching drugs to tumors. 

The Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology (LCP) at FDA developed a micro-synthesis demonstrating the feasibility of radiolabeling docetaxel and now allows the project to move to the next stage, preclinical studies using 11C-docetaxel including determination of dosimetry in rodents.


Statement of work. The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, services, materials, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of work as described below. LCP will be responsible for acquisition of the labeling precursors and non-labeled antitumor drugs.  

I.	The contractor shall work closely with the study liaison and project officer throughout the lifespan of the contract.

Background:

The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is seeking a contractor to produce 40 German cockroach-specific scFvs (single-chain fragment variable; a type of antibody), 40 Neurospora crassa-specific scFvs, 40 Agarigus bisporus-specific scFvs, and 40 Nicotiana benthamiana/excelsiana-specific scFvs. These four allergens will be provided to the contractor.  This work will be done as part of the development of the multiplex allergen extract potency assay (MAEPA).  The purpose of MAEPA is to assess the overall potency of complex allergen mixtures.  CBER is currently in the process of developing and optimizing MAEPA for less complex allergen mixtures and are ready to move into more complex mixtures such as the cockroach allergen extract. The development of this assay will be an important step towards analyzing the allergenicity of cockroach extract as well as many other extracts currently on the market that do not have a standard of potency.  We are also working to evaluate potential allergens that may exist and co-purify with vaccines produced in novel expression systems.  A human scFv library used to screen these extracts will be expected to enable us to find allergens relevant to humans.
 

I.	Scope of Work

General Duties/Description of Work - 


1.0	 Background

There has been an increase in the incidence of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) following cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation in recent years.  TASS is an acute sterile postoperative inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye and it is believed to be caused by toxic non-infectious substances.  Many causes have been implicated in its etiology.  One of the possible causes of TASS is believed to be bacterial endotoxin contamination of the intraocular lens and/or surgical adjuncts such as ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (materials with viscous and/or viscoelastic properties that are designed to create and maintain space, to protect intraocular tissues and to manipulate tissues during surgery in the anterior segment of the eye) and balanced salt solutions as well as surgical instruments used in surgery.  Existing endotoxin limits for intraocular devices are not based on scientific studies on endotoxin-induced ocular inflammation.  Instead, they are primarily based on experience with pharmaceutical products and devices that are intended for use in parts of the body other than the eye.  Reports in the literature have shown that the eye is exceptionally sensitive to endotoxins relative to other organs.  It is, therefore, necessary to develop endotoxin limits for ophthalmic devices based on the results of appropriate scientific studies to assure product biocompatibility.

In 2007, FDA completed a study on the ocular reactivity of bacterial endotoxins contained in water.  The results of this study have not been published.  The results show that intracameral injection of water containing very low levels of endotoxins elicited transient inflammation in the rabbit eye.  The results were presented at an ISO (International Standards Organization) meeting on ophthalmic implants in April of 2008.  Industry representatives at the meeting questioned the applicability of this data to the presence of the same amounts of endotoxins in ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVDs) because the physical characteristics of OVDs may limit the availability of the endotoxins to the eye.  It is therefore necessary to evaluate the ocular reactivity to endotoxins contained in OVDs of various rheological properties that are currently on the market.  In addition, it is necessary to examine the two different test methods currently used by industry to evaluate the inflammatory potential of OVDs.  These methods are: 1) intravitreal and 2) intracameral injections in the rabbit.  The intracameral injection method in the rabbit was found to be highly sensitive in detecting endotoxins in the FDA study and a similar study conducted by Japanese investigators.  A manuscript on the results of the Japanese study has been submitted to the Japanese Journal of Ophthalmology. The intravitreal injection method used by some OVD manufacturers has not been adequately validated.  A side-by-side comparison of the two methods would help identify the more sensitive/reproducible method of testing, which would enable FDA to establish appropriate guidance for industry in preclinical testing of OVDs.  The data generated from the two studies will ultimately support U.S. and international endotoxin limit development for OVDs and other non-solid intraocular devices such as endotamponades.  

The two studies are being contracted out to an outside laboratory because of space limitation at the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL). 


2.0	 Description of Work

The Contractor (Test Lab) shall conduct the two studies in the rabbit as follows:

Study 1- Inflammation Potential of Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices (OVDs)

The objective of this study is to evaluate the inflammatory potential of six (6) commercial OVDs, some of them are believed to contain sufficient amounts of endotoxins to elicit ocular inflammation.  A total of thirty (30) New Zealand White rabbits (male or female) weighing approximately 3 Kg each will be used in the study.  Five (5) rabbits will be randomly placed into each of the 6 treatment (commercial OVD) groups.   Ten (10) eyes of five (5) rabbits with normal eyes, as confirmed by slit lamp biomicroscopy, will be intracamerally injected (directly into the anterior chamber of the eye) with each of the six (6) OVDs.  The treated eyes will be examined for signs of inflammation by slit lamp biomicroscopy at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48 and 72 hours after injection.  

Slit lamp observations should include, but not limited to, the conjunctiva, cornea, iris, cells, flare and fibrin reaction in the anterior chamber, presence of any synechia, pupil constriction, keratic precipitates, hypopyons, and fibrin clot beyond the pupillary area.  Observations on the conjunctiva, cornea and iris shall be graded using the McDonald Shadduck slit lamp grading scale (McDonald TO and JA Shadduck.  Eye irritation.  Dermatotoxicity and Pharmacology.  Eds. FN Marzuli and HI Maibach. 1977;4:162-166).  Observations on cells and flare should be graded in accordance with the SUN scale (Standardization of uveitis nomenclature for reporting clinical data.  Results of the first international workshop.  Am J Ophthalmol 2005;140:509-516).  Observations on fibrin should be grading as described in an article by R. Zarei and co-investigators (Zarei R, Azimi R, Moghimi S. et al.  Inhibition of intraocular fibrin formation after infusion of low-molecular weight heparin during combined phacoemulsification-trabeculectomy surgery.  J Cataract Refract Surg 2006; 32:1921-1925).

The rabbits will be released from the study after the 72-hour examination.  All the raw data collected will be compiled in tables and provided to FDA as hard copies and electronically on CDs.  The data sent to FDA will be sent using a trackable carrier service with a signature required upon delivery.  

 
Study 2- Comparison of Intracameral and Intravitreal Injection for the Testing of Inflammatory Potential of Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices (OVDs)

The objective of this study is to compare two different intraocular test methods, intracameral and intravitreal injection in the rabbit, for testing of the inflammatory potential of OVDs.  A total of thirty (30) New Zealand White rabbits (male or female) weighing approximately 3 Kg each will be used in the study.  Five (5) rabbits will be randomly placed into each of the 6 treatment (commercial OVD) groups.   Ten (10) eyes of five (5) rabbits with normal eyes, as confirmed by slit lamp biomicroscopy, will be intracamerally injected (directly into the anterior chamber of the eye) with each of three OVDs of known endotoxin concentrations.  Ten (10) eyes of five (5) rabbits with normal eyes, as confirmed by slit lamp biomicroscopy, will be intravitreally injected (directly into the vitreous of the eye) with each of the same three OVDs.   The treated eyes will be examined for signs of inflammation using slit lamp biomicroscopy at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48 and 72 hours after injection.  The grading of the slit lamp observations will be the same as what is described for Study 1.  

The rabbits will be released from the study at the end of the 72-hour examination.  All the raw data collected will be compiled in tables and provided to FDA as hard copies and electronically on CDs.  The data sent to FDA will be sent using a trackable carrier service with a signature required upon delivery.  


The Contractor (Test Lab) shall:
 	
1.	Provide the necessary number of rabbits for use in the two studies.  Each study requires that 30 New Zealand White rabbits weighing approximately 3 Kg be successfully injected with the test materials (with no surgical trauma that could confound the study findings) and monitored for the duration of the study.  Purchase an additional six (6) animals to hold on reserve in the event that any of the study animals expire unexpectedly during the term of the study.  

2.House the animals in the facility at least 1 week prior to the procedures and during the entire term of the study.

3.Prepare an animal care and use protocol for conducting the studies listed above and obtain approval to conduct the studies.  

4.	Adhere to the laboratory’s internal procedures regarding animal welfare and care.

5.

6.	Provide adequately trained personnel for animal husbandry, food and water and daily care of the rabbits during their assignment to the study protocol and to assist with all stages of the surgery and pre- and post-treatment evaluation.

7.	Provide all housing and husbandry needs, including food and water and health care needs for the animals during the acclimation and study period.

8.Provide all medications needed for the studies including anesthetics (ketamine/xylazine, proparacaine HCl) and medication (0.3% gentamicin drops) as needed after injection and all other surgical supplies, such as injection syringes and needles as needed.

9.	Humanely dispose of the study animals at the end of the two studies either by re-assigning them to other studies with approved protocols or have the rabbits humanely euthanized in accordance with the current guidelines for euthanasia of rabbits.  See guidelines provided in: AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (Formerly Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia) June 2007 (http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf).

10.	Compile the data and provide FDA with all the raw data (including animal records, lab notebooks, and animal room environmental data) and summary data upon completion of each study.  

11.	Allow FDA technical staff to observe treatment and post-treatment examination of the study rabbits and make study modifications as deemed necessary.  FDA requires a minimum of five (5) rabbits per group per study as described above.

The feasibility assessment should be a clear and complete analysis of the impact associated with expanding the option as a program requirement, however, RMA does not want the contractor to provide a specific recommendation, but rather to lay out all the issues to consider and weigh regarding any decision to make the pilot program part of the program requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. ***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-33 (Effective 7/15/2009). ***  

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. ***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a 100 MHz NMR Probe. ***

The 100 MHz NMR in the Polymers Division has traditionally been used to study polymers and polymer blends via the 13C nucleus. This has been done primarily with a home-built, room-temperature 1H-13C NMR sample probe. The main purpose of this acquisition is to allow for experiments to be performed over a large range of sample temperatures (-150oC to 100oC), and enable cutting-edge photo-coupled NMR experiments to be performed on conjugated polymers and polymer blends which are candidates for plastic solar cells. NIST envisions performing low temperature (-150°C) NMR experiments with in situ photoirradiation in order to study photo-induced electron-nuclear interactions in polymers that are candidates for organic photovoltaics. 

In order to perform these new experiments, NIST seeks to upgrade the sample probe capabilities in the current 100 MHz spectrometer configuration. NIST wishes to acquire a sample probe that will allow for the collection of 1H and 13C spectra over a wide range of sample temperatures (-150°C to +100°C) and allow for high intensity light that matches the solar spectrum at the sample space. The experiments envisioned are similar to those reported in Matysik et al., Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2000, 37, 418-423.  Any modifications to the current set-up as a result of this procurement should not deteriorate or disable the current functionality of the spectrometer as described above.

*** Line Item 0001 is a partial BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement. Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency’s needs.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued.  The U. S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA on behalf of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) has a requirement for the acquisition of H1N1 vaccine. The Government anticipates one FFP award, however it reserves the right to make multiple awards or no award. The contractor will produce and vial Good Manufacturing Process pDNA using the VCL-10551 plasmid that encodes swine-origin influenza virus (SOIV) strain A/California/04/09 (H1N1) hemagglutin (H1 pDNA). Test lots of the pDNA must be adjuvanted with Vaxfectin and tested in mice and rabbits using needle and syringe delivery and demonstrate immunogenicity in both species via a hemmagglutin inhibition assay. The contractor must prepare and submit an IND application for a H1 pDNA-Vaxfectin vaccine to the FDA and must agree to serve as the sponsor of a Phase I clinical trial in humans. The contractor must also develop an immunoassay to evaluate human clinical samples. The reason that both Vaxfectin(r) and VCL-10551 must be used is that they have already shown safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in animals and humans in an H5 influenza vaccine under an Investigational New Drug (IND) Phase I clinical trial by standard needle and syringe delivery methods. Vaxfectin(r) has also been shown to enhance immune responses in other DNA vaccines. Therefore, the purpose of the work to be performed under this contract is to rapidly produce a novel H1 DNA-Vaxfectin vaccine and IND for the purpose of assessing safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in a Phase I clinical trial. The potential total contract value is estimated $1,250,000 over a one year period. The estimated start date is September 2009. This procurement is a 100% small business set aside under NAICS code 325414. The small business size standard for this procurement is a firm with average monthly employee count, including all affiliates, for the last 12 months not in excess of 500 employees. The Request-For-Proposals (RFP)is attached to this announcement. Although the attached RFP states that proposals must be received by 08/15/2009, offerors have UNTIL 02:00 PM EST ON MONDAY, 08/17/2009 to submit proposals; proposals should be submitted electronically via email to david.w.mark@us.army.mil.  Proposals received after 02:00 PM EST ON MONDAY, 08/17/2009 will not be considered. Any questions must be sent via e-mail to david.w.mark@us.army.mil. No phone calls or FAXes will be accepted. The acquisition is utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>

The following factors are arranged in order of importance and shall be used to evaluate offers: a) Technical Capability to furnish a product conforming to MIL Spec MIL-P-85891A (TYPE VII) and the recycle/disposal of spent blast media demonstrating a true cradle to grave process; b) Delivery; c) Price; d) Past Performance. Factors a) through d) are arranged in order of importance. Technical Capability is of primary importance and includes two parts: 1) ability to provide the required conforming product or acceptable equal product and 2) the recycle/disposal process for spent blast media.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Incumbent conceptualizes, designs, coordinates, implements, and disseminates basic program evaluations. Incumbent is expected to establish and maintain close relationship with all international development partner representatives and GOM officials working in M&amp;E on behalf of CDC to ensure consistency and harmony of results reporting and to develop shared languages around indicator design, selection and implementation. Incumbent also participates in the collaboration and coordination of activities with other international partners present in country (e.g., World Health Organizations, UNAIDS, Global Fund (GF), and World Bank) on areas related to the development of targets and indicator measurements and other M&amp;E system activities.</p>

<p>Selection Factors:</p>
<p>The applicant that represents the best value to the Government will be considered for award. To determine best value, the following factors will be considered:</p>
<p>1. The extent an applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications based on information obtained through the application package and interviews, if conducted. Note that interviews may or may not be conducted; therefore, the application package should clearly identify how well the applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications of this position. Interviews, if conducted, may be either in-person or via telephone.</p>
<p>2. Information collected from reference checks. References will only be verified for those applicants determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<DESC>The following amendment hereby responds to questions received in response to the subject solicitation.

Question 1)      Are there any humidity requirements?  Is so what is the humidity range?

Answer 1) The humidity requirements are already listed.   See item 6

Question 2) Is the 81inch height requirement for move in only, or is this the maximum height allowable in the chambers final resting spot? (#2)

Answer 2) Actually it’s for move-in only.  

Question 3) Is NIST supplying the floor rails?  (#5)

Answer 3) Yes.

Question 4)  What is the load inside the chamber, size, material type, weight and if any heat dissipation?  Or shall we consider the heating and cooling rate with the chamber empty? (#12)

Answer 4) Support (and thus weight) requirement is given in 5.  Pressure vessel going inside the chamber is roughly 16 inches diameter, 22 inches long, of 304 Stainless steel with wall thickness nominally .105 inches.  Within this pressure vessel is a cylinder that is 14 inch diameter and 16 inches long, constructed of .048 thick stainless steel.  There are sealing surfaces on the outer pressure vessel that are of 304 SS.   NIST is going to actively heat / cool the vessel, so that it is very close to the chamber temperature.  So we don’t need to consider the vessel in the heating and cooling rate spec.  In other words, the spec is for an empty chamber.

Question 5) What is the temperature range for the heating and cooling rate? (#12)

Answer 5) Over the entire temperature range specified in 7.

Question 6) Is there a test profile that you are typically running? (#12)

Answer 6) No.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide written answers to&nbsp;several questions that have been submitted by potential offerors.&nbsp; These questions, along with responses to them can be found below.</p>
<p>Q: What is the CheckPoint account number that these products will be going into?</p>
<p>A: The CheckPoint Account Number that the required products will be going into is Account Number 0005241093.</p>
<p>Q: You indicate that you are looking at both co-termed and 12 months support. I'm assuming by that, that you mean you would like to know what the yearly cost will be going forward for maintenance. Do you mean for that particular item only? Or for the entire account?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; With regards to co-terming the maintenance: the intention of NIST is to co-term maintenance on all new items with our existing CheckPoint maintenance, which expires on 02/28/2010, and also purchase an additional year of maintenance for the new items (03/01/2010 - 02/28/2011).</p>
<p>Q: I notice that you will be trading in a CPMP-SCPRO-U-NG among others. Will you be managing the firewalls from a central server or will you be managing them separately? If you will be managing them centrally, you will need to split a management SKU to keep the SmartCenter so this can be done.</p>
<p>A: NIST will be managing firewalls from a central server using the CheckPoint Smart-1 (25 site) devices that are included in this procurement.</p>

All services include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series.

Project Summary:  The NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) is located on the Suitland Federal Center (SFC) in Suitland, Maryland.  The NSOF building was designed by the renowned architect, Thom Mayne, of Morphosis.  In the NSOF bulding, Mayne included architectural design principles that prioritize open spaces, reduce the presence of built-form and integrate the architecture into the landscape. He received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2005. The property itself has received several design awards, including the 2002 GSA Design Award, 2003 AIA/LA Award, and 2004 Progressive Architecture Citation.  GSA submitted this property for rating by the US Green Building Council and has received the Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating. 

The purpose of this project is to perform a laser scan of a portion of the NOAA facility which contains building equipment and develop a facility management BIM model.  Current GSA procedures do not adequately capture required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities via GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS).  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

Objectives for this BIM Solicitation:  

-  To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions for a single section of 
the NOAA facility. The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for verification and comparison of spatial data and area measurements. The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces. 

-  To generate a point cloud of the building interior and exterior for applications such as spatial data management, visualization, and facility management.	
-  To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services such as Fire, HVAC, Data/Communications, Security, and Lighting that may be utilized for building operation.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation and building operations and maintenance activities.

-  To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

-  To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA’s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

Deliverables:  The contractor shall provide the deliverables specified in the SOW (See attachment).

Period of Performance:  The period of performance for the contract will be for a period not to exceed 12 months.  If required, a 6-month extension may be exercised in accordance with FAR Part 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  

Price Schedule:  The Contractor shall complete Appendix A, Pricing Schedule and submit under Volume I of their proposal.    

Evaluation Criteria:  The contractor will be evaluated on the criteria stated in Appendix C, Evaluation Criteria.  When combined, technical is more important than price.  The evaluation criteria are (in order of importance):

1)	Technical
2)	Personnel and Experience
3)	Past Performance
4)	Price

Submission of Proposals:  The contractor shall submit their questions on or before 12:00p, 12:00pm, E.S.T., Wednesday, August 12, 2009.

<DESC>This amendment to W52H09-09-T-VB02 is to:<BR><BR>1.  Extend the response date to 14 August 2009.<BR><BR>2.  To provide question/answer information.<BR><BR>Q&A is as follows:<BR><BR>1.  Q: Will we be thrown out if we take exception to the rain part of the RFQ?<BR>A: No, the rain part of the chamber is an option if the manufacturer can supply it.<BR><BR>2.  Q: Is panelized construction OK?<BR>A: Yes, as long as it is suitable for outdoor conditions.<BR><BR>3.  Q: Is explosion resistant OK, or do they require classification?<BR>A: Explosion proof is not a requirement.<BR><BR>4.  Q: Combustion air will be needed, how much intake air is required, and where will it come from?  What are the conditions of the intake air?<BR>A: Contractor needs to provide air intake and exhaust ports on the chamber walls, combustion air will be routed through a heat exchanger (Government furnished) inside the chamber to pre-condition the air prior to entering into the engine.<BR><BR>5.  Q: What kind of floor load support is required in pounds per square foot?<BR>A: The chamber floor must accomodate a 6K fork lift with a 4K load.<BR><BR>6.  Q: How often will personnel be entering/exiting the chamber during operation and at what temperatures?<BR>A: Personnel entering/exiting the chamber could be as high as 6 times per hour at all temperature ranges.<BR><BR>7.  Q: Is TACOM providing HC/CO Detectors or is that a requirement of the supplier?<BR>A: The manufacturer would be required to provide the detector.<BR><BR>8.  Q: Is TACOM providing Fire Suppression or a Sprinkler System in this chamber, which we assume would be considered an occupied space?<BR>A: If fire code requires it, the manufacturer would be expected to provide it.<BR><BR>9. Q: Is explosion proof lighting required?<BR>A: No, but waterproof is required.<BR><BR>10. Q: Is this chamber indoors or outdoors?<BR>A: Outdoors on a concrete or gravel pad.<BR><BR>11. Q: Does the installation location have process water available for condenser cooling or is air cooling required?<BR>A: Final location of the chamber is to be determined.  Please provide air cooling as an option.<BR><BR>12. Q: What type and purity of humidity supply water is available?<BR>A: The water supply will be the local city water, therefore the manufacturer will need to provide filtering to improve the water quality, as well as some thermo projection for the humidity system when not in operation during the winter or when using the chamber cooling modes to avoid freezing of the humidity equipment.<BR><BR>13.  Q: Please specify the maximum CFM of Air that the Engines will consume to allow for proper makeup of air.<BR>A: If engine operational tests are conducted while the chamber is running, a heat exchanger will be installed in line with the engine intake to precondition the air prior to entering the engine, the chamber manufacture needs to provide 5 inch diameter engine air intake and exhaust ports thru the chamber walls.<BR><BR>14. Q: What is the largest horsepower engine that is being operated inside the chamber and is it required to maintain the set point temperature while running?<BR>A: It's envisioned that the largest gas or diesel engine tested<BR>would be 50 HP and yes the chamber needs to maintain set point during testing.<BR><BR>If there are any other questions on this matter, please contact Nicole Kirchgesner at nicole.kirchgesner@us.army.mil or 309.782.0449<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Question 14: Does a State of Texas HUB Certified contractor meet the HUBZone requirements for this solicitation?</p>
<p>Government Ressponse: The HUB Zone Empowerment Contracting Program stimulates economic development and creates jobs in urban and rural communities by providing Federal contracting preferences to small businesses. These preferences go to small businesses that obtain HUB Zone (Historically Underutilized Business Zone) certification in part by employing staff who live in a HUBZone. The company must also maintain a "principal office" in one of these specially designated areas. A principal office can be different from a company headquarters. <br /><br />The program resulted from provisions contained in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. This office (37th Contracting Squadron) will use the following SBA Website to validate if a Firm is a Certified Hub Zone Company: http://www.sba.gov/hubzone/</p>

The GMD Weapon System is a complex system of systems that consists of hardware and software, including Ground Based Interceptors (GBIs), GBI silos, and related flight and ground test equipment; Launch Site Components, Command Launch Equipment, and related Peculiar Support Equipment; the Re-locatable In-Flight Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminal (IDT); and tactical/non-tactical communications equipment and support facilities that are geographically dispersed across the globe.

MDA in Huntsville, Alabama, is the contracting activity for this requirement.  As a part of the acquisition-planning process, MDA intends to engage industry in one-on-one Business/Contracts meetings to inform industry of changes in MDA Contracting Office and to introduce the new MDA Contracting Officer, the Director of GMD Contracts, and the Deputy Director of GMD Contracts responsible for acquisition oversight of this effort.  These one-on-one discussions are scheduled for 18-20 August 2009.   The Government does not intend to address any technical questions during these one-on-one meetings.  The Government will, however, be open to discussions from industry in regard to contract type; period of performance; and any additional input which would assist the Government in refining a business/contracting strategy for the acquisition of future GMD system Performance Based Logistics.   

Except as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; the Government does not intend to pay for any costs incurred as a result of this notice or any resultant one-on-one meetings.

Statement of Work
Transitioning Key Technologies to the Operational Users
1. BACKGROUND 
There is a broad understanding in the national security community that the future of conflict is likely to differ considerably from prior examples of traditional warfare. The broad consensus is that the "future face of warfare" or "Irregular Warfare (IW)" will be characterized as follows. First, IW is as strategically important as traditional warfare. Second, IW subsumes several key operations and activities (e.g., counterinsurgency, counter-terrorism, strategic communication, information operations, cyber operations). Third, the focus of IW operations is a relevant population. Fourth, IW activities must be synchronized with the efforts of key Government Agencies, foreign security partners, International organizations, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. Thus, it must address Interagency and "Whole of Government" issues. Finally, IW depends upon our understanding of human and social dynamics. Thus, a major challenge is to create and transition key planning tools to the operational user that will enable him to deal with the "future face of warfare".
2. OBJECTIVE A.   The Department of Defense (DoD) has the requirement to enhance the timely injection of key planning tools to the operational users.
B. The successful transition of these key technologies will require the development of enhanced methods, tools, data, services (e.g., Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A)), and intellectual capital (e.g., education and training).
C. Given the "face of future warfare", it is critical to deal with the problem from an Interagency and "Whole of Government" perspective.
3. TASKS
A.  Organize and Contribute to Workshops to Enhance the Transition of Key Planning Tools to the Operational Users. Activities will be undertaken to help organize, execute, and document workshops that address the challenges associated with transitioning innovative planning tools to operational users. First, efforts will be undertaken to help structure the workshop (e.g., develop Terms of Reference; develop the structure of the workshops; identify the workshop participants; support the generation of "use cases"). Second, steps will be taken to help implement the workshop (e.g., chair the synthesis panel to generate a holistic perspective of the workshop). Finally, reports will be prepared that document the key findings and recommendations from the workshops. 
B.  Support a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) to Facilitate the Transition of Key Planning Tools to the Operational User. Activities will be pursued to provide expert advice on a proposed JCTD to identify and transition planning tools to support the operational user. These efforts will include providing assistance in: developing an architecture for integrating proposed planning tools; identifying and implementing a VV&A process to provide an independent assessment of the integrated tools. In addition, assistance will be provided to support the execution of the JCTD.
C.  Participate in a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) activity to support Science and Technology (S&T) efforts to create new tools to support operational planning. Activities will include assistance in structuring the MURI activity; performance of background research for the selected regions of interest; and assistance in the assessment of proposed S&T efforts.
D.  Perform additional tasks and duties associated with the creation and transition of new planning tools to the operational user. These include interacting with Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) (e.g., discussions with the Joint Irregular Warfare Center (JIWC)) and coordinating with related Interagency and "Whole of Government" initiatives (e.g., the Human, Social, Cultural Behavior Modeling Test Bed).
4. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
A.  A minimum of 10 years experience working with Science and Technology issues, especially with regard to the Department of Defense, national security, and IW operations is highly desirable.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT #A0900000800.
- General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF, Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format, and drawings will be available in TIFF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent.
- Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is an on-line system that is located on the Internet. Prior to ORCA, vendors were required to submit Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) for each individual large purchase contract award. Now, using ORCA, a contractor can enter their Reps and Certs information once for use on all Federal contracts. This site not only benefits the contractor by allowing them to maintain an accurate and complete record but also the Contracting Officer as they can view every record, including archives, with the click of a mouse. The ORCA site can be found by going to http://www.bpn.gov and clicking on "Online Reps and Certs Application" on the left side of the screen. If you do not have access to the Internet or feel you need extra Internet help please contact the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) (www.dla.mil/db/procurem.htm) closest to you.  You are strongly encouraged to register in ORCA in responding to this solicitation. You are required to have an active registration in CCR in order to conduct business with the Federal Government.
- Proposed Solicitation Issue Date: July 28, 2009
-Proposal receipt date (response date of 8/24/09) is approximate; the actual proposal due date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
- Title of Project:  Land Restoration and Vegetation Clearing
- Description:  The work of this contract will restore formerly developed areas of Everglades National Park. Over 7,000 acres of Everglades National Park consists of formerly developed land that was once farmed, graded and filled for roads or filled for some other purpose. Local agricultural practices included rock plowing, which breaks up underlying bedrock and dramatically alters soil structure. Agricultural fields were often heavily fertilized, resulting in nutrient rich soils, not at all typical of the very nutrient-poor Everglades. In south Florida, previously farmed or filled areas rapidly fill up with dense communities of exotic plants. The drained, artificially nutrient-enriched soils on these sites support such luxuriant plant growth that management of exotics in these areas is impractical. The park has developed techniques for restoring former agricultural or filled sites that restore natural conditions, promote native vegetation communities and minimize the need for ongoing exotic plant control. Over 3000 acres of previously farmed land in the Hole-in-the-Donut area of the park has already been successfully restored using these techniques. Many of the additional areas to be restored are in the East Everglades addition lands, though others are scattered throughout the park.
- Type of Procurement: One or more negotiated fixed price construction indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) with one base year and four option years will be considered for award requiring submission of both a technical proposal and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
- Estimated price range: $15 million (over 5 years)
-NAICS code: 238910
- All responsible 8(a) program participants may submit an offer that will be considered.  THIS IS AN 8(a) COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.
- It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.

<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-10-1001
<RESPDATE>072209
<CONTACT>Syreeta  Gay, Email SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  Response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to exchange information with industry related to its efforts to improve the speed and quality of its Disability Determination Process.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for the Nation’s two primary Federal Disability Programs: Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.  Due to the significant growth in disability applications over the last 5 years, the increased complexity of those applications, limited resources, medical advances, changing health information technology, and outdated policies, our ability to process disability applications have fallen short of our own expectations.  We request an estimated 15-20 million medical records each year from healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, physicians, psychologists, and other health professionals) across the country to obtain evidence of an individual’s medical condition.  Providing medical records is very labor-intensive and expensive for healthcare facilities.  In addition, some facilities require the use of their own forms and some do not respond to our requests for medical records at all.  As a result, we are forced to obtain and retain paper originals of authorization forms and in some instances schedule consultative examinations when medical sources do not respond to our requests.  The current process results in significant burdens on applicants, providers, and the government.  

OBJECTIVE: While there is no single solution to improve our disability determination process; one of SSA’s proposed solutions is to expand our current Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health Information Technology (MEGAHIT) project by recruiting additional health care providers and networks to automate the exchange of medical records.  Automating the solution for Release of Information will save time and money for the providers and will also make SSA’s decision determination process more efficient and effective.  To achieve this goal, SSA contemplates awarding fixed price contracts to expand the number of healthcare providers participating in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN).  This will be done through a full and open, competitive, fixed-price request for proposal (RFP) contracting process.  SSA hopes to award contracts to organizations representing Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and Specialty Care Providers/Facilities. This effort will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds and payment will be made to awarded contractors upon successful completion of the implementation and successful response to several production requests from SSA with the transmission of verified Continuity of Care Documents (CCD).

Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to gauge interest of healthcare providers willing to participate in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), develop the capability to receive standardized electronic requests for medical evidence of record (MER), patient authorization and respond to requests with structured medical information through a CCD(s).  SSA will also use the RFI responses to help develop a Request for Proposal that will lead to contracts for the implementation of the MEGAHIT project.  

SSA seeks information from industry for preliminary planning purposes ONLY.  This RFI will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the government’s requirement and to affirm that there is a general understanding of the requirement.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  

A detailed description of the project is contained in the attached DRAFT RFP.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  In addition, this effort will be funded with Recovery Act funds; therefore the solicitation will contain the clauses at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-5, Alternate II, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  Specifically, the following:

•52.203-15 – Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)
•52.204-11 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009)
•52.215-2 Alternate I, Audit and Records-Negotiation  


Responses from industry MUST be submitted via email to SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov by July 22, 2009.   No phone calls will be accepted.  The subject line of the submission should be “RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information to SSA through integration with the NHIN”.  Responses must include the following information: 

1. Company/Facility name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address. 

2. Type of healthcare organization (Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and/or Specialty Care Providers/Facilities). 

3. Does your company use an electronic health records system?   

4. Who is your electronic health records software vendor?

5. Does your company have experience in exchanging electronic health records?  If so, with whom?

6. What additional information from the Government would you need to develop a proposal?

7. Describe the risks associated with participating in this effort (business, operational, technical) and what actions could be taken to mitigate these risks?

8. If we issue a Request for Proposals, would you submit a proposal?  If not, why?

9. Do you have any other concerns/comments or recommendations regarding the Draft RFP or proposed acquisition approach? Specifically, we seek input on the following documents:

-Statement of Work (RFP Section B-1)
-Electronic Health Records Content Checklist (RFP Section E)
-SSA’s Implementation Guide (www.socialsecurity.gov/hit)
-Instructions to Offerors (RFP Section F)
-Proposed Evaluation Criteria (RFP Section G-1(d))

10. Though contracts awarded as a result of a Request for Proposals will not include payment for the receipt of medical information, what would you consider a fair price (based on actual costs incurred) for your company to provide a patient's medical information in response to our request for medical information, assuming that the process is entirely automated?  Please explain the rationale for your answer.

11. Should we adjust the price over time? If so, what price is fair in the short-term? What price is fair in the long-term?  Please explain the rationale for your answer (including how you would define short-term).

We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<DESC>Questions and Clarifications Round 2
Amendment 2
USAID Solicitation # 383-09-503
USAID Title: Management, Team Building and Leadership Training Workshop

1) Can you tell us the number of contractors that inquired about this program?
ANSWER: Information regarding other interested parties is unavailable at this stage of the procurement.

2) What percentage of those who inquired were from the United States?
ANSWER: See question #1.

3) Have you determined what hotel will be used outside of the capital for the 3 day program? If so can you tell us the name and location? This would be helpful in assisting us in calculating our hotel expenses.
ANSWER: The hotel has not been selected yet.

4) Can you tell us if the last week of October could be an option and would work for the staff there?
ANSWER: The preference is early November.

5) Will anyone from DC Headquarters of USAID or the State Department be attending this program?
ANSWER: No

6) Can we assume that you have a preferred hotel in Colombo that you suggest visitor use? If so, can you tell us what hotel that would be.
ANSWER: Our visitors usually stay at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel or The Galle Face Hotel which is in close proximity to the office. However, it is at the discretion of the contractor to select where to stay.

7)  Under the “background” section of the SOW, it states there will be a 3-day workshop and an in-house half-a-day session for each of the five offices. Our understanding is that in addition to the 3-day workshop for 50 staff, that separate half-day sessions will be held with each of 5 Mission offices over a period of an additional 3 days, for a total of 6 training days.  Please confirm that this is correct.
ANSWER: That is correct.

8)  The Agency is undergoing change both internally and in its relationship with the State Dept. In the background section, the SOW mentions "changes in the agency and our programming." In order to better understand the requirement, should this project assist in addressing specifics related to those changes, or in preparing to deal with “managing change” at the Mission level effectively, or both?  Is the timing of this training tied to specific USAID changes, directives or requirements that the Mission is responding to?
ANSWER:  Both. It is tied to general changes.

9)  The SOW says the "contractor should discuss with each office director what session to include."  If so, how do we propose a design if this is supposed to happen after the contract is awarded?  Does this mean that the contractor must be prepared to arrive on site and to conduct interviews in person, or to interact with each Mission office director through email or telephone interviews, or both?  
ANSWER: Broad outline could be proposed and specifics, as required, could be incorporated through e-mail correspondence with the office directors.

10)  Again, the SOW says "specific outcomes and agenda will be developed as part of the process of planning the workshop, and shall work collaboratively with the mission to identify issues that are of specific concern to USAID/Sri Lanka." Does that mean the design in the proposal should incorporate this development as part of the process of the assignment?
ANSWER: Specific outcomes and agenda will be developed after the award. Please see answer #9

11) The Mission-wide program is to include coaching.  Does this include providing learning so that manager/leaders can effectively coach their employees? 
ANSWER: Coaching could be included as a topic, and not necessarily to coach the employees.

12) The requirement mentioned both management and leadership. How does the mission distinguish between leadership and management? 
ANSWER: 	Leadership:	1) capacity to lead.
		2) the act or an instance of leading.	
                     Management:	1) the act or art of managing: the conducting or supervising              of something (as a business).
	                     2) judicious use of means to accomplish an end.

13) The Mission-wide training requirement appears to include a number of methodologies, including various exercises and other interactive approaches for up to 50 persons.  Such exercises are normally conducted with far fewer numbers. Yet the RFP speaks in terms of “the consultant.”  Please address the issue of how many trainer/facilitators the contractor is expected to provide. 
ANSWER: Contractor could propose the number of trainers/facilitators as required to conducting both the in-house training and the workshop.

14)  Are there any page limits for the technical proposal?  If so, please define what can be included within the page limits in terms of charts, graphs, tables of contents, CVs, past performance, etc.
ANSWER: There is no page limit. However, excessive documentation is neither necessary nor wanted.

15)  In the technical proposal, in addition to the proposed approach and experience of the consultant, should any other topics be addressed such as understanding of the problem, institutional past performance or experience?
ANSWER: The proposed approach and experience of the consultant is sufficient.

16)  If indeed we can/should provide more than a single consultant, will the requirement that the instructor/consultant be a qualified U.S. citizen be fulfilled if the Lead Trainer is a U.S. citizen, supported by a trainer/facilitator who is not a U.S. citizen?
ANSWER: Only the Lead Trainer/consultant is required to be a qualified U.S. citizen.

17) Please provide an explanation of how the proposals will be evaluated in terms of importance of approach, qualification of trainer(s), institutional experience and performance, and between technical and cost.
ANSWER: USAID shall take into consideration the proposed approach, experience of the Lead Trainer/consultant and the cost to arrive at the best value to the Government.

18)  Although this is a Firm Fixed-Price contract, will EBDs be necessary to support staff costs?
ANSWER: The EBDs are required to ascertain the reasonableness of costs proposed.

19)  Please confirm that the off-site workshop will be held at a resort hotel that is selected by USAID, not the contractor, and that USAID will pick up all associated costs for the USAID participants, including their travel and per diem associated with the training.  Put another way, is USAID expecting the contractor to include any of these kinds of costs in its proposal?  
ANSWER:  The resort hotel will be selected by USAID. All costs incurred for the participants including the workshop facilities, lodging and travel will be borne by USAID. 

20)  Can USAID provide guidance on or a maximum amount on cost that they are anticipating for this activity?
ANSWER:  A maximum amount has not been established.

21) Will USAID be providing copies of “Strength Finder” with access codes for the associated on-line instrument?  Or should that be included in the proposal and therefore assume all employees will require a copy?
ANSWER: All employees have been given a copy of the “Strength Finder” book.

22) Does the mission-wide training include supervisory and non-supervisory personnel?
ANSWER: Yes.

23) Do the tailored office-trainings include supervisory and non-supervisory personnel?
ANSWER: The same employees are attending both training sessions.

24) Are there any restrictions on the type of interaction that can occur in the training due to participants religions or cultural backgrounds?
Answer: No restrictions. However, considerations should be given to avoid religions sensitivities.

25) What should the weather be like in October or November for outdoor activities?
ANSWER: The temperature is around 25 - 30 C (80 – 85 F) with humidity level of in the range of 70%. 

26) Are we to assume the participants will be dressed to participate in outdoor activities?
ANSWER: The participants will be dressed “casual” as appropriate.

27) How quickly after the in-country meetings with the office directors do you want the tailored office trainings to occur?
ANSWER: Within the same week. Prior e-mail correspondence could be held with the office directors. 

28) How quickly after the tailored office trainings do you want the mission-wide training to occur?
ANSWER:  The least number of days. (As quickly as possible).

29) Would several days breaks between meetings with office directors and tailored office trainings, and between tailored office trainings and mission-wide trainings be acceptable?  Assume no cost to the government for these breaks. 
ANSWER:  Minimal number of days breaks between meetings are preferred.

30) How can one facilitator deliver a high quality training with sustainable outcomes for a group of 50 participants? How can a lecture-type training with very little interaction be effective and generate long-lasting results?
ANSWER: See question #13.

31) How can ‘Personal Strengths’ be utilized when results of a reliable assessment instrument are not available of each and every participant?
ANSWER: See answer #21.

32) What was the previous training? Is it known or has it been documented which effects this previous training had? Have there been any positive long-term outcomes? Have training objectives been reached and fulfilled?
ANSWER: See answer #17 of Questions and Answers, Amendment #1. Additional information could be provided to the successful contractor.

33) Will there be an evaluation at the end of the training and is a monitoring of the outcomes planned?
ANSWER: Monitoring and evaluation of participants is not required. This could be included as a topic.

34) What is meant by interactive? Should there be interaction between participants and/or between instructor and participants?
ANSWER: Activities shall be proposed to encourage interaction between participants and/or between instructor and participants.

35) Is the use of the   Strength Finder assessment   mandated to use in execution of this contract?  
ANSWER: It is not mandatory, but preferred.

36) Will we have some access to Team members as well as team leaders prior to training?
ANSWER: You will have access to team leaders prior to training.

37) Regarding Question #5:    Tailored office training as a 1-dayer for how many participants?  
ANSWER: See question #7 above.

38) In regard to your response to question #8,  how many participants in each team building group? With or without team leaders?  
ANSWER: Each office has a team leader.

39) In response to Question #10 you stated: "In-house sessions separately for all offices up to 3 days and the workshop in an outside venue for all the 50 employees together up to 3 days making total training up to 6 days. The group is mainly locals with approx. 15 expatriate staff.   
Our follow-up question is: Does this mean 2 x 3 days for 2 groups of 25 each?
ANSWER: The same 50 employees will attend both training sessions. See under “Background” in the formal solicitation.  

40) The solicitation requires the workshop agenda for each of the 5 Mission offices to be coordinated with the head of each office prior to start of training. How many days do you require for this coordination?
ANSWER:  The contractor shall propose the number of days required.

41) How many days do you expect the consultant to remain in Country for the post-event coordination with Mission leadership in the solicitation?
ANSWER: Preferably, one day.

42) Since statistically the most productive groups sizes for team building is 15 - 25, will it be possible to break the 50 persons into groups of 25? If so, can these be taught sequentially to meet your desire for only one facilitator, or must this be a group of 50?
ANSWER: The outside workshop will be for the whole group of 50.

43) Could we have further explanation on how the timeline relates to the procedure?  Meaning, will we be developing the curriculum stateside?  If so, will we have the opportunity to ask questions regarding the larger lecture series as well as the smaller department specific consultations prior to arrival on location?
ANSWER:  See question #7 above and under “Background” in the formal solicitation posted on July 22, 2009. E-mail correspondence could be held with the office directors prior to arrival on location.

44) Once on location will we be expected to make material changes to either the larger lecture or smaller office consultation?  If so, to what extent?
ANSWER: You may change the specific activities and the agenda as required after consultations.

a. Meeting Format Requirements: Meeting is held in common with all information   and briefing materials made available to all bidders.

2. Hold one-on-one meetings with each interested bidder and an MDA government representative, with dialog information captured and disclosed to all bidders. All bidders would be offered the opportunity to set up a meeting on SNL Targets Capability.

8am-5pm: One-on-one meetings (one hour increments)

<DESC><p>RECOVERY--RECOVERY--The project consists of improvement of the existing south levee within the Santa Maria levee system. The south levee improvement project includes two (2) reaches extending about 3.25 miles from Suey Crossing Bridge to the Blosser Road. Levee improvement consists of construction of an 8-ft wide and about 30-ft deep compacted soil cement section along the entire levee riverward side slope of both reaches. Construction of the compacted soil cement requires excavation of the existing ground to the depth of approximately 15ft to 20ft below the existing grade. Construction also calls for removal of 3.25 miles long existing bikeway rail and installation of the new one. Removal, disposal and installation of the levee signs, fences and gates are also needed for levee improvement. Resurfacing the existing 14wide ABC levee road with new 3 thick ABC is necessary for operation and maintenance. Three riverward invert access ramps for both reaches will be modified to satisfy the improved levee. There is an existing 3-cell (7x4) Reinforced Concrete Box (RCB) and a 48 Dia. Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP) culverts that need to be extended and included with the new outlet structures. Stone work consists of removal of existing 34 rock groins and 3 soil cement groins and stockpile the removed material at a designated area.<br /><br />The estimated cost of this project is $10,000,000 - $25,000,000.00.<br /><br />NOTE: This project was authorized for construction under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA of 2009.<br /><br />NOTE: This procurement is issued under full and open competition without exclusion of sources. When applicable, FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns will be applied to this action.<br /><br /><br /><br />ALL OFFERORS/BIDDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br /><br />ORDERING SOLICITATION: The solicitation will be available on or about 30 June 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY--Description Changed To:The Philadelphia District, Corps of Engineers, is issuing a negotiated, best value RFP (Request for Proposal) acquisition under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations to acquire a microgrid to replace spot generators with prime power generators, with some utility-like controls, set up as a power plant. This will require the successful offeror to first grid FOB Denver (located 1.0 hour from main NTC post, terrain-rough, with specific location to be determined, and establish the infrastructure. The power plant or microgrid will be configured for power to be delivered based on actual demand, not peak demand for the overall system. Design will allow for the future addition of renewable energy (solar, wind, and/or battery storage). The selected offeror will be required to provide all necessary tools, materials, and equipment and qualified labor to install a 1MW power generation system connected to the grid, inclusive of underground cabling, step down and step up transformers, panel boxes as necessary as well as paralleling gear with load sequencing capabilities (turning on/off generators). The power distribution system or microgrid will provide 480vac, 208vac, and 110/120vac to meet all power requirements. In order to be eligible for award, prices must be submitted on for all major components to each line item. Failure to submit pricing detail for all major components/categories may cause rejection of the offer. Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP. The proposals will be ranked on the basis of the following factors: (a) past performance and experience, (b) technical ability (comprised of contractor submitted proprietary drawings, contractor furnished equipment/product listings/catalogs), (c) management plan, with locations of the offerors primary place of business and field offices, (d) mobilization/ set up schedule, (e) extent of subcontracting, and (f) price. Technical ability is slightly more important than past performance and experience, mobilization/set-up schedules, both of which are of equal weight and more important than the extent of subcontracting. The technical factors when combined are more important that price; however, price remains a significant factor. This is an unrestricted procurement. The applicable NAICS code is 221119, with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours, (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours). The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 11 AUG 2009 with proposals due by 3:00 p.m., local time, 24 August 2009. Hard copy quotes are to be delivered to the Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, Room 643, 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3390 ATTN: Mr. Edward A. Boddie.

<AWARDEE>AMERICAN INDIAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SOCIETY FOUNDATIONPO BOX 9828ALBUQUERQUENM871199828USA
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Human Capital Diversity and Outreach is pursuing a sole source contract with the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) for partial sponsorship of the 31st AISES National Conference under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source. The contract proposed period of performance is October 29 - 31, 2009.
The DOE is one of several agencies providing funding for a conference for American Indians and Alaska Natives majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that hopes to attract and thereby increase the number of American Indian and Alaska Natives in DOE research internships, fellowships, and within STEM careers in the workforce.  Office of Human Capital Diversity and Outreach will receive "Lapis" Career Fair sponsorship.  The co-sponsorship includes: the 2009 Graduate Research Poster Session; active participation in the Government Relations Council, listing of AISES chapters with contract information for the Chapter President and Chapter Advisor; a listing of Native American affiliated K-12 schools.  "Lapis" Career Fair sponsorship provides DOE with one 10 foot by 20 foot draped double exhibit booth, one interview space, six complimentary full registrations and unlimited exhibitor badges, concurrent workshop presentations on writing successful grant ap plications, one year on-line resume database access, "Lapis" recognition on conference website with hotlink to DOE website, "Lapis" recognition in Winds of Change Magazine, complimentary subscription to Winds of Change Magazine, and  "Lapis" designation on badges.  Sponsorship of the Student Research Poster Session grants an opportunity to engage with leading student researchers and provide support for the development of graduate student research presentations (oral and written), covers costs associated with printing of student research abstract booklets, and recognition in the publication.  
The DOE has supported the AISES for a number of years. By using the same forum repeatedly, DOE is able to continue to consistently build on the face-to-face networking previously developed during previous conferences and address the systemic problem of American Indian and Alaska Natives under representation in the Federal government.  As proposed, DOE will have access to students at all stages of the education pipeline, including teachers and faculty advisors.  Opportunities are abundant at the AISES conference for interviewing candidates, providing learning activities, STEM educator training, and disseminating important information about careers and internships at DOE and the national laboratories.  With annual support, the expected outcome is a sustained talent pool available to DOE's national laboratories, the Federal workforce, industries, and universities.
The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this modification is the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. 253 [c] [1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. AISES has the specialized knowledge and services, which have been used by the DOE and other agencies for a number of years successfully. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 813920. ***See Numbered Note 22. Commercial firms who believe they have a superior solution to DOE's proposed award to the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer.
This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested parties should submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government to: Mr. Anthony Buch, MA-642.3, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20585, or via e-mail to Anthony.buch@hq.doe.gov..  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC><p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />BIS WRO Annual Export Control Forum
<p><br />SECTION I: BACKGROUND and Justification for multi-year procurement.</p>
<p>The Export Control Forum is our flagship event on the West Coast, a 1.5 day event, where exporters can meet and discuss export policy and regulatory impacts. It provides an opportunity for west coast exporting companies to interact with U.S. Government officials who implement export control regulations, practices and policies intended to advance U.S. national security and foreign policy, and economic interests. This event is a natural follow-on of our main flagship event: the BIS Annual Update Conference on Export Controls and Policy held in Washington DC each year. We like to keep them about six months apart each year.</p>
<p>Presenters and attendees include high level U.S. Government officials, foreign government and business representatives, export managers, corporate attorneys and consultants. In addition, both government and private sector vendors participate in offering information and services related to export controls and compliance activities.</p>
<p>The annual Update Conference has been held in Washington, DC for the past twenty-one years with well over 1,000 attendees. The West Coast version: Export Control Forum has been held annually the past four years and draws 350 attendees and five-ten vendors with exhibit space.</p>
<p><br />SECTION II: SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor&nbsp;shall provide meeting space, including ballroom facilities, breakout rooms, registration area, storage area, food and beverage, audio-visual and technicians, wireless internet access, vendor exhibit area, separate lunch and reception area, and guest rooms.</p>
<p>The Forum is a 1-1/2 day event to be held Monday-Tuesday February 22-23, 2010. This allows for hotel guests to arrive the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before the event and stay the day after. This weekend prelude would keep the event rate in place during that time: Friday through Wednesday (February 19-24, 2010) on a Run of the House (ROH) basis with no guarantee or deposit required by the government.</p>
<p>The contractor shall honor the prevailing Government GSA Per Diem rate for up to 20 agency speakers each event. The contractor shall provide one complimentary room for every fifty cumulative revenue producing room nights utilized.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (NWP) has aawarded a contract for the installation of a floating island water fowl nesting habitat.  The project entails construction of one 3/4 acre floating island in Sheepy Lake, a permanent body of water located within within Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The island shall be anchored near the center of the southern lobe of Sheepy Lake (Figure 1).  Sheepy Lake has an average surface elevation of approximately 4079 feet and is approximately 430 acres in size.  The proposed island shall float on the lake's surface and be made of recycled material consisting of polypropylene (from recycled carpet) and polyester (from recycled drinking bottles).  Layers of the matrix shall be bonded together with foam. The plastic material shall be stabilized with latex for enhanced UV protection. The island shall be covered by a mixture of small gravel/coarse sand and pumice in order to provide suitable nesting habitat for Caspian terns. <BR><BR>Lower Klamath NWR is managed within the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges Complex, approximately 140 miles inland from the west coast of California. Lower Klamath NWR is in northeastern California (Siskiyou County) and southern Oregon (Klamath County).  The 50,092-acre refuge is a varied mix of intensively managed shallow marshes, open water, grassy uplands, and croplands that provide feeding, resting, nesting, and brood-rearing habitat for waterfowl and other water birds. Lower Klamath NWR receives water via a tunnel from sumps within Tule Lake NWR.  Most of the water that is received is used at the wetland units.  Any leftover water would flow into the Klamath Straits drain, which leads to the Klamath River.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has the responsibility of providing the information technology required to support its business lines.  For decades, a key component in the development of these systems has been based the Unisys ClearPath Enterprise Server platform. A redundant pair of these mainframe computers are located in Eagan, MN and Salt Lake City UT. Six of seven OMB-300 “majors” run on the ClearPath computers, and the majority of all computing FAS undertakes is served by them.

In February 2002 a competitive procurement under GSA Schedule 70 (in accordance with FAR 8.4) was awarded to Unisys under the GSA Blanket Purchase Agreement (entitled, “GSAS) for the purchase and installation of the ClearPath mainframe technology.  Unisys was the one of the competitive solutions considered and recommended by the technical evaluation team.   It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.

The following peripheral equipment items are embedded within the current mainframe operating environment and are not available on GSA Schedule.  The open market maintenance items listed below are embedded within the existing equipment infrastructure and are needed to successfully operate the mainframes:

Hardware maintenance is a necessary requirement to maintain complex technology systems.  The Government requires a turnkey, bundled hosting environment.  The items are a essential components embedded within an overall mainframe environment that is purchased off GSA Schedule.  The Government is not able to isolate these items and purchase them separately, as it would cause undue burden and risk of disruption of required 24x7 operations.  Therefore it is in the Government’s best interest to incorporate the cost of the maintenance services in the total order.


All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.
