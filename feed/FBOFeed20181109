<SUBJECT>CAPSTONE - Outcome Measure Harmonization and Data Infrastructure for Patient Centered Outcomes Research in Depression support.
<SOLNBR>AHRQ-19-10003

<DESC><p>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING SOLICITED AS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be soliciting proposals for Outcome Measure Harmonization and Data Infrastructure for Patient Centered Outcomes Research in Depression support.<br />The AHRQ Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement (CEPI) conducts and supports research and evidence synthesis on health care delivery and improvement; advances decision and communication sciences to facilitate informed treatment and health care decision making by patients and their health care providers; explores how health information technology can improve clinical decision making and health care quality; catalyzes and promotes sustainability of improvements in clinical practice across health care settings through research, demonstration projects, and partnership development; and operates the National Center for Excellence in Primary Care Research <br />AHRQ has developed a core set of harmonized definitions of patient centered outcome measures in five different clinical areas (atrial fibrillation, asthma, depression, lung cancer and lumbar spondylolisthesis) in an existing Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) funded project (see https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/topics/registry-of-patient-registries/outcome-measures-framework) . Despite the recognized value of these harmonized core outcome measures, stakeholders are reluctant to put resources into implementing them because of three main perceived barriers:<br />1. Burden on patients and clinicians to collect patient reported outcomes from patients; <br />2. Disruptions to clinical care when collecting structured data from clinicians or challenges in extracting high quality information from unstructured data already in patient records; and<br />3. Difficulty working with electronic health records. <br />This project will address the barriers cited by registries and demonstrate feasibility and value by incorporating data collection in a way that fits into the workflow of busy practices and facilitates communication between specialists and primary care. This data collection can then be used as infrastructure for patient centered outcomes research.<br />The overall objectives of this contract are to facilitate and advance the use of registries and registry research. <br />Specifically, the objectives of this contract are: <br />(1) Collect electronic health data from existing structured and unstructured information in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and directly form patients at multiple clinical sites at fixed intervals for patient outcomes associated with treatment for depression<br />(2) Transfer the collected data to electronic patient registries <br />(3) Develop governance and data use agreement templates with the registries so that data may be made available to external researchers. <br />(4) Develop infrastructure and tools to allow replication for other clinical registries and clinical systems. This project will examine whether this approach to data collection and transfer enhances the ability to use registries for research on patient outcomes. <br />The anticipated outcomes of this project are:<br />Phase I:<br />1. Risk analysis of number and ability of EHRs to send/exchange data to the registries</p>
<p>Phase II:<br />1. Tools for clinicians and patients to facilitate integration of the harmonized depression outcome measures into electronic health records (EHRs) and registries so that these data will be available for clinical research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement and implementation research.</p>
<p>2. Proof of concept for a standards-based approach (an approach that uses technical standards for data extraction/collection/exchange) for collecting and reporting patient outcomes information to clinicians within their workflow and simultaneously transmitting the data to registries to make it available for research.</p>
<p>3. Tools to make it easier for researchers and registry developers to integrate registries with clinical systems.</p>
<p>4. Governance and data use agreement templates that can be used by registries to make data available to external researchers.</p>
<p>AHRQ anticipates awarding a single contract in May 2019 with a four (4) month base period: Phase I - Risk Assessment and one (1), twenty (20) month option period: Phase II - Data Exchange and other activities. <br />The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of synopsis.</p>
<p>Additionally, please see the attached draft SOW. This version of the SOW is in its near final form. The Agency does not anticipate significant changes to occur between this posting and the final SOW included in the full RFP.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACTUAL ACTION FOR NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR Development and Testing of a Multi-Phenomenology<br />Sensor Package for the MS-177. This is an announcement that the United States Air Force<br />(USAF), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to issue/award an Indefinite Delivery,<br />Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS), Westford,<br />MA for the purpose of long-range ISR technology maturation and demonstration under the<br />authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A). This is a maturation and demonstration of component<br />technologies in which the Government has invested over the last decade. Developed across<br />numerous contracts, these state-of-the-art technologies include a UTAS-designed shortwave<br />infrared (SWIR) sensor system, a novel UTAS-designed telescope, a Government-designed multimode ladar system, a novel hyperspectral imager, and the Government-owned AgilePod&reg; family<br />of pods. The estimated value of this contract is $92M with an overall period of performance<br />anticipated to begin in FY19, ending in FY23.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall be responsible for integrating the above sensors and telescope into an MS-177<br />and flight testing them either inside an AgilePod&reg; mounted on a U-2 or on an RQ-4. The sensors<br />must be installed concurrently without violating the size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of<br />the MS-177 and without degrading the performance of the UTAS-designed telescope. Sensor<br />output must conform to existing MS-177 data processing, exploitation, and dissemination<br />pipelines. This effort involves complex phenomenology and detailed engineering that requires<br />specialized expertise and knowledge. This effort requires contractor use and proficiency with the<br />MS-177 sensor system as well as the U-2 and/or RQ-4.</p>
<p><br />UTAS is a for-profit company which conducts research in the field of sensor technology with a<br />focus on high-altitude, long-range sensors and data exploitation. UTAS is the sole developer and<br />manufacturer of the MS-177 sensor system.</p>
<p><br />Vendors who are capable of providing the effort above shall fully identify their interest and submit,<br />in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements<br />stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to<br />Joseph Strehle, Contracting Officer, via email at Joseph.Strehle@us.af.mil. Responses received<br />after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis<br />and will not be considered. Other business opportunities for AFRL are available at<br />www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposed contract action is for products which the government intends<br />to solicit and negotiate with UTAS under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A). Interested<br />persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit<br />proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received to this<br />notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be<br />considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact (POC) identified in this announcement.</p>
<p><br />5. General Operations Security (OPSEC) procedures, policies and awareness are required in an<br />effort to reduce program vulnerability from successful adversary collection and exploitation of<br />critical information. The Critical Information List (CIL) will be provided upon request by<br />AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office. While working on the government installation,<br />OPSEC guidance will be provided by the AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office.</p>

<DESC>The proposed sole source action is for a firm-fixed price (FFP)for the renewal of
software subscriptions for ProjNet DrChecks software in use by the Office of
Construction & Facilities Management (CFM).  The proposed contract is to renew software maintenance for DrChecks software currently in use by CFM for a total five one-year subscriptions, each consisting of three small licenses and one large license, to allow CFM to manage its design reviews of construction projects. The ProjNet DrChecks software is used to provide business-process based information exchange applications between the public sector contact or project management offices, funding agencies, and all tiers of designers, consultants, builders, subcontractors, suppliers and manufacturers. It allows the users to securely coordinate information exchanged, and all data is processed with a security accredited platform. ProjNet DrChecks expedites the
process and the resolution of each improvement suggestion under its Design
Review and Checking System. The software is used to empower project teams to
improve design quality through an integrated web-based business process.
DrChecks software subscriptions provide access to the software, access to webinar
software training, and call center support for account registration, login, password,
and other general questions. The three small licenses will be for CFM locations in
Silver Springs, Maryland, North Chicago, Illinois, and Mare Island, California. The
one large license is for the Headquarters, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in
Washington, DC. The period of performance is a one year base plus four one-year
options.   The estimated date of award for this action is December 13, 2018.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541519 with a corresponding small business size standard $27.5M average annual revenue.

ProjNet DrChecks was developed by U.S. Army Engineer Research and
Development Center (ERDC), Construction Engineering Research Laboratory
(CERL), Champaign, Illinois. ERDC-CERL created and maintained the
development tools in 1998 and licensed to NIBS in 2007. The Institute,
authorized by Public Law 93-383 in 197 4, is a nonprofit, non-governmental
organization that is able to offer wider visibility than was possible for ERDC
researchers. The Institute serves as an authoritative source of advice for both the
private and public sectors to use in the building science and technology. A
search of the internet conducted on June 14, 2018 indicated that NIBS was the
only source for ProjNet DrChecks software. In addition, email contact was made
with ERDC-CERL confirmed that NIBS is the only authorized source for this
software.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Robert Geran, Contract Specialist, Robert.Geran@va.gov and Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1;">Collaboration on UAM Airspace Integration Resesearch and Development</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has conducted research on a multitude of Air Traffic Management (ATM) areas over the past several decades. The concepts, technologies, and procedures developed through these efforts have meaningfully benefited the flying public and the aviation community in the form of more efficient and predictable operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Many of these tools and methods were developed for traditional fixed-wing aircraft and passenger-transportation operations. They include technologies for flight planning, scheduling, sequencing, and spacing to a constrained resource such as an airport, dynamic re-routing around weather, traffic flow management, and disruption management.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recently, NASA has increased its focus on developing technologies and standards for new types of aircraft and missions being pursued by the broader aviation community, such as small unmanned aircraft systems conducting package delivery. NASA&rsquo;s ATM-X project is working towards integrating new, diverse entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS), while also leveraging NASA&rsquo;s prior achievements in ATM that continue to improve traditional airspace operations. This includes ATM-X&rsquo;s Initial Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Operations Integration sub-project, which is conducting research on the airspace integration concepts, technologies, and procedures needed to conduct UAM operations safely and efficiently alongside other airspace users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">UAM&mdash;defined as safe and efficient air traffic operations into, out of, and within a metropolitan area by manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems&mdash;is being researched and developed by industry, academia, and government. The NASA ATM-X UAM sub-project is focused on the airspace integration aspect of UAM both to enable early entrants in the airspace and also to identify, develop, and evaluate the services, procedures, and tools necessary to support high-tempo, high-demand mature UAM operations. Research activities could involve fast-time simulations and/or real-time simulations, the latter of which could include Human in the Loop (HITL) simulations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal of Collaboration Sought</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The development of an ecosystem for UAM requires input from and collaboration between a wide range of groups. This includes manufacturers of electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, manufacturers of avionics and other equipment, builders of takeoff and landing areas, and researchers of the airspace integration concepts, technologies, and procedures needed to conduct UAM operations safely and efficiently alongside other airspace users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NASA has embraced an agile &ldquo;Build, Explore, and Learn&rdquo; collaborative approach for UAM airspace integration and will engage with partners and stakeholders to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">determine how to work together on </span>research and development activities related to UAM airspace integration. The primary objective sought through this RFI is to evaluate and document the tradeoffs across the wide range of possibilities for UAM airspace integration through coordinated and collaborative research activities in a way that the UAM community at large can use to determine operational performance requirements for UAM vehicles and systems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To address these airspace integration challenges, the UAM sub-project will undertake the following activities:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information and Partnerships Sought</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NASA is seeking information and collaboration interest regarding the above plans. Interested parties from the UAM community, traditional aviation community, and other areas of the aviation community and related sectors are encouraged to respond. The benefit to the community includes the ability to test and evaluate UAM concepts, algorithms, and procedures in realistic and relevant simulation environments towards integration in the NAS.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support is seeking sources capable of providing Medtronic Spine "procedural packages" and Biologics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These "procedural packages" include Orthopedic Implants, Instrumentation Sets and Auxiliary products (such as drill bits, saw blades, bone cement, etc.) that are necessary for the orthopedic surgery. The instruments are purchased by the hospital so they are readily available on the shelves.<br /><br />All products offered must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.<br /><br />Orthopedic products must be delivered "Just-In-Time," "Direct Vendor Delivery", and "Consignment". Under "Just-In-Time" delivery, the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) calls the manufacturer's field representative who carries the products into the MTF just-in-time for the surgery. The manufacturer's sales representative may bring many sizes and types of implants and auxiliary products to the surgery along with the instrumentation sets. Under the "Direct Vendor Delivery" method an order for products is placed through ECAT and the product is delivered directly to the customer via any transportation carrier. Under the "Consignment" method, an MTF has the products that make up the "procedural set" consigned to their facility.<br /><br />At the request of the MTF, the manufacturer is required to have a qualified representative on site at the MTF's within the timeframe specified by the facility necessary to meet their requirements. The manufacturer's representative provides technical advice and guidance to the physician before, during, and after implantation. Furthermore, technical support is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. The Medtronic Sales Representatives are experts on the vendor's products and are a vital part of helping to ensure that the patient is getting the necessary treatment. Sources must have direct control over a sales force that is knowledgeable in Medtronic products. At the request of the MTF, the request for each of the documents<br /><br />This is a request for information (RFI) and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.<br /><br />Your response to this Request for Information may be submitted electronically in PDF format and emailed to <span><a>charles.reimer@dla.mil</a></span>.

A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.</span></p>

A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 333999 All Other Miscellaneous General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing with size standard 500 employees.<br /> <br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>To establish and move stem cell technologies forward through a more centralized effort, NIH has launched the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) within NCATS. Part of the NIH Common Fund, the goal of the SCTL is to bring iPSC technology closer to clinical application, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Through the SCTL, NCATS will provide researchers across various disciplines and organizations with the ability to establish collaborations to advance the translation of regenerative medicine applications.</p>
<p>The SCTL has a potential requirement for an automated, centrifugation-based plate washer with dispenser system to enable SCTL researchers to gently wash microplates using centrifugation, which will greatly reduce potential contamination, cell lose intra-well and increase throughput of assays that require multiple wash steps. Centrifugation allows for a contact-free and complete removal of liquid from the well without disrupting adherent cells.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources capable of achieving the essential features of this potential requirement. The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain one (1) Automated centrifugation-based plate washer with dispenser system in accordance with the essential features described herin.</p>
<p>SCTL high-throughput screening projects require the washing of 384- and 1536-well microplates. Currently, SCTL currently only has aspirator-type washers to perform this function. Using an aspirator-type washer is a tedious procedure, and each wash step can introduce a degree of volumetric error and a potential source of contamination into the assay plate/s. Also, some cells do not tolerate the agitation of multiple dispense/aspiration steps, so cells can be lost from wells in cell-based assays.</p>
<p>Project Requirements <br />Specifically, the following features are deemed essential that this potential requirement shall achieve:</p>
<p>Uses centrifugation instead of aspiration for non-contact and contamination-free removal of liquids from all plate formats, including 1536 well.</p>
<p>Achieves near zero residual volume and eliminates problems associated with conventional, aspiration-based washers.</p>
<p>Reduces assay background and variability, eliminates wash steps and needle clogging, while increasing throughput, reliability and saving consumable cost with tipless media-changes in cell-based screening and magnetic bead wash applications.</p>
<p>Has Automated, centrifugation-based plate dryer and media changer.</p>
<p>Provides Software licenses for graphical user interface (GUI) and firmware (FW) with updates for 12 months.</p>
<p>Has gravity based liquid waste handling capability.</p>
<p>Has dispenser option for 96, 384, and 1536 well plates from up to 7 liquid input channels.</p>
<p>Contractors submitting a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall possess the ability to achieve the salient government essential features of this potential requirement. Specifically, Offerors to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall document evidence of being able to provide the subject supply that will allow for the essential features described herein to be accomplished.</p>
<p>Delivery/Warranty<br />Offerors should indicate an estimated delivery time in full after receipt of an order and any other training or warranty or software license considerations applicable. Inspection and acceptance will be performed at NCATS located at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SOUGHT <br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Respondents must provide, as part of their response: (a) product, catalog, model, and/or part number(s); (b) product description; (c) all relevant information and documentation that the item(s) offered meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in this announcement; (d) quantity; (e) shipping, handling, and/or installation instructions, and/or any special delivery conditions after receipt of an order.</p>

The response must be submitted to Hunter Tjugum electronically, at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov, and be received prior to the closing date specified in this announcement.</p>
<p>CONCLUDING STATEMENTS<br />Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>It is the Governments intent to purchase approximately 250 sit-stand units to be delivered to NAVSUP Business Systems Center, Building 409, in Mechanicsburg, PA.  Preliminary market research has shown that the FlexiSpot M4B 41 corner riser standing desk converter with removable keyboard tray is the only sit-stand unit that meets the minimum requirements of the Government.  The Government is seeking additional market information about any alternative sit stand units that meet the minimum requirements stated below.  

	Removable keyboard tray
	41 corner riser (corner configuration)
	Requires no additional assembly/installation (comes pre-assembled)
	Requires no modification to the existing workstation surface
	Can accommodate two monitors
	Adjustable without expanding outward
	Lowest height setting placement of keyboard and monitor allows for ergonomic use in seated position.
	Single hand adjustment

Vendors with alternatives other than the FlexiSpot M4B 41 corner riser standing desk converter with removable keyboard tray shall provide a Manufacturer and Part number for the alternative unit along with any specifications sheets appropriate or a link to a website listing the alternate product specifications.
 The information provided may be used to determine acquisition method and whether to set this requirement aside for small businesses so please provide your business status with any response.

All Vendors interested are encouraged to provide information on any strategic sourcing contract vehicles (GSA Schedule 71, Navy Furniture BPAs, FPI, etc.) the Government can leverage to purchase the suggested sit-stand unit.  

Vendors may provide pricing for market research purposes at their discretion.

There is no solicitation at this time. This request for market information does not constitute a request for quotes; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.

One such program function under PEMP provides technical and financial support for generators and related accessories which are provided to residences occupied by full-time Foreign Service Officers stationed at Embassy locations as well as other agency residences assigned to Embassy locations around the world. This process is governed by organizational policies which designates PEMP as the responsible Department of State (DOS) organization for approving the sizing all generators while also providing Post with the necessary assistance and guidance for the procurement and installation of the generators.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">OBO/CFSM/FAC/PS has centralized the procurement of residential generators through a process which pre-qualifies several vendors which have the ability to demonstrate adequate conformance to a standard product specification while also having the ability to support delivery and maintenance on a global scale. This has been accomplished through the establishment of an IDIQ contract which allows several pre-qualified vendors to provide proposals for the manufacture, shipping and warranty support of generators, automatic transfer switches and related accessories ranging in size from 20 KVA to approximately 1000 KVA. Generators will need to meet the voltage and frequency spectrum for worldwide use and as defined in the equipment specification in Attachment-A (Packaged Generator Specifications). Transfer switches will generally be 4-pole ranging in size from 100 Amp to 1600 Amp and as further defined in the equipment specifications in Attachment-B (Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) Specifications). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>In addition PEMP has a requirement where vendors need to support government owned information systems by providing a web service that permits the tracking of specific equipment data and expected delivery dates. OBO/CFSM/FAC/PS anticipates a new solicitation for this requirement within the next six months and is seeking information from organizations having interests and capabilities in the manufacture and delivery of this equipment. </span></p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />NRL RFI Announcement # N00173-19-RFI-ET01<br />Title: High-Rate Receiver/ Modems
<p>I. DISCLAIMER:  <br /> <br />This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice.  Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  It is the responsibility of any potential contractor to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this topic.</p>
<p>Information on the specific topic of interest is provided in the following sections of this announcement.  Neither the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) nor any other part of the Federal Government will be responsible for any cost incurred by responders in furnishing this information.  <br /> <br />II. BACKGROUND:  <br /> <br />The NRL, Satellite and Communication Section (Code 8144), is seeking to procure equipment necessary to demodulate and format data into the proprietary data format of the mission processing equipment downstream.  The components required are the three line items listed below to include the non&shy;recurring engineering, which is required for this effort.  The three component pieces of equipment listed below are not commercially available from other vendors due to the unique formatting required for the mission processing equipment.  The non-recurring engineering includes small modification to the software required in order for the equipment to be useful for long-term operations as well as porting of software code and associated testing/verification of the high rate receiver modem.</p>
<p>III. SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:</p>
<p>The critical requirements of the high rate receiver modem are as follows:</p>
<p>Item No. 	Description								Qty<br />1		P/N  TBD VHR-3200 Satellite Modem 				2<br />2		P/N  TBD VDP-SDH Satellite Data Processor 			1<br />3		Non-Recurring Engineering (Porting of SW Code and Testing)	1</p>
<p>The items listed above are further explained as the following by line item number.</p>
<p>1	VHR-3200 is a satellite modem to receive mission data from satellites of interest.<br />2	VDP-SDH is a satellite data processor that process information into usable data structure<br />for the 	mission processer. <br />3	Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) to funds the porting of software code and testing and<br />verification to the VHR-3200 for a specific mission.</p>
<p>The items above are required for an operational mission with a need date of May 2019.  The units have a 7 month lead-time after receipt of order and the manufacturer can deliver the equipment earlier if possible to meet the Government's need date.  The non-recurring engineering will occur at the Contractor's facility prior to shipping and will be tested as part of this effort.  The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought - Request for Information (RFI) / Industry Day Notice</p>
<p>Ultra-Light Tactical Vehicle (ULTV) Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is for planning purposes, and does not constitute an invitation for bids, a Request for Proposal (RFP), a solicitation, a request for quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this notice. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses. Direct any and all inquiries to the point of contact via e-mail.</p>
<p>2. Background and Description. The Program Executive Officer Land Systems (PEO LS), Program Manager, Light Tactical Vehicles (PM LTV) is looking for interested parties to address the Marine Corps need for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), modular, off-road utility vehicle that can be quickly configured to support casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), command and control, and electronic warfare missions, and provide logistics support for infantry units, can carry crew served weapons, and is internally transportable within MV-22 and CH-53E/K aircraft. This RFI seeks to gather information on commercially available, internally transportable vehicles that will meet a technology readiness level (TRL) of 8 by Fiscal Year 21 (FY21) in order to support a potential full rate production decision.</p>
<p>3. Objectives. <br />a. RFI. This RFI constitutes market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and is not an RFP. The Marine Corps is seeking information on candidate systems that are currently available to support a potential acquisition under the non-developmental ULTV program and to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated acquisition schedule at an affordable cost. The Marine Corps wants to determine the technical and manufacturing maturity of candidate systems that provide capabilities desired for the ULTV as described in paragraph 4.</p>
<p>b. Industry Day. PM LTV, PEO LS, will host a two-day industry day to present information regarding the potential ULTV acquisition. This event is intended to provide information relating to the Government's goals for the acquisition as well as solicit feedback from industry regarding the acquisition. Industry day details are provided in paragraph 5.</p>
<p>4. RFI:<br />a. Proprietary Information. Submission of proprietary data in response to this RFI is discouraged, however, it will be accepted. PM LTV acknowledges its obligation under the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to protect confidential information provided to the Government. Pursuant to this statute, PM LTV is willing to protect trade secrets and observe valid proprietary restrictions placed upon data presented in response to this survey and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; All data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified as to what data is considered proprietary.<br />&bull; Mark only portions of data that is truly proprietary.<br />&bull; Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in possession of PM LTV, other U.S. Government activities, or third parties on an unprotected basis. Do not submit any classified data in response to this market survey.<br />&bull; All proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal email as well as at the beginning of the file. Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br />&bull; Access to any proprietary data will be restricted to government personnel assigned to PM LTV and PEO Land Systems.<br />&bull; The Government does not assume any duty to contact a respondent and inquire whether any unmarked information submitted in response to this RFI is proprietary.</p>
<p>b. Disclaimer. This RFI is unrestricted. It is an inquiry intended to measure the capability of commercial products, development needs, and level of industry interest. Responses to this RFI may affect the Government's decision to issue any contracts or other transaction agreements for full and open competition. This is not a pre-solicitation notice or request for proposal (RFP), nor will any contracts or agreements be awarded from this announcement. Information provided regarding the potential contracts or agreements, as presented in this RFI, is subject to change. Additionally, this inquiry does not bind the Government to solicit for, or award any contracts or agreements. Participation in this RFI from a potential offeror is strictly voluntary; no reimbursements will be made to any vendor for costs associated with participation. Data submitted to the Government will not be returned, but will remain archived as part of historic records.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Excimer Laser System Rental Agreement
Background
As per the Chief of cardio-thoracic surgery, Dr. Grossi, the Excimer Laser System is used to extract infected pacer leads as an alternative to sternotomy and exploratory cardiotomy. Philips Spectranetics manufactures and markets the only Excimer Laser System approved in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan for use in minimally invasive interventional procedures within the cardiovascular system. The Philips Spectranetics CVX-300 excimer laser in conjunction with proprietary optical fiber catheters is the only excimer laser system approved for use in the removal of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator leads. An excimer laser produces pulsed bursts of ultraviolet (UV) light energy that are capable of vaporizing plaque and calcium into tiny particles, the majority of which are smaller than a red blood cell, that are easily absorbed into the bloodstream. This energy is transmitted along flexible glass fibers encased in catheters, which can be passed through arteries and veins. The UV light energy is then focused on the blockages that need to be treated.

The Excimer CV laser is currently on site in the (NYHHS) Manhattan Campus Operating Room (OR),NY ,and has been used on an ongoing basis by the cardiac surgeons since January 2008.  The Excimer laser is a critical piece of equipment that must remain on-site for the safety of cardiac surgery patients.  The OR Manager and the Chief of Cardiothoracic surgery have confirmed the continued need for this equipment for patient care.  Both have also advised that it is more economical to lease this laser than to purchase it and it is absolutely necessary for patient care. The Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System (NYHHS) Manhattan Campus is the VISN 3 referral center for Cardiothoracic Surgery.

This is a request for a base year plus 4 option years flat rental agreement or contract. The Philips Spectranetics CVX-300 excimer laser as this is the only Excimer laser system approved for use in the removal of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator leads.

<SUBJECT>V--Barging services on Lake Chelan WA, intent to make sole source award
<SOLNBR>140P8319Q0004
<CONTACT>Welch, Sarah

<a href="mailto:Sarah_Welch@nps.gov">CO e-mail: sarah_welch@nps.gov</a>
<DESC>This special notice informs the public that North Cascades NPS Complex intends to award a non-competitive requirements contract for barge transportation services using a firm-fixed price schedule and paying for actual services received. The Contractor's barge will transport materials, supplies, bulk fuel, vehicles, and equipment for NPS operations and special projects between Stehekin and Chelan, WA, and points in between. A signed Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file; the contents are provided herein.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS ($10,000 to $250,000) (See FAR 13.106-1) 
Prepared in accordance with AP&P 1443.06-01 Enhancing Competition and Contracting by Other than Full and Open Competition, Rev. 1.  Thresholds updated per DOI-AAAP-0148.

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):
Transportation services by barge to and from Stehekin and Chelan, Washington, and points in between, of materials, supplies, bulk fuel, vehicles, and equipment to support National Park Service (NPS) operations and special projects.  Stehekin is a remote community located at the head of Lake Chelan.  No roads connect Stehekin to outside sources of supplies and materials and all such items must be transported approximately 50 miles via boat or barge.  Transportation prices will be comparable to those charged to the public and are based on square-footage of deck space used, ease of handling, etc.; payment will be made based on actual services received.  

NPS intends to award a non-competitive requirements contract using a firm-fixed price schedule for a base year, with the unilateral right to extend it for up to two option years.  The estimated cost for each year is between $20,000 and $35,000, although may be significantly higher if there is wildfire suppression activity with an associated increased demand for transportation services.  The total for all three years is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($250,000).  The contract year is December 1 through November 30.

Annual costs during the recent past are:
FY18    $15,981 - actual through Sept 30 (estimate for Oct and Nov is $5,000)
FY17    $20,065             
FY16	$32,312		
FY15	$33,577		
FY14	$86,854	 - increased use due to wildfires and rock hauling
FY13	$40,700		
FY12	$28,750
FY11	$67,173	 - increased use due to hauling rock for road repairs and re-routes
FY10	$98,306	 - increased use due to wildfires
FY09	$44,653
FY08	$34,178

2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
__X__	Only one responsible source. 
______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. 
______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 

Only one vendor, Mountain Barge Services LLC, operates a barge capable of providing the required freight transportation services on Lake Chelan.  

 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:  

Web searches using Google, SBAs Dynamic Small Business Search, System for Award Management (SAM), and SuperPages found only the one barge company noted above.  A Special Notice for this action will be posted at FBO, and any information received in response will be taken under consideration by NPS.  Local knowledge of the vendor pool indicates this is the only viable service. 

4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.
b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<p>Solicitation Number:</p>

<p>Set-Aside Code:</p>
<p>100% Small Business Set Aside</p>
<p>Response Date:</p>
<p>10 Dec 2018</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>U.S. Army Engineer District, Galveston<br />2000 Fort Point Road<br />Galveston, Texas 77553</p>
<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily land survey and mapping services in support of the civil works, military and International and Interagency Services (IIS) mission areas. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District (SWG) but up to the Southwestern Division (SWD) area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $10,000,000 and includes a target of two Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than two firms depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $10,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Contractor Manpower Reporting: For any task orders associated with military funding types, the contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the Department of Defense via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/. Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 01 through September 30. While inputs may be reported at any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year, beginning with 2019. Contractors may direct questions to the help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount will be $3,000,000 unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: A-E services include, but are not necessarily limited to, topographical, boundary, planimetric, subsurface utility location, and LiDAR surveys of various locations within SWG up to the SWD boundaries. All projects within the states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and New Mexico shall be performed under the direct supervision and review of an active registered professional land surveyor (RPLS) for that state. These services may also include hydrographic, both coastal and riverine, surveying in support of the development of a complete deliverable. The services performed under this contract and the individual task orders will include drawing preparation using computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software in the preparation of deliverables. All drawings produced for this contract shall be in compliance with the Architect/Engineering/Construction CADD standards as issued by the CADD/BIM Technology Center https://cadbimcenter.erdc.dren.mil/. The Government will only accept the final products, without conversion or reformatting, in the MicroStation suite of software's and/or AutoCAD based on the requirements stated in the Statement of Work. Drawings produced by scanning drawings of record or containing photographic images shall be delivered in a raster format compatible with MicroStation electronic digital format. Geographic Information System (GIS) information shall adhere to the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards. Design Analysis and any other reports shall be prepared using MS-Word (.doc).

<p>Partial Small Business Set Aside</p>
<p>Response Date:</p>
<p>10 December 2018</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>U.S. Army Engineer District, Galveston<br />2000 Fort Point Road<br />Galveston, Texas 77553</p>
<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily hydrographic survey and mapping services in support of the civil works mission area. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District but up to the Southwestern Division area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $7,000,000 and includes a target of one (1) Unrestricted A-E IDC and a target of one (1) reserve Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than one (1) firm within each business class depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting.<br />Firms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the solicitation number in PART I, A Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate proposal MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $7,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit these plans during contract negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount for the Unrestricted would be $3,000,000 and for the Small Business reserve would be $150,000, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. All requirements with an estimated value at or below the maximum amount will be reserved for the Small Business class first. Should review of the qualifications of the Small Business firm find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, the government will then proceed to the Unrestricted class. The government will not consider a requirement above the $150,000 threshold to be automatically directed to the Unrestricted class, as the Small Business reserve will be considered first for each requirement irrespective of its estimated value. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>9. Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. (a) The Government may award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p><br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror in LPTA solicitations.<br />To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a service, the quoted service shall meet the solicitation requirements including terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. The quote shall state that all aspects of the technical requirement, including required delivery date and part numbers, can be met.</p>
<p>If utilized, a past performance evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(C). The Government intends to utilize the Government Wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for past performance evaluations as a basis for anticipating successful/unsuccessful performance on this required effort. To be considered acceptable for past performance, a search of the PPIRS must reveal no negative past performance information for the recent and relevant records. In the event there are no recent and/or relevant PPIRS records, the quoter may submit information on recent and relevant subcontracts and/or commercial contracts. If no recent and relevant contracts are available in PPIRS or submitted by the offeror, the quoter's past performance record shall be considered "unknown." In the context of acceptable or unacceptable, "unknown" past performance shall be considered "acceptable." To be considered recent, the effort must either still be in progress or have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice. To be considered relevant the record should be similar in terms of complexity, scope, and magnitude. "Scope" is defined as experience in areas defined in the SOW. "Magnitude" is defined as the measure of similarity of the volume, dollar value, and/or duration of work actually performed under the quoter's submitted contracts to the SOW. At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS. If furnished, this submission will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures described above.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror by the Government within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />10. All Offerors must include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. <br />52.212-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Nov 2017)<br /><br />11. Clause 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Offers/quotes submitted in response to this solicitation shall not contain nor be subject to the offeror's/vendor's standard commercial terms and conditions.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW) & RECYCLING SERVICES


BACKGROUND

VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) is an integrated healthcare system comprised of two Medical Centers: the Alvin C. York Campus in Murfreesboro, TN, the Nashville Campus in Nashville, TN, andmany community based outpatient clinics and other facilities located in Tennessee and Kentucky.
TVHS provides ambulatory care, primary care, and secondary care in acute medicine and surgery, specialized tertiary care, transplant services, spinal cord injury, outpatient care, and a full range of extended care and mental health services.The Nashville Campus is the only VA facility that supports all solid organ transplant programs, including total in-house kidney and bone marrow transplants. The Alvin C. York Campus is a network referral center for mental health services, geriatrics, and extended care. TVHS provides a full range of specialized medical services.
TVHS has a mandated goal to achieve a 50% or greater recycling rate across the healthcare system.  Currently, at the conclusion of FY17, TVHS has a diversion rate of approximately 33.9%.  As such, TVHS is looking for service providers who can help assist in obtaining this goal of 50%.  Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in a site visit of the two main campuses to observe current waste management and recycling practices.  It is the VA s intent to allow each offeror to develop and submit a Recycling Plan that will help the VA manage waste in the most efficient, economical and best way possible to obtain a 50% or greater recycling/diversion rate by the end of the 2nd Option Period of the contract.   A general overview of how the offeror intends to help the VA accomplish their 50% goal is expected with the offer.  The awardee will conduct an independent study of the VAs current recycling practices and accounting and will provide the plan to the COR for approval.  

SOLID WASTE & RECYCYCLABLES REMOVAL

The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and expertise necessary to perform waste removal and recycling services consisting of municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling of numerous materials including but not limited to cardboard, metal, plastic, wood, yard waste, food waste, solid fill, and construction debris typical of healthcare, institutional, and office occupancy excluding regulated medical waste, pathological, anti-neoplastic (chemotherapeutic) waste,  and hazardous wastes for TVHS..   Offerors should be aware that there is always a potential for inappropriate hazardous waste in any solid waste stream.  Training and programs implemented by the awardee and the VA should prevent or reduce any such potential. 
The Contractor shall provide all equipment to include roll-offs, tip dumpsters, compactor units, guide rails, collection units, etc. to accomplish proper MSW and recycling removal.  Due to space constraints and the number of potential recycling streams, it is highly encouraged that proposals include single stream recycling initiatives.
The Contractor shall provide all labor for segregating recyclable materials from MSW that ends up in the roll-offs, dumpsters, etc. to ensure all potentially recyclable materials are segregated, recycled, and diverted from landfills.  This applies to readily available items identified in the dumpsters.  For example, the Contractor identifies large pieces of metal or a wooden desk in a dumpster.  It is expected the Contractor will extricate the recyclable materials and place them in the appropriate recycling stream.  The Contractor is not expected to open bags of trash to find recyclable materials.

Any equipment provided by the Contractor shall be compatible with existing TVHS equipment and electrical connections. TVHS shall provide AC current to the equipment.

Some containers may be designated to receive  On Call  services. This refers to waste containers that are used intermittently and not filled on a regular basis. For example, a recycling container used for yard waste will be serviced differently throughout the year. During summer and fall months there may be increased usage of this container. At any time during the year, there may be damage that is caused by weather that may require increased usage of this container (e.g. after storm cleanup). Containers designated as  On Call  indicates the COR or other authorized representatives of TVHS will contact the vendor to request emptying of this container. On Call is defined as the VA will call when services is needed.

The Contractor will work with TVHS personnel to develop a comprehensive recycling plan for the identified sites.  The Recycling Plan shall include at a minimum the following:  

Identification of specific waste streams and collection methods.
Locations of specific waste stream containers and management/pickup frequencies.
Solid waste stream assessment (identification of waste stream components and percentages).
Opportunities for new recyclable waste streams and best management practices for collection/removal.
Employee training.
Signage for specific waste stream collection.

The Contractor shall travel to the Alvin C. York campus and Nashville campus as often as necessary to implement a successful waste reduction and recycling program and to the outpatient clinics at least twice annually to inspect and review their recycling programs and progress.  

The Contractor shall make presentations and conduct demonstrations of products, services, and techniques to TVHS staff to ensure successful implementation of a waste reduction and recycling program. 

The Contractor, COR, and CO shall meet quarterly to review the current progress of the Contract and to discuss ways to improve compliance, review past performance, issues and concerns, and review and update (modification as needed) of the comprehensive recycling plan, to name a few.

HISTORICAL DATA 
The following information is an analysis of current waste streams for FY17 for TVHS.  This information should give prospective offerors an expectation of volume and what waste streams will need to be captured:


























WASTE AUDIT

The Contractor shall provide TVHS an annual waste stream survey of all sites to include a formal written report after completion, in which the Contractor specifically reviews the waste generation and waste flow within each facility to determine areas of opportunity for waste reduction and elimination.  The audit will be based on what TVHS currently places in its waste streams.  This establishes the plan moving forward of what the offeror and the VA need to work on.  The first audit will be provided to the COR 90 days after award of the contract.

Once a clear reduction plan is approved, the Contractor and TVHS will implement the program.  The Contractor and COR will develop and administer training to employees and work with them to achieve the program's goals. 

The Contractor shall provide a monthly tracking reporting system that shall allow for TVHS to track all wastes from the point of generation as a means to identify waste volume and classification. This report shall clearly demonstrate the facilities classification of wastes and opportunities for reduction. The report shall track all waste streams to include solid waste, recycling, and diverted wastes. The report shall also provide recycling data (e.g. pounds and type). The Contractor shall provide a sample of the proposed report to the COR for approval. This sample shall be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Notice of Award.  See Appendix A for a suggested format.

TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor and TVHS will train employees on the different types of waste in their area (solid waste, recyclables, etc.) and where to properly dispose of it. The contractor shall monitor and track cost, waste generation by type and location, and training records for employees. The frequencies and locations of training varies and is dependent on the deficiencies identified and programs and processes implemented.  All training records shall be sent electronically to the COR.  

The Contractor understands they shall provide subsequent briefing and in-service training for TVHS in support of contractor objectives. This training shall be conducted at no additional cost to the VA. Dates and times of training will be mutually agreed upon between the Contractor and the COR.  The Contractor shall provide training for all sites as deemed necessary to include initial training for Environmental Management Service personnel on any new procedures relative to the handling/processing of the different waste streams. All training schedules shall be coordinated with the COR.

MONETARY RECYCLING CREDIT  
The VA understands the recycling market varies over time with respect to waste streams that have value rather than cost.  The Contractor will furnish to the COR a revised listing of all waste streams with credits reflecting increases or decreases quarterly.  The listing will be broken out by waste stream and when feasible reference industry markets or demands citing increases or decreases. Any monetary recycling credit due to TVHS for recyclable materials will be paid within 30 days of processing materials along with a description of the materials recycled and the credit applied to each category of recyclable materials.  Credits due to TVHS will be paid to the facility through CHECK rather than deducted from the monthly invoice.  The check shall be made out to  Tennessee Valley Healthcare System  and must include the verbiage:  recycling revenue for deposit in FCP 581. 

COMPACTOR REQUIREMENTS
9.1  Maintenance.  The contractor shall maintain all compactors in proper operating condition according to the manufacturer s specifications. 
In the event of failure, the contractor shall respond to the maintenance request within 4 hours from the time the contractor is notified of any failure. Contractor will provide a 24-hour emergency number for TVHS to call in the event of an emergency.  If the contractor cannot repair the compactor(s) within 24 hours of notification, the contractor shall replace the self-contained unit associated with the inoperative compactor with a comparable size open-top container. In this event, unless the self-contained unit is full, the contractor shall not charge TVHS for removal of the waste within the self-contained unit. All repairs shall be accomplished within 72 hours of notification.


Only the contractor s experienced and qualified personnel shall repair and maintain the equipment. In addition, the contractor shall repair and maintain the equipment in accordance with manufacturer s specifications.  There should be no charge to the VA for any repairs or maintenance on Contractor s equipment unless such damage is determined to be due to negligence or vandalism of TVHS.

The contractor shall use compactors that are fully enclosed, vermin-proof, leak-proof, fire-retardant, clean and sanitized.  TVHS reserves the right to request containers be cleaned due to foul odors or other contaminants.  Requests to clean containers will be fulfilled within 24 hours of notification and at no additional charge to TVHS.

All compactors shall include the latest energy efficient technology.  TVHS recommends similar technology to Waste Management s SmartEnergy  Compactors.  Benefits of this technology include: 

Reduction of electricity consumption by as much as 70% versus traditional compactors resulting in lower operating costs and a reduced carbon footprint.
Provides lower energy usage through equal compaction performance and cycle times compared to traditional compactors.
Equipped with compactor monitoring technology.  This enables a waste company to optimize when a compactor needs to be emptied, eliminating unnecessary pickups and greenhouse gas emissions.  
TVHS has the responsibility of being efficient with tax payer dollars.  If the use of this technology indicates that a particular compactor is requiring twice weekly pickup, yet the Service Schedule identified in Section 2.2 indicates four times weekly, then the Contractor will empty the compactor twice weekly and bill TVHS for two pickups.  To maximize efficiency and minimize the impact on the environment, the use of this technology supersedes the Service Schedule in Section 2.2.
Electronic controls are powered by solar energy, while the compactor cycle is traditionally powered. If the compactor doesn t have the maximum solar charge, it is equipped with constant AC-powered backup so that we can always run a cycle while the battery recovers.
The compactor has a  two-speed  system, which actually  downshifts  when it needs more compression and uses less energy than a traditional one-speed system.
Charge box fullness indicator encourages users to run cycles only when needed, reducing our company s electricity usage and carbon footprint.
This technology and equipment is a visible statement to our stakeholders about our commitment to sustainability. 
The Contractor shall submit a cutsheet of the proposed equipment as part of their submittal so it may be reviewed by TVHS officials.

The contractor shall provide self-contained units with permanent hose couplings compatible with the city or town fire department s equipment in which the unit is located.  
9.2  Keys.  All compactors and other equipment that require keys will be keyed alike throughout TVHS.  An adequate supply of keys will be provided to the COR upon request without additional charge.
9.3 Hydraulic Fluid.  All hydraulic equipment shall utilize vegetable or other non-toxic environmentally friendly fluid that will minimize impact to the environment.  Contractor must use all reasonable efforts to mitigate any leaks and all incidents of leaking equipment will be reported to the COR without delay and without failure regardless of the size of the leak.  The Contractor shall submit a cutsheet of the proposed equipment as part of their submittal so it may be reviewed by TVHS.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS
10.1  Licenses/permits. The Contractor shall obtain all licenses and permits necessary to perform the work under the contract.
10.2  Documentation. Contractor will be required to supply monthly data to the COR. This data will include (1) weight of waste picked up at TVHS for the prior month, (2) the cost that TVHS paid to the contractor for the prior month, and (3) the amount of waste diverted toward recycling. All data will be broken down by campus (and satellite locations as applicable). All data will be broken down by disposed/recycled items (eg. Solid Waste, Cardboard, Metal, Yard Waste, etc.) and shall be reported in pounds or tons along with the credit or cost for that category of materials.  All data shall be submitted to the COR by the 7th day of the following month. The COR may provide a standard form to the contractor for the contractor to complete.  See Appendix A for a suggested format.  Contractor will provide Certificates of Recycling or an equivalent to validate material sent for recycling. The data shall be emailed to the COR.  
10.3  Invoicing. Vendor will submit one invoice per campus, monthly in arrears to the VA Electronic Payment System http://www.tungsten-network.com/US/en/veterans-affairs.  Invoice will include the dates of service performed during that month along with the number of containers pulled. Invoice format shall reflect and not deviate from the pricing cost proposal submitted (sample provided below).

TOTAL PRICE
 

For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:

The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but not for more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.

The offeror s initial quote should contain the offeror s best terms from a price standpoint.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote instructions. Offerors may be contacted to resolve minor or clerical errors and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award without further conversations.

Evaluation of Quotes:

The Government will select the quote that represents the best benefit to the Government at a price that can be determined reasonable. The Government will evaluate price, technical capabilities, and past performance. 

Following receipt of quotes, the Government will perform an evaluation using a comparative analysis of the services quoted. The Government will compare quotes to one another to select the service that best benefits the Government by fulfilling the requirement. The evaluation of Government requirements outlined in this request for quote will determine suitability.

Once the Government determines there is/are a contractor(s) that can provide a service that meet(s) the requirements of this request for quote, the Government reserves the right to communicate with only those contractors quoting the best-suited service to address any remaining issues. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. 

The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The period of performance is the following:

Base year: Jan 01, 2019 to Dec 31, 2019
Option Year 1: Jan 01, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020

Direct Comparative Evaluations will be based on the above referenced factor. 

  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items," as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on NIAID-RFQ-19-1933409.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This solicitation is a request for quotes (RFQ). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-100, dated 8/22/18. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541715 with a business size standard of 1000.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) seeks to purchase&nbsp; synthesis of the custom drug KD025 (1.1kg and 500mg). Synthesis needs to be pharmaceutical grade purity, &gt;99% pure.</p>
<p>To be considered for award, offerors must meet the following criteria for the synthesis of the custom drug KD025. This drug will be used in the labs Non_Human Primate NHP study. This drug is needed to observe NHP immune response to HIV infection.  This is a custom drug . It must be synthesized for the lab. The vendor must have the chemical and engineering knowledge to synthesize this custom drug. The vendor must meet the labs scale-up needs all while providing the starting material for the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production. The vendor must provide 1.1kg and 500mg of the custom material, KD25 using the methanesulfonate salt.</p>
<p>The mission at the Vaccine research Center (VRC) is to determine the immune correlates of protection against emerging infectious diseases.  One of the specific aims of the lab is to understand processes that determine the course of human diseases in which the immune system plays a central role in their pathogenesis and outcome. The work in HIV infection in part involves analysis of the clonal composition of CD8 T cells that respond to HIV and the interaction with HIV quasispecies. Escape from adaptive T cell immunity through viral epitope mutation is a major obstacle to the development of vaccines that aim to elicit cellular immunity. The lab is investigating the molecular determinants of this phenomenon at the level of the T cell receptor-epitope contact interface and defining structural motifs that govern the pace and pattern of epitope escape. The practical consequences of findings suggest that vaccine strategies should elicit responding T cells that are qualitatively superior, in terms of clonotypic composition, to those elicited in natural infection.</p>

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
  Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis.  The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

Application for, and use of, badges will be as directed.
  Obtain access to the installation by participating in the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), or by obtaining passes each day from the Base Pass and Identification Office.  Costs for obtaining passes through the NCACS are the responsibility of the Contractor.  One-day passes, issued through the Base Pass and Identification Office, will be furnished without charge.  Furnish a completed EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION (DHS FORM I-9) form for all personnel requesting badges.  This form is available at http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis by searching or selecting Employment Verification (Form I-9).  Allow 7 to 10 days for processing applications for badges.  Immediately report instances of lost or stolen badges to the Contracting Officer.

a.
 NCACS Program:  NCACS is a voluntary program in which Contractor personnel who enroll, and are approved, are subsequently granted access to the installation for a period up to one year, or the length of the contract, whichever is less, and are not required to obtain a new pass from the Base Pass and Identification Office for each visit.  The Government performs background screening and credentialing. Throughout the year the Contractor employee must continue to meet background screening standards. Periodic background screenings are conducted to verify continued NCACS participation and installation access privileges. Under the NCACS program, no commercial vehicle inspection is required, other than for Random Anti-Terrorism Measures (RAM) or in the case of an elevation of Force Protection Conditions (FPCON).
  Information on costs and requirements to participate and enroll in NCACS is available at http://www.rapidgate.com/vendors/how-to-enroll or by calling 1-877-727-4342. Contractors should be aware that the costs incurred to obtain NCACS credentials, or costs related to any means of access to a Navy Installation, are not reimbursable.  Any time invested, or price(s) paid, for obtaining NCACS credentials will not be compensated in any way or approved as a direct cost of any contract with the Department of the Navy.

b. One-Day Passes:  Participation in the NCACS is not mandatory, and if the Contractor chooses to not participate, the Contractors personnel will have to obtain daily passes, be subject to daily mandatory vehicle inspection, and will have limited access to the installation.
 The Government will not be responsible for any cost or lost time associated with obtaining daily passes or added vehicle inspections incurred by non-participants in the NCACS.

c. The Contractor shall obtain the required employee badges and vehicle passes from the Government at his own expense, or daily passes at no additional cost. Each employee shall wear the Government issued badge over the front of the outer clothing.  When an employee leaves the Contractors service, the employees Passes and Badges shall be returned within 5 calendar days.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

The evaluation criteria listed below will be utilized in the slating of AE firms for interviews and the selection of the awardee.
  Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered the most important criteria and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) through (6) are slightly less important than criteria (1)  (4) and equal among themselves; Criteria (7) through (9) are of lesser importance still and equal among themselves.  Failure to provide requested data or to comply with the instructions in this notice could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration.  Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:

Criterion 1 - Specialized Experience (SF-330 Part 1 Section F):  Firms will be evaluated on recent specialized experience and technical competence in performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract through evaluation of experience in:  

1.	Transportation planning involving large military installations including, but not limited to, analysis of specific military user characteristics based upon observations of existing installation characteristics and considering likely deployments and/or return of large numbers of service members.
  

2.	Transportation planning involving areas adjacent to large military installations and requiring negotiation and collaboration with key local, state, and federal stakeholders on issues such as analysis of military travel routes, access points, proposed roadway links, and/or peak hour spreading impacts.  

3.	Traffic engineering projects involving design of Intelligent Transportation Systems adjacent to large military installations that require collaboration with key local, state, and federal stakeholders.  

   Firms may be considered more favorably by demonstrating the following:

1.	Experience with planning projects involving large Navy installations.  

2.	Experience with planning projects involving local Hampton Roads municipalities and/or the Virginia Department of Transportation.
  

Submission Requirements:  Using Section F of the SF-330, the AE firm shall provide information on a minimum of three (3) projects up to a maximum of ten (10) projects completed within the past five (5) years or substantially underway (approximately 80% or more of work complete) that best illustrate the specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above.  

All projects submitted in the SF-330 must have been completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation.  For each submitted project, the offeror shall include the following information:  experience as prime contractor or consultant (please specify), point of contact name, e-mail address, phone number, contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.

<DESC>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily land survey and mapping services in support of the civil works, military and International and Interagency Services (IIS) mission areas. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District (SWG) but up to the Southwestern Division (SWD) area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $10,000,000 and includes a target of two Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than two firms depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $10,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Contractor Manpower Reporting: For any task orders associated with military funding types, the contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the Department of Defense via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/. Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 01 through September 30. While inputs may be reported at any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year, beginning with 2019. Contractors may direct questions to the help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount will be $3,000,000 unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $7,000,000 and includes a target of one (1) Unrestricted A-E IDC and a target of one (1) reserve Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than one (1) firm within each business class depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting.<br />Firms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the solicitation number in PART I, A Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate proposal MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $7,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit these plans during contract negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount for the Unrestricted would be $3,000,000 and for the Small Business reserve would be $150,000, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. All requirements with an estimated value at or below the maximum amount will be reserved for the Small Business class first. Should review of the qualifications of the Small Business firm find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, the government will then proceed to the Unrestricted class. The government will not consider a requirement above the $150,000 threshold to be automatically directed to the Unrestricted class, as the Small Business reserve will be considered first for each requirement irrespective of its estimated value. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

However, it appears that FAR 52.219-14 applies only to set-aside solicitations. Additionally, FAR 52.219-14 is not listed as a Regulatory Cite in SECTION I of the solicitation.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>

<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>

Any requirements within the RFP shall be adhered to.<BR><BR>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer
conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The
following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Delivery - Ability of the offeror to provide the product/services in the time specified in the solicitation document.
Ability to meet specification -Ability of the offeror to provide the product/services based on the specifications as
spelled out in the solicitation shall be included in your proposal package. Material Data Safety Sheet shall be
included in your proposal package.
Past performance
Offerors will be evaluated on their record of relevant, and recent past performance, from the Business Questionnaires
submitted, and information received from past contracts and any additional-data obtained by the Government, i.e.,
current contracts. Relevant past performance is defined as having a record of actual performance or accomplishment in
the production of Wire Decking on contracts similar in scope to the requirement being evaluated. Recent past
performance information is defined as contracts performed within the last three (3) to five (5) years.
In evaluating offerors past performance, the Contracting Officer will consider the following: adherence to contract
schedules, cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and the timeliness of performance taking into
account excusable delays.
Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the corrective action taken.
The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when
evaluating the offerors past performance. Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall
negative trends.
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is
not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
Price
Technical factors are significantly more important than price. Quality, delivery, and customer service will be
evaluated under past performance.
The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors, such as in descending order of importance as listed above
Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror
within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by
either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer),
whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before
award.
The following are the adjectival ratings:
Poor Unfavorable
Marginal More unfavorable than favorable
Good More favorable than unfavorable
Excellent Entirely favorable<BR><BR>(a) Twelve (12) months after contract award date, and every twelve (12) months thereafter, contract prices for the
succeeding twelve (12) month period may be adjusted in accordance with the change in Producer Price Index for
PCU325998325998, "Other miscellaneous chemical product manufacturing" using the simple percentage method described in
the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics "Escalation Guide for Contracting Parties, available at
http://www.bls.gov/ppi/ppiescalation.htm (calculated as follows: index at time of calculation, divided by index at
time base price was set, and the result multiplied by base price, equals adjusted price).")]. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S
RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST THIS ADJUSTMENT.
(b) Adjustments may be requested after the preliminary price index for the month of the anniversary of contract award
has been published but not to exceed 90 days after the eligible adjustment date (i.e., anniversary of the contract
award date). Requests that are made after the 90-day limit will not be honored and the contract pricing will not be
adjusted. The contractor shall submit any requests for adjustments in writing to the contracting officer. Requests
shall include a copy of the relevant index and must be within the allowed time period for adjustment. Any adjustments
authorized as a result of the adjustment request will not be retroactive. The date the completed request is received
by the contracting officer will be the effective date of any changes in price. Economic price increases will not be
granted if the contractor has any past due orders at time of request.
(c) The contractor also is required to request downward price adjustments. All downward adjustments will be
retroactive to the authorized adjustment date as specified in this clause. If downward price adjustments are not
requested and this is later revealed through audits or otherwise, the contractor shall reimburse the Government the
amount overcharged plus interest. Interest will be computed at the rate set annually by the Secretary of the Treasury
for late contract payments. Interest will accrue from the date the adjustment should have been made.<BR><BR>(d) In computing any price adjustment, the preliminary/first-published index for the month and year of contract award
will be compared to the preliminary/first-published index for the contract anniversary month of the adjustment year.
This index is not seasonally adjusted. If this index is temporarily unavailable or permanently discontinued, the
contracting parties shall either use the index one level up (i.e., the broader index under which the selected index
was listed) or agree in writing upon a substitute index.
(e) No adjustment shall be made if the referenced change is less than 2%. Total upward adjustment for the contract
period, including any option periods, shall not exceed 10% of the original contract base price, based on the original
or option period contract price; downward adjustments are not limited.
(f) Indices are available from [SOURCE/CONTACT INFO/WEB ADDRESS (for example "PPI data can be obtained from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics website, by emailing the PPI at ppi-info@bls.gov, or by calling (202) 691-7705.)].<BR><BR>

<DESC><strong><br />***On-Ramp Event Notice***<br /></strong><br /><strong>Once the Government has unencumbered original awards, it is the intent to initiate an on-ramping event, per solicitation section H.40 ON/OFF RAMPING, for the restricted business pool.</strong> <br /><br />A solicitation for an on-ramp event will be open to all eligible potential small business Contractors as early as 30 November 2018. Details on proposal submission and evaluation of the on-ramp event will be provided in the solicitation. It is contemplated that firms will be able to identify their interest and submission for all channels, or for individual channels. Criteria for prioritization of selection across channels will be at the discretion of the SEC. The number of estimated Contractors added as a result of an on-ramp event will be determined at a later date, but the amount of actual awards will be at the sole discretion of the Government. The award of additional ID/IQ Contracts does not increase the overall ceiling or period of performance of the original pool of Contracts. The award of additional ID/IQ Contracts as a result of on-ramping may increase the overall number of Contracts awarded.
<p>Contractors cannot hold more than one ONE IT ID/IQ Contract at any given time. A Contractor cannot be a prime on one team and a subcontractor on another team</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>9&nbsp;Nov&nbsp;2018 Questions and Answers:<br /><br />1. Question:<br />Solicitation FA8526-18-R-0027 page 14, clause c) Welding Certification: calls for AWS D 1.1 is required for welders certification. Is Fusion welding for Aerospace AWS D17.1/D17.1M acceptable for this submission since it is a higher standard? <br />
<p>Government Answer:<br />AWS D17.1 is not appropriate for this application because it is too broad to be of any real use.</p>
<p>Within AWS D17.1 Section 9 for Non-flight Hardware, Table 9.1 directs the user to use AWS D1.1 for the structural welding of steel. Saying that AWS D17.1 is the higher standard is inaccurate since it refers back to D1.1. AWS D17.1 is considered more of a 'catch-all" standard. AWS D1.1 would be the higher standard and should be the one used."</p>
<p>2. Question:<br />For solicitation FA8526-18-R-0027, Ground Handling Cradle, the ATP states to conform to MDC S30006 009 (Critical Item Production Fabrication Specification for Cradle, Ground Handling Equipment ETU 117/E configuration item number 17G0002). This document is not provided in the TDP or the attachments within FBO.</p>
<p>Government Answer: <br />This document establishes the technical requirements for performance, design, development and test for the subject ground handling equipment. The detailed Cradle interface definitions and performance requirements are "flowed" from this critical system interface requirements for the overall C17 program to the applicable individual procurement documents. The upper level interface and engineering requirements of this critical item definition are reflected in the specifications for individual items. The reference in the Cradle specification is solely for informational purposes to show the origin of performance requirements as reflected in the procurement documentation. All detailed and specific engineering requirements are as defined in the TDP.</p>
<p>3. Question:<br />RFQ FA8526-18-R-0027 for 17G230005-1 Ground handling cradle adjoins another open solicitation FA8526-19-R-0005 for part number TT90-F-507, which is the ground handling trailer used in the testing of 17G230005-1 cradle. I am currently putting together the required RFP technical package and was wondering if it would be possible to set up a meeting with the customer for a showcase of our facility for the 17G230005-1 and TT90-F-507 trailers? I do find it is a great value-added activity to have a visual of the manufacturing facility. Please advise if this is something that is possible.</p>
<p>Government Answer:<br />Thank you for the offer of showcasing your manufacturing facility but the government cannot support a meeting.</p>
<p>4. Question:<br />We are considering an 8(a) joint venture. Will this requirement be set-aside for 8(a)?</p>
<p>Government Answer:<br />No, this requirement has been set-aside for Total Small Business.</p>

All technical businesses engaged in AI/ML are invited to submit information on their capabilities (see website listed below for more information). <br />The ARL Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research added the "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" (AI/ML) topic in 2017 under the Information Sciences Campaign. The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning topic can be found by searching announcement "W911NF-17-S-0003" at Grants.gov or FBO.gov.<br />In support of AI prototyping, the DoD is holding an AI Industry Day focusing on the following five areas:<br />1. Training Data: Standardizing, cleansing, preparing, and managing data for AI algorithm training, including new labeling techniques and tools for analytics and metrics of training data<br />2. Algorithms: Frameworks and tools for creating AI/ML algorithms and the algorithms themselves as well as the UIs for the display, search, and interaction with algorithmically derived metadata and tabular structured algorithmic output <br />3. Integration: New or improved processes and methods for integrating AI/ML within warfighting systems, applications, and analysis systems at the edge, or other computation to bring AI/ML to constrained computational environments<br />4. Infrastructure: Storage and indexing capabilities agnostic to data format/type, tools for continuous delivery/deployment of software, and infrastructure monitoring <br />5. Testing: New methods to test, evaluate, and determine the effectiveness of AI/ML approaches</p>
<p><br />The DoD is interested in receiving market research on these 5 focus areas for any data types, techniques, and use cases, with particular interest on the data types, techniques, and uses cases provided below:</p>

A competitive procurement will be issued for Field Service Representatives, Help Desk, Engineering Support and minor enhancements. Various tasks under FALCON will be identified to transfer to HSI's Repository for Analytics in a Virtualized Environment (RAVEn) task order; as an example, these could possibly include DARRTS, Tip Line, and HSI Mobile. Once these tasks have been identified, an overall comprehensive competition will be conducted for those portions of the FALCON system which will not be re-developed by the RAVEn team.

<p>This synopsis is amended to add additional scope to this effort as follows:</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a five (5) year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract and orders issued thereunder to Micro Systems, Inc. (MSI), on a sole source basis in support of the System for Naval Target Control (SNTC) program for the Department of Defense. In addition to the supplies and services outlined at fbo.gov posting N00019-17-R-0085, the original synopsis for this effort, the contract will be structured to also allow for the procurement of services related to investigations for systems integration, integration test support, testing of compatibility and performance testing of software and hardware with existing and future designs, regressing testing, integration engineering support, investigative engineering analysis, field and in-plant engineering assistance, engineering studies, engineering technical consultation, SNTC design specification updates, and associated technical documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSI is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the SNTC (all blocks) systems, as well as the sole integrator of their proprietary systems into Navy targets; therefore, MSI is the only Contractor with the requisite knowledge, proprietary rights, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements for the SNTC systems. It is for these reasons that NAVAIR intends to procure under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C) (1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact MSI directly. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. No telephone responses will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Project # 503-15-103,  Renovate Specialty Care  (Revised 11/09/2018)

This announcement is for the selection of an Architect / Engineer Firm to perform design services, technical specifications, working drawings, cost estimates, as-built drawings, construction period services, and site visits for the Construction of Project # 503-15-103,  Renovate Specialty Care  at the VA Medical Center in Altoona, PA.  The magnitude of construction for the above referenced project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  The Construction Period services are expected to begin following the issuance of the Construction Notice To Proceed.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract will be awarded to the A/E Firm selected for the aforementioned design services.  The most highly qualified A/E Firm will be required to participate in a Preproposal Conference prior to the submission of price proposals.  Any cost associated with the participation in the Preproposal Conference is not reimbursable.  Contract award is subject to the availability of funds for FY 2019.

Please note this is not a request for proposal.  Eligible responses received will be evaluated and the most highly qualified will be compiled on a shortlist of candidates who will be contacted for an interview.  The following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate firms and determine the most highly qualified firm for possible contract award. The Professional Qualification and Specialized Experience/Technical Competence (i.e., Evaluation Factors #1 & #2) factors are slightly more important than the other six factors (i.e. Evaluation Factors #3, #4, #5, #6, #7 and #8).  

1.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services:  This factor evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the design team.  The firms should provide information on the individuals from each relative discipline that are anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the design team.  The key positions should include Project Managers, Quality Assurance Managers, Architect, Plumbing Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Fire Protection Engineers, Interior Designer, Estimator, Environmental Engineers and strong familiarity in sustainable design and energy efficiency.  

2.  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the type of work required: This factor evaluates the experience of the firm and design team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for this contract. 
Part 1: This project will remodel the old surgery area for Specialty Care. This project will aid the medical center in designing a Veteran-centric health care system with the required infrastructure to help Veterans navigate the healthcare delivery system and receive coordinated Specialty Care. This project should reduce waiting times by addressing non-face-to-face care. This project supports Specialty Care programs. Specialty Care is fast growing and is a multidisciplinary approach to our Veterans Health Care needs. Specialty Care has outgrown its current space and needs to expand into the old Surgery space.  Extra consideration may be given for experience designing projects for Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities, especially Operating Room design experience.  The intent of this project is to provide the Government with constructible documents detailing how to accomplish the above; it is estimated that approximately 366 sf of Common space will also have to be renovated. It is estimated that the total renovated space is approximately 8,274 sf. The exact allocation of space remains to be determined. Design shall plan to install insulation within interior walls for sound dampening and to help with temperature control; install energy efficient lighting; replace pneumatic heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) with Direct Digital Control; and plan to fix lack of insulation problem with window frames.  
PART 2: This project will remodel the old ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for the Infusion Clinic that is part of Surgery, and to provide a Wound Care Suite that is part of Acute Medicine & Procedure Clinic Service administration in accordance with workload and space criteria. It is estimated that this project will renovate approximately 3,241 square feet of old ICU and Common space for aforementioned functions. This project will aid the medical center in designing a Veteran-centric health care system with the required infrastructure to help Veterans navigate the healthcare delivery system and receive coordinated Specialty and Primary care. This project should reduce waiting times by addressing non-face-to-face care. This project supports the Specialty Care program and the Wound Care Primary Care program. Specialty Care is fast growing and is a multidisciplinary approach to our Veterans Health Care needs. Specialty Care has outgrown its current space by virtue of needing space for the Infusion Clinic and needs to expand into the old ICU space. The facility doesn't currently have permanent space for an Infusion Clinic or a Wound Care Suite and this project provides permanent space for both. To accomplish the above; it is estimated that approximately 3,016 square feet of old ICU space will have to be renovated for Specialty Care. This project will also provide a wound care suite in permanent space which will require approximately 225 square feet of old ICU space/Common space to be renovated and converted from Specialty Care to Primary Care. The exact allocation of space remains to be determined.  Firms may submit any other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in Specialized Experience.  

3.  Past Performance on Contracts with Government Agencies (particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and Private Industry in Terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules:  This factor shall be evaluated based on the information provided by the A-E on similar type projects, performance appraisals on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs, any Government sponsored performance rating system and contact with personnel listed in the SF 330 regarding past performance as well board members personal knowledge of the firm.  

4.  Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time:  This factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the projects in the required time.  

5.  Location in General Geographical Area of the Project and Knowledge of the Locality of the Project:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center), and knowledge of the geographic area.  The personnel identified as the key design team staff are expected to work in the design office identified for evaluation of this factor.  

6.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.  

7.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  

8.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

<p><strong>So, what exactly is HUD contemplating acquiring?</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) office of Single Family Asset Management (OSFAM) is seeking information that will assist in procurement and implementation of a business intelligence (BI) and integrated analytics platform as well as an associated front-end interface for external end users to support current and future HUD initiatives and requirements. <br />The Department intends to procure the services of a business service provider to provide a state-of-the-art web-based system with current technologies and technical capabilities, to design best practices and other factors that allow flexible manipulation of data, to deliver specific, well-defined projects, and to train the HUD user on full utilization of the system.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an organizational unit within HUD, administers the single-family mortgage insurance program. FHA insures approved lenders against the risk of loss on loans they finance for the purchase, and in some instance rehabilitation, of single-family homes. When an FHA insured loan goes into default, the lender is required to evaluate each defaulted borrower for loss mitigation, and if loss mitigation is not feasible, to commence foreclosure. Following foreclosure, the lender conveys the foreclosed property to HUD and files a claim for insurance benefits.<br />The National Servicing Center (NSC) is a division of the OSFAM that provides national servicing and loss mitigation support to FHA lenders and borrowers in the form of client-based loss mitigation assistance and servicing complaint resolution assistance. NSC also monitors loan servicing activities of all FHA approved servicers, evaluates risk to the FHA fund through statistical analysis, reviews default and foreclosure data for program study, and manages FHA assigned and subordinate loans owned by HUD known as the Secretary-Held portfolio. <br />HUD utilizes a variety of systems to store information relating to approximately 8.0 million active insured single-family loans. FHA loan data is stored the Single Family Housing Enterprise Data Warehouse (SFHEDW), and is utilized by the NSC to identify trends, program successes and failures relating to servicing activities, to analyze the impact of risk on the FHA insurance fund, and to monitor lender performance. <br />Currently, the National Servicing Center (NSC) utilizes a web-based system, Single Family-Data Analysis and Reporting Tool (SF-DART), which houses many of the reports used by the OSFAM and other HUD clients. The current platform is built on SAS version 9.4. The SAS licenses are owned and customized by a Contractor under the direction of HUD. The SAS environment requires a minimum of a three-tier server design and is located outside of the HUD firewall. In addition, the Contractor hosts software applications on its own servers within its facilities and provide for database and programming administration, backup processing, hardware and software acquisition, support, and maintenance. The contractor provides administrative and security rights and access to the SAS environment via the web portal.<br /><br /><strong>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK</strong><br />The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) office of Single Family Asset Management (OSFAM) is seeking information that will assist in procurement and implementation of a business intelligence (BI) and integrated analytics platform as well as an associated front-end interface for external end users to support current and future HUD initiatives and requirements. <br />The Department intends to procure the services of a business service provider to provide a state-of-the-art web-based system with current technologies and technical capabilities, to design best practices and other factors that allow flexible manipulation of data, to deliver specific, well-defined projects, and to train the HUD user on full utilization of the system.<br />The Department intends to use this BI/Analytics platform for integrated analytics, ad hoc report development, and geo-graphing capabilities; the system should integrate, analyze, and manage the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family insured loan data across space and time.

<DESC>The proposed action will be for up to 26,200 Joint Personal Dosimeters - Individual (JPD-IND), conformance<br />testing, and technical data. The JPD-IND is a rugged Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC)<br />Battlefield Dosimeter that replaces legacy radiological dose measurement devices. JPD-IND will provide a joint<br />solution that eliminates parts obsolescence, increases capability, reduces life-cycle costs, and addresses<br />Operation TOMODACHI lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and<br />common units of measure, replacing the legacy systems, the PDR-75/DT-236 and the PDR-75A/DT-236A series<br />systems. The JPD-IND system is envisioned to include a real-time, self-indicating dosimeter unit with inherent<br />measurement and display capabilities, and to be worn on the wrist or chest. Data transfer is will occur via<br />connectivity to existing situational awareness and mission command systems and tactical networks.

Topic N07-034 was titled "Military Training Systems Acceptance Test &amp; Evaluation." IDT, VTAS, and QuantaDyn were subsequently awarded SBIR Phase II contract numbers N61339-08-C-0025 on 17 April 2008, N61339-08-C-0033 on 10 July 2008, and N61339-08-C-0033 on 19 February 2009 respectively. IDT was awarded SBIR Phase III contract number N68936-11-D-0005 on 16 October 2010. IDT was awarded SBIR Phase II.5 contract number N68335-14-C-0314 on 12 July 2014. IDT was awarded SBIR Phase III BOA N68335-15-G-0039 on 8 August 2015, and eight orders to date have been placed against the BOA.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Topic N07-034 sought the development of a standardized and automated approach to acceptance testing for the wide range of complex training systems planned for use in the Navy. The Navy's flight and maintenance training simulators systems were growing in complexity, becoming increasingly dependent on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Hardware and Software, as well as the successful re-use of software developed from other programs. Despite the advances in development practices and tools, the goals of accelerating the rate at which training systems can be delivered, and accepted, while reducing their costs cannot be met without comparable improvement in the practices and tools for acceptance testing. Training system deficiencies that are not identified and corrected during testing have resulted in reduced performance and training effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Phase I sought to rapidly accelerate the ability to deliver advanced capabilities of training systems. This was accomplished by significantly reducing the overall acceptance testing timeframe through the use of commercial testing automation tools, which are either existing or emerging, throughout the test and evaluation life cycle.</span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Flatiron/Dragados/Sukut Joint Venture (FDS) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B) - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". A Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) to modify the existing Isabella Lake Dam Safety Project (DSMP) contract to include work on an adjacent U.S. Forest Service (USFS) recreational boat launch facility on Lake Isabella has been prepared in support of this out of scope modification. Firms believing they can provide these supplies or services above must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses should be emailed to the Government point of contact for this acquisition. Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.) in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 237990 which is $36.5 Million. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a request for proposal. Questions concerning this action should be directed to Melissa DeNigris by email at Melissa.A.DeNigris@usace.army.mil.<br /><br />Responses must be received by 24 November 2018.
