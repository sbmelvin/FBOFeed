<DESC> <br> Synoposis <br>  <br> US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Division (ACC-APG ED) on the behalf of the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) intends to formally post solicitation W911SR-14-R-0003 as a result of the draft solicitation W911SR-13-R-0026, for the Chemical Fingerprint Identification System (CFIS) on February 24, 2014.  Proposals shall be submitted by April 8, 2014 in order to be considered for award. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  <br>   <br> Classification/NAICS Code: 334516.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this acquisition is to procure prototypes for the Chemical Fingerprint Identification System (CFIS). <br>  <br> The contract will be carried out in two phases: <br>  	Phase I: Design:  Up to two (2) awards will be made and each contractor will have six (6) months to design and detail a functional CFIS unit. <br>  	Phase II: Build (Option):  Upon Government review and acceptance of a proposed design, the selected vendor(s) will have twelve (12) months to build up to two (2) identical CFIS units. <br>  <br> The CFIS Prototype Design Phase I: ECBC requires contractor support to design and build two (2) man portable prototype Chemical Fingerprint Identification Systems (CFIS) that can identify trace levels of exogenous materials contained within fingerprints/partial-prints/and palm prints. The system has to produce two main results: 1) capture a bright field image (photograph) of the entire examined sample at a level of 1000 dpi or greater and, 2) locate, detect, and identify exogenous materials found within the minutiae and ridges of a fingerprint sample.  The Department of Defense (DOD) must have the capability to non-invasively, non-destructively collect fingerprints from potential target materials (or directly) and sequentially identify chemical materials that may be present. This is to directly link the fingerprint sample to the individual and detect possible threat related materials found on the persons' residual biometric. <br>  <br>  <br> Upon successful completion of the CFIS prototype Design Phase, the government intends to exercise an Option for Prototype Building (Phase II).  During this phase, the primary function of the CFIS unit is to rapidly perform all desired operations (less than 20 minutes) leading to an output final response with confidence that can be used to detect, identify, and warn personnel of the presence of potentially illicit materials from a sample (or direct print). <br>  <br>  The Government anticipates soliciting proposals on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion form basis.  The subsequent contracts will be for prototype development and test support. This effort will be a 100% Total Small-Business Set Aside. <br>  <br> The solicitation will include the following documents: CFIS Performance Specification, Performance Work Statement, Contract Data Requirements List, Evaluation Criteria, Sample Proposals, and Exercise of Option Information. <br>  <br> Telephone inquires will not be accepted. Please forward any questions in writing to the Contract Specialist William Mebane  at william.e.mebane2.civ@mail.mil <br>

INVITATION FOR OFFER - FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IFO NO. BLM-2014-CHEU-001 April 2014 - March 2015
Introduction The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 6- to 7-year life of this project.
NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport daily or when needed.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs, but BLM will pay demerge charges if BLM facility takes longer than 1 hour to complete  liquids pickup and BLM is at fault for transportation delays.  BLM will not pay demerge charges on delays caused by receiving activity, weather, or any other circumstances outside of BLM's Control.
Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct consisting of such components as Methane, C2-Ethane, C3-Propane, NC4-Normal Butane, IC4-Iso Butane and C5-Natural Gas.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact Samuel R. M. Burton at 806-356-1025.
You must submit a written offer via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on March 21, 2014. We estimate awarding a contract by  March 28, 2014. .  You may call Samuel R. M. Burton by phone at 806-356-1025, or E-Mail at sburton@blm.gov, with questions regarding this IFO.
Offers The Exhibit is the offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred indexprices and total estimated amount per base year and each of four option years, etc.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  
Bidder proposals will be accepted any time up to March 7, 2014, Please contact Samuel R. M. Burton for an offer sheet and fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address:
BLM - Amarillo Field Office 801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500 Amarillo, TX  79101 Attn:  Samuel R. M. Burton
Consideration of Offers BLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.
The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLM's judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions.
Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a partys assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction. 
Term Initial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence April 1, 2014.  The delivery period will be for the term ending March 31, 2015, unless  the BLM cancels the transaction for convenience of the government or for breach of the following contract terms by the offeror.  
The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
(1) The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct; (2) Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or (3) The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM.
The BLM may also unilaterally exercise one or more of four one year option periods by written notice to the offeror.
Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas Liquids The buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site.
No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period.

<DESC><p><br />The U.S. Department of Labor is soliciting offers from qualified construction contractors that have the qualifications and experience for the construction of a new LEED Silver Certified cafeteria at the Sierra Nevada Job Corps Center. This is a two-phase project. Phase 1 will consist of the construction of a new cafeteria building totaling approximately 16,500 gross square feet. This work will include miscellaneous site improvements in the form of general landscaping, service yard, entry road, parking, drainage, connection to all utility lines and site/security lighting for the new building. Phase 2 will require the demolition of the existing 20,130 gross square foot cafeteria building.

The estimated cost range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Plans and specifications will be made available at a later date. This is a 100% small business set aside acquisition under NAICS Code 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Miscellaneous construction services are required, throughout the term of the contract, for alteration, extension, conversion, and/or modernization of existing facilities, as well as new construction. These services will be required for commercial, industrial, and utility type of facilities located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required for all work as described in the applicable contract documents.

Multiple contract awards are contemplated, in each of the trades; general, electrical and mechanical.  Each contract will be for a 1-year base period, with three 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Task orders will be placed against the contracts to fund projects throughout the year.  

Requirements under these contracts can range from $1,000-$750,000 each.  It is estimated that $8.5 million in task orders will be issued in four (4) years under the general construction multiple award contracts, $8.5 million under electrical construction contracts, with $3 million in mechanical construction task orders over four years.  

Request for proposals and award of task orders will be specific to projects in excess of $50,000 [Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1] and less than $50,000 [CLIN 2].  

Requests for proposals for projects estimated to be greater than $50,000 will be issued to all contract holders for that construction trade, and will be accompanied by detailed specifications and construction drawings.  It is anticipated that award of task orders will be based on price, quality and timeliness.

Expedited competitive procedures; e.g., rapid turn-around times (TAT)/completion dates, generally under 15 days, will be detailed in the contracts for projects estimated to be less than $50,000.  In addition, it is anticipated that projects estimated to be less than $10,000 could be awarded by a designated Ordering Official on a more informal basis.  Approximately 150 work orders were issued in 2013 for general, electrical and mechanical construction projects under $50,000 each for an estimated total of $400,000 for the year.

The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals for requirements below the $50,000.00 threshold under CLIN 2 and requirements above the $50,000 threshold under CLIN 1, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government

Due to the need for fast turn-around times for meetings, completion of projects, etc., contractors must have a primary location within the state of Oklahoma.  

The NAICS codes applicable to these requirements are 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction (small business size standard-$33.5 million), 238210-Electrical Contractors (business size standard-$14 million) and 238220-Plumbing, Heating and Air-Conditioning Contractors (business size standard-$14 million).

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (Including brand-name) to Thomson Reuters, 1500 Spring Garden Street, Philidelphia, PA 19130 for analysis of scientific productivity of NIH awardees using a database of scientific literature.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 519130 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency, making important discoveries that improve health and save lives. The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) is the portal for NIH grant applications and their review for scientific merit. CSR receives all research grant applications sent to NIH and handles the review of more than 70% of those by organizing peer review groups (study sections) to evaluate research grant applications. CSR's mission is to see that NIH grant applications receive fair, independent, expert, and timely reviews, free from inappropriate influences, so NIH can fund the most promising research.</p>
<p>The Office of Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation (OPAE) at CSR is establishing an information technology infrastructure and seeks access to a bibliometric database which will enable large scale batch queries for bibliometric records and associated citation metrics. This information will enable CSR to establish relationships between applicants and reviewers so CSR can understand where fields of study and scientific expertise overlap.</p>
<p>CSR began work on an information system to link scientific publications to grants and investigators in December 2011 through acquisition of a one year license from Thomson-Reuters [20130116814]. Considerable effort has been expended on developing the tool for CSR's purpose (approximately 0.5 FTE of a PhD level analyst) and significant progress has been made. CSR would like to extend the contract by another year to take advantage of the extensive customizations that has been invested. CSR is also interested in including two, 12 month options in the resulting contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The Director of the National Institutes of Health has commissioned a committee consisting of senior staff to evaluate, at high priority, the organizational structure of peer review and its impact on the scientific community for the purpose of identifying any improvements that could be designed and implemented to ensure that the very best scientific ideas are supported with taxpayer funds. The purpose of this acquisition is to ensure adequate technical resources to fulfill the objectives of the committee. A critical aspect of this study is to enumerate and evaluate the scientific publications that are attributable to NIH funded research. This requires access to one or more bibliographic databases. Unfortunately, none of the available sources is ready to use for CSR's purposes- thus extensive customization is required.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>One year base period and two one year option periods.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>CSR requires access to an abstract and citation bibliometric database of the peer reviewed scientific literature that meets the following requirements:<br />&bull; The database must be multidisciplinary with a high degree of coverage of the peer-reviewed publications from the sciences and social sciences;<br />&bull; The database must include cover-to-cover indexing of the highest impact journals world-wide;<br />&bull; Coverage must include the years 2000-2014;<br />&bull; The database must provide professional level search and analysis capabilities such as retrieving all records corresponding to a list of up to 5,000 first and last names submitted in batch queries; <br />&bull; The Contractor must provide the data in a form that it can be installed on a Structured Query Language (SQL) database, on a secure server within the National Institutes of Health with access permitted only to those individuals authorized by the terms of the license; <br />&bull; At least 5 NIH users will require access to the database;<br />&bull; The Contractor must provide a detailed description of how the data will be provided, descriptions of data elements and field names, and sample queries plus technical support for CSR's database programmer;<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide CSR with full data rights to the data retrieved by query including individual records. These data will be used for internal operations analysis and may be submitted for publication in aggregate form with full attribution to the source of the data.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the Sole/Single Source Justification that is attached to this Notice of Intent.</p>
<p>In the specialized case of the proposed limited scope project which has been designated as high priority by NIH, Thomson-Reuters is the only responsible source of the services being sought. The cost of recreating the database from the previous year's work using a different vendor would be approximately four times higher not counting staff salary time. Using an alternative vendor would also involve an incubation time while they established familiarity with the data at hand and would involve rebuilding the data base using the alternative vendor's technology, then cross-validating it against the data generated for CSR by NETE/STS. This would add considerable cost to the project as well as time.</p>
<p>Thomson-Reuters was previously awarded a contract on a best value basis following a full and open competition to provide a bibliometric database for CSR. Its proposal was judged most technically acceptable and is of best value to the Government. These data now represent the base infrastructure that is critical for the proposed studies. CSR staff has experience in working with Thomson-Reuter's data. The most simple and cost-effective path forward would be to extend those studies rather than rebuild them using a different set of technologies which would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that will not be recovered through competition. In addition, this will create unacceptable delays in fulfilling this specialized requirement.</p>

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

The purpose of this statement is to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and to prevent an unfair competitive advantage. The following subsections prescribe a non-exhaustive list of limitations on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest. <br>  <br> a. If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide systems engineering and technical direction for a system, but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, integration, assembly, checkout or production, the contractor shall not be awarded a subsequent contract to supply the system or any of its major components, or to act as consultant to a supplier of any system, subsystem, or major component utilized for or in connection with any item or other matter that is (directly or indirectly) the subject of the systems engineering and technical direction. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract and for two (2) years thereafter. <br>  <br> b. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare and furnish complete specifications covering non- developmental items, to be used in a competitive acquisition, the contractor shall not be permitted to furnish these items, either as a prime or subcontractor. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract performance and for either two (2) years thereafter or the duration of the initial production contract whichever is longer. This rule shall not apply to contractors who furnish specifications or data at Government request or to situations in which contractors act as Government representatives to help Government agencies prepare, refine or coordinate specifications, provided this assistance is supervised and controlled by Government representatives. <br>  <br> c. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare or assist in preparing a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services, the contractor shall not supply the system, its major components, or the service unless the contractor is the sole source, the contractor has participated in the development and design work, or more than one contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement. The term of this prohibition shall endure for two (2) years. <br>  <br> d. If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide technical evaluation of products or advisory and assistance services, the contractor shall not provide such services if the services relate to the contractor's own or a competitor's products or services unless proper safeguards are established to ensure objectivity. <br>  <br> e.  If, under this announcement, any personnel of the prime firm or any subcontractor at any tier previously served with the procuring agency in a capacity that provided access to non-public, competitively useful information relevant to the requirements giving rise to this procurement activity, the prime contractor or subcontractor shall avoid deriving an unfair competitive advantage, or the appearance of an unfair competitive advantage, by precluding the use of such non-public, competitively useful information in the preparation of any document responsive to any request of the procuring agency pursuant to this procurement activity.   <br>

This effort also supports users outside the AFSC. The AF must continue to proactively improve logistics support and system sustainability. The AF users must be able to status parts across multiple weapon system platforms which require linking of the data in order to run necessary queries and reports from a single access point. This effort will help assure all required parts and materials to support AFSC managed weapon systems are available within acceptable production lead times. In addition, the effort will reduce the overall cost of ownership of the weapon systems by, (1) facilitating economical DMSMS resolution costs, (2) reducing the number of reactive solutions, (3) minimizing any delays in organic depot-level repair as well as Contractor repair, and (4) improving system availability. <br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The AF technical data is considered For Official Use Only (FOUO) and must be protected as such.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY: <br>  <br> THIS RFI WITH ADDITIONAL GRAPHICS CAN BE FOUND AT THE LINK BELOW: <br> https://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm <br>  <br> This is a market survey Request for Information (RFI) in support of the development of a Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS) Framework (MAF).  This RFI is issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Warren, MI, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information on key features for a MAPS Framework (MAF) as a development platform for the Army Survivability community.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.  Although  quote mark proposal quote mark  and  quote mark offeror quote mark  are used in this Request for Information, all responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This solicitation is for the purpose of socializing the MAF concept with Industry and receiving input to guide the step-wise development which will culminate in the incorporation of COTS/MOTS equipment which is MAF compliant. <br>  <br> MAPS OVERVIEW: <br>  <br> The intent of the MAPS Program is to design, develop, and test a MAPS Controller (MAC) and a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)-based Open Architecture that integrates multiple APS material solutions / configurations in a manner that results in significant reductions in overall cost, schedule, and risk.  The MAPS program will specify, validate, demonstrate, and maintain the MOSA-based system architecture, known as the MAPS Framework (MAF), for the integration of Active Protection System (APS) components, i.e. sensors, countermeasures, and related items of equipment on US Army ground vehicle platforms.  The goals are to optimize requirements, improve on technology transitions, and provide evolutionary growth in capabilities.  MAF standards will be developed in cooperation with industry and will be open to support multi-vendor implementation.  It is the intent for these standards to be used in future acquisition of active protection system components.  Implementation of the Modular APS Framework (MAF) allows platform systems to share and customize APS suites and to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design.   <br>  <br> TOPIC: <br>  <br> The Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground System Survivability (GSS) group is conducting a market survey soliciting information from industry concerning existing, proven technology solutions to develop a MAF baseline.  The baseline will consist of Computing and Interface hardware, the Modular APS Controller (MAC), in addition to MAF-conformant software architecture.  TARDEC will use the MAF design concept and open standards to develop a lab-based prototype MAPS, to support system and subsystem software development, testing, and demonstrations.  TARDEC plans to eventually acquire and host 3rd party developed MAF-conformant hardware and software components in the MAPS Lab to analyze acquisition strategies, system integration (i.e. software and hardware validation and test) and evaluate safety (AFSRB) certification implications.  Responses will help inform the determination of MAPS interoperability profiles used in future MAPS acquisition performance specifications and requirement documents. <br>  <br> The MAF is envisioned to include: <br>  <br> -- An architecture, which defines common terminology, systems, components, and interfaces.  <br>  <br> -- Set of reference designs. <br>  <br> -- A phased set of standard specifications covering the capabilities needed to integrate MAPS mission equipment /configuration items (CIs), platform applications and interfaces. <br>  <br> -- Open standard physical and logical interfaces among system and APS components <br>  <br> -- Set of shared communication services. <br>  <br> -- Common and approved hardware and software information assurance (IA) components to enable systems integrators to build security designs that protect and control access to information in compliance with the Army IA regulations. <br>  <br> -- Joint Service Weapon Safety Review Board reviewed safety approaches (although each Hardware, Software and Firmware configuration will be approved and certified) <br>  <br> A Government-Industry standards body will develop the MAF standard specifications.  This body follows an  quote mark adopt-adapt-author quote mark  methodology in the effort to move towards establishing a set of common open standards for use within the vehicle and mission system communities. These standards will be independent of specific hardware, software or firmware solutions. <br>  <br> Modular and open hardware configuration is intended to mean: <br>  <br> -- Deploy software i.e. addition of Software Configuration Items (SCI's) and applications (SLOC and throughput growth) w/o adding or replacing Hardware Configuration Items (HCIs). <br>  <br> -- Deploy hardware additions while enabling software reuse. <br>  <br> -- Modular hardware design counts for: Reconfigurable I/Os, power channels, signals, discretes, multiple interface protocols, busses bandwidth, CPU throughput, memory types and total budget used vs. reserve values to support growth. <br>  <br> -- Provide for low, medium, or high level of protection hardware solutions. <br>  <br> -- Integrated Electronics Environment that supports LRM designs with spare backplane slots. <br>  <br> -- Capable of self test (ST, BIT/BID), report and fault isolate to its line replaceable module and component's malfunctions. <br>  <br> -- Supports and interact with the host Vehicle's Health Management System (VHMS). <br>  <br> Conceptual Architectural Diagrams <br>  <br> Refer to Figure-1:  The MAF will include a Modular APS Controller (MAC) and will provide and define the primary interfaces and controls between the APS sensors, the counter measures, switching devices and the host vehicle.  Both Conceptual Architecture represented in Figure 2 and 3 are notional and they currently under evaluations by the USG.  The interested parties are encouraged to provide us with feedback comments, enhancements, Pros/Cons on both concepts, and their design concept. <br>  <br> The MAC may perform all critical processing such as target / threat classification, tracking of all direct-fire threats from a ground based adversary, 360 degrees, and countermeasure activation, as in Figure 2.  Alternately, the MAC may perform minimal processing and act as a system arbitrator for the activation of countermeasures and provide an interface between the system and the host vehicle/system operator as in Figure 3. <br>  <br> Communication Protocol Options <br>  <br> A significant task in the development of the MAF will be the selection of communication protocols.  This selection will be influenced by factors such as latency/ bandwidth, security/information assurance, and scalability.  It is not expected that the architecture will have only a single protocol for everything APS.  Rather, responses to this RFI will shed light on the system requirements and data transfer needs which will drive the protocol selection.  Additionally, this selection will be impacted by existing APS communication protocols and the potential impact to existing industry technology.  Protocol selection will also be influenced by safety requirements of the Army Fuse Safety Review Board (AFSRB) which must certify these systems.  The Government is investigating the following candidates believed capable of gigabit per second performance: <br>  <br>   1) IEEE 802.3 based AFDX / ARINC 664 Part 7 <br>  <br>   2) IEEE 1394b based SAE AS5643A (@ S800) <br>  <br>   3) TTE based SAE AS6802  <br>  <br>   4) IEEE 802.3 and IETF COTS internet based <br>  <br> Communication Considerations <br>  <br> -- The MAF will provide the interfaces among the countermeasures, controller, sensors and other APS components. Consider the overall time budget to defeat every threat. Provide the analysis behind each design approach in-regards to the selection of each protocol. <br>  <br> -- The MAF will provide the capabilities to exchange data with the host vehicle protocols and the MAF e.g. CAN, 1553, serial buses etc. in additions to the required interface and control with the crew station. <br>  <br> -- Total time required to detect, identify, classify, process and defeat threats.  A breakdown of time allocations consumed by each element of the MAPS is recommended. Interested parties shall justify their proposed time allocations, i.e. measured, tested, Modeling and Simulation, analysis, calculated, etc. <br>  <br> -- The MAF will support multiple enclaves for data processing, storage and exchange according to their classification and comply with the DoD regulations. <br>  <br> RESPONSES: <br>  <br> MAF RFI Responses must be post marked by February 28, 2014. <br>  <br> Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to: DAMI_TARDEC_GSS_AP.C@conus.army.mil ; include name, phone number and email address for a response.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or HUB Zone small businesses that can provide a K-B (Kirkpatrick-Baez) mirror pair. The mirror pair will be used in on-going testing and research to better understand how proteins function in time-resolved x-ray studies. The mirror pair is needed to focus x-rays. Further, a Secondary Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) X-ray mirror system is needed to tailor the X-ray spot size and divergence. This mirror system will facilitate at least a two-fold extension into the small-angle X-ray scattering region (SAXS), which will allow time-resolved SAXS/WAXS studies of particles more than twice as large as that achievable without this K-B mirror system. Moreover, the ability to shrink the X-ray spot size at the sample location by up to a factor of four will enable time-resolved Laue crystallography studies of much smaller crystals, and will extend the time-resolved capabilities to systems for which the photo reaction is irreversible. These improvements will enlarge significantly the scope of systems that can be incisively studied on this time-resolved beamline, including protein systems whose function is biomedically relevant to human health.
<p><br />Period of Performance: <br />The custom-built K-B mirror system must ready for shipping to BioCARS by Sept. 12, 2014, with shipping costs will be covered by a separate invoice. Upon acceptance of the K-B mirror system (see Inspection and Acceptance Requirements), the vendor will submit to an invoice.</p>
<p>The x-ray pair must be able to: <br />To integrate a K-B mirror system with existing components on the BioCARS beamline, it must fit within a 400x575 mm (WxL) footprint, with dowel pin holes on the underside of the baseplate to facilitate registration between the baseplate and an optical table with an array of 1" tapped holes. The horizontal and vertical focusing mirrors should be made of silicon, have a surface roughness of &le;1&Aring;, and have adjacent to their center line 5-mm wide Rhodium and 4-mm wide bare Silicon stripes. The length of the mirrors should be 240 mm with an active optical length of 200 mm. The mirrors must be supported on mechanical benders capable of achieving an elliptical curvature with &le;1 &mu;rad slope error. The K-B mirror system must provide stepper-motor control of mirror curvature, pitch, and translation, with precision home switches integrated to fiducialize the motors after system start up. The mirror curvature should be controllable from flat to &lt; 150 m radius of curvature. The mirror pitch should be controlled to a precision of 2-3 &mu;rad, and the mirror translation to 0.1 &mu;m. The vertical focusing mirror should be downward deflecting on the upstream side of the enclosure, and the horizontal mirror should deflect the beam to the left (when looking downstream). All motorized controls must be repeatable with the angular deflection set to be complementary to that generated by the Primary K-B mirrors, which typically operate at 3.8 mrad angle of incidence. The mirrors must also provide manual adjustments to align the mirrors with respect to the optical table, and set the horizontal and vertical mirrors orthogonal to each other. The entire K-B mirror assembly must be enclosed within a transparent, helium-purged box. The working distance between the exit face of the enclosure and the sample position shall be ~200 mm. This Secondary K-B mirror system will be used to re-image the X-rays passing through one of two pairs of upstream X-ray slits onto the sample position. The upstream X-ray slits will be located &le;1.4 m upstream from the center of the horizontal focusing mirror, which will facilitate up to 4X demagnification at the sample position. The throughput of the mirror system should be &ge; 70% at 12 keV and 3.8 mrad angle of incidence. Vendors capable of meeting the K-B mirror specifications and delivery schedule must submit for approval diagrams, plans, estimates, and other supporting information that the vendor believes to be relevant to this procurement.</p>
<p>After placement of the order, NIDDK will consult with the vendor regarding locations for alignment pins and tapped holes on the underside of the K-B mirror system, and will supply drawings indicating their placement. NIDDK will also coordinate shipping and customs paperwork through a broker having prior experience with both the APS and the vendor.</p>
<p>The motion control systems required to operate the K-B mirror system will be acquired by BioCARS and integrated into their beam line control system in advance of the required delivery date.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>Upon delivery to BioCARS, an NIDDK representative will be onsite to inspect the contents and certify safe arrival of the K-B mirror system. This system must be tested with X-rays before final acceptance. This testing is tentatively planned for the first week of Oct. 2014, after the APS resumes operation following a month-long shutdown. NIDDK and the BioCARS beam line staff will perform the required tests and certify whether the mirror system meets the required specifications. NIDDK is responsible for final acceptance of the system, upon which NIDDK will pay the vendor the quoted cost.</p>
<p>NIDDK Property</p>
<p>An NIDDK/NIH representative will travel to BioCARS to assist with the integration and testing of the K-B mirror system. An NIH property sticker will be affixed to the K-B Mirror system, a secure copy of the packing slip, bill of lading, a stamped, signed, and dated receiving document, and complete an NIH 2818 form for entry in the NBS. The NIDDK/NIH representative will also complete the NIH 2489-2 to formalize the loan of this equipment.</p>
<p>This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the items listed above and to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541711 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:<br />Company name, address, phone number, primary contact(s), e-mail address, NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large) and DUNS number.<br />All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 10 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 10 pages, should include references. A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than close of business (4:30 pm local time at designated location) on February 17, 2014. Responses by fax or e-mail WILL BE ACCEPTED. This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.<br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires a Contractor to operate and maintain the APF and its animal care and use program. The APF occupies a series of closely located buildings on the Holloman Air Force Base (HAFB). Each of Buildings 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304 can house approximately 72 animals, in 12 dens holding approximately 6 animals each. Thus, the theoretical caging capacity is approximately 288 chimpanzees.</p>
<p>The current primate population at APF is approximately 160 chimpanzees caged in single sex groups. No research will be conducted. All the chimpanzees have been exposed to microorganisms such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or both. These chimpanzees need to be routinely monitored and cared for. Few of the 160 chimpanzees are vasectomized or implanted with Norplant. NO MORE ANIMALS CAN BE BROUGHT ON BASE OR EXCHANGED FOR EXISTING ANIMALS. Any NIH-owned animals taken off the base cannot be returned to the base. The number of chimpanzees is expected to decrease over time as: they are needed elsewhere, they die due to natural causes, or possibly they are retired to sanctuaries.</p>
<p><br />OWNERSHIP ISSUES</p>
<p>The NIH will retain title to the chimpanzees, except if an appropriate transferee who will take title is identified. The animals will then be moved off-base at the expense of the transferee. There is no requirement or expectation for the Contractor to take title to the chimpanzees.</p>
<p>The lifetime costs associated with any removed animal's housing and maintenance becomes the permanent responsibility of the organization (transferee) receiving ownership of the animals. The potential transferee shall obtain permission, after supplying adequate documentation of the proposed use and adequate long-term financial arrangements, from the NIH before removing any animals from the APF. The Contractor shall be responsible for the administrative procedures associated with the transfer, and shipping of the animals.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>All Contractor vehicle drivers shall possess a valid driver's license and must have a safe driving record with no evidence of DWI or DUI. The Contractor shall maintain a certificate of vehicle liability insurance for all Contractor vehicles operated at the APF for the duration of this Contract.</p>
<p>PERSONNEL - The following description is the present estimate of the staff that will be required:</p>
<p>Professional Staff - Director, one additional Veterinarian, and Nurse/OSH Officer</p>
<p>Technical Staff - Program Administrator, Information Technologist, Behaviorist, Clinical Technician, Colony Manager, Secretary</p>
<p>Animal Care Staff - 1-2 supervisory and 13-14 other, including one or more enrichment technicians</p>
<p>Maintenance Staff - 1 supervisory and 4 other</p>
<p><br />CONSULTANTS AND NECROPSY SERVICE - The perceived advantage of having consultants is that they would not have to be retained as full-time employees, and some would not necessarily have to be located in New Mexico. An off-site veterinary pathologist and related services (such as those available from other locations of the Contractor) may be needed to necropsy animals, and process and interpret necropsy tissues. In addition, the Contractor should develop a formal agreement with an Alamogordo or Las Cruces physician who will provide scheduled and emergency consultations and care, related to potential zoonoses acquired from chimpanzees.</p>
<p>ON-SITE TRAINING - New hire training and periodic refresher training for all employees will be needed for employees at all levels. Guidance regarding these issues can be obtained from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), the Guide for the care and Use of Laboratory Animals, American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS), American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM), and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).</p>
<p>ANIMAL CARE - In accordance with the current NIH-held Animal Welfare, APF contractor staff shall receive training comparable to that provided by the Associate Director for Training, Education, and Program-Liaison which will be approved by the Director, Office of Animal Care and Use (OACU), and presented by Contractor personnel at the APF.</p>
<p>MAJOR CHALLENGES - The major challenges at the APF result from the desert climate with its rapidly fluctuating temperatures, and the biosafety considerations for these chimpanzees. A walk-through every 2 hours for temperature monitoring, security reasons, and gross observation of the animals is required. Protective clothing, appropriate showering, proper waste disposal, and other BL2/BL3 biosafety practices are necessary. All the animals have been exposed to microorganisms such as hepatitis C virus(HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus HIV), or both. Not all animals exhibit signs of active infection but all animals should be routinely monitored for infection.</p>
<p>DIET - Standard commercially available chow supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>SANITATION - Hosing of floors 2 times/day, periodic pressure washing of cage surfaces.</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE - Periodic physicals and TB testing for all chimpanzees, serum and DNA and possibly semen banking, blood sampling and shipping for off&shy; site HIV and HCV testing, standard vaccinations and other standard preventative health care for chimpanzees, veterinary care for unexpected health problems and wounding from cage-mates, and rare instances of euthanasia when ordered by a veterinarian considering the best interests of a particular chimpanzee.</p>
<p>PREVENTION OF BREEDING/GROUPING OF CHIMPANZEES - The 160 animals have already been divided into cages containing animals of the same sex, and this shall continue to be the primary method used to prevent breeding. In this case, some shields may need to be placed to prevent inter-cage copulation. However, since non-single housing is a primary need for environmental enrichment, and not all adult male chimpanzees can be co&shy; housed with other male chimpanzees, other allowable methods to prevent breeding can include vasectomy, tubal ligation, Norplant implants, and pregnancy terminations. NIH expects that no conceptions of chimpanzees at the APF will occur, and for surgical terminations to be performed if they do occur. The Air Force will require that any chimpanzee that is born at the APF be removed, probably with its mother, within 30 days of birth.</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT - A behaviorist shall provide environmental enrichment to all 160 animals. A primary need of chimpanzees is to be housed with other conspecifics whenever possible (in the opinion of the Behaviorist). The chimpanzees shall be allowed access to the outdoors when climatically advisable, and be provided indoor shelter when necessary. Buildings 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304 each include 12 cages with indoor and outdoor sections that together hold approximately 6 animals per cage.</p>
<p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY - Animal records shall be maintained on all animals, to include both behavioral and clinical health records. Security procedures such as the use of passwords and backup copies, and LAN system implementation and maintenance shall be performed.</p>
<p>CLINICAL LAB ACCESS - Access to on-site or off-site clinical lab capabilities is necessary to maintain the health of the 160 chimpanzees.</p>
<p>NECROPSY - Approximately 3 to 6% of the APF chimpanzee population may die each year; this rate is likely to increase as the population continues to age. Any instances of animal death or injury must be reported by phone or email to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Director, NIH OACU, within 24 hours. Any such incidents deemed to be significant deficiencies according to PHS Policy will be verbally reported to OLAW and followed-up in writing upon completion of appropriate Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) investigations and implementation of corrective actions. In the case of a death from an unknown cause, a necropsy must be done under BSL2 containment.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE - A variety of logistical methods mixing on-site and off-site capabilities can be used to satisfy administrative requirements. Various types of umbrella liability, employee injury, renter's insurance for damage to the buildings and theft of contents, vehicle insurance, etc. shall be obtained as needed by the Contractor. One definite need is that all costs for operating and maintaining the APF must receive separate accounting from other costs to the Contractor for other sites and tasks. Inspections by the COR and/or Contracting Officer are to be expected, but it is not likely that a NIH representative will usually be located on-site.</p>
<p>USDA, OLAW, AAALAC - Intramural NIH's Animal Welfare Assurance includes the APF, and expects the APF to hold a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) R Registration for the APF, and continue to be subject to courtesy inspections. It is expected that both USDA and AAALAC representatives will periodically visit the APF and issue reports to the Contractor and NIH. Major Alterations and Renovations may be needed to the APF to correct deficiencies that the USDA may categorize as "must be replaced or repaired." The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining estimates for these repairs, and the workscope of the contract and funds for its completion shall be modified as necessary. After discussion with NIH staff members, deficiencies identified during AAALAC site visits will be addressed. The APF will continue to maintain accreditation by AAALAC. In addition, as noted on page 6 of NIH POLICY MANUAL 3040-2 ANIMAL CARE AND USE IN THE INTRAMURAL PROGRAM, please see (http://oacu.od.nih.gov/NIHpolicy/3040-2.pdf), the NIH Director of OACU will review and approve all animal facility renovation plans.</p>
<p>A license from the Drug Enforcement Agency to one or more veterinary staff of the APF for the use of drugs in chimpanzees at the APF will be required.</p>
<p>ACUC - Since Intramural NIH holds the Animal Welfare Assurance, the designees of this subdivision of NIH will manage the ACUC in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director of NCRR (now Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP) and the Deputy Director of Intramural Research. The ACUC will be constituted and meet in New Mexico, and will provide the functions required by OLAW, USDA, and pages 11-13 of NIH Policy Manual 3040-2. Required reports from the ACUC will be described in the Contract document upon award. Members from the Contractor's staff and outside members with appropriate qualifications will be appointed by the Director of the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, to serve on the ACUC. As specified in the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director, NCRR and the Deputy Director of Intramural Research, any instances of animal death or injury must be reported by phone or email to both the COR and the Director, NIH OACU, within 24 hours. Any such incidents deemed to be significant deficiencies according to PHS Policy will be verbally reported to OLAW and followed-up in writing upon completion of appropriate ACUC investigations and implementation of corrective actions.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the selection, certification, assessment, supervision, management, and control of employees. The Contractor shall provide veterinary care and husbandry service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year, including weekends and Government holidays. Contractor staff shall be designated essential employees, and at least a minimal staff shall report for duty every day of the year, including periods of inclement/severe weather or other adverse working conditions. The Contractor shall observe the same holidays as the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall document actual employee hours worked by use of a time sheet, time clock, or other time keeping method, and shall only bill for actual hours worked. Overtime and holiday pay shall be justified. The Contractor shall maintain a flexible work schedule and shall use a cost&shy; effective method of providing essential coverage after normal working hours, on weekends, Government holidays, and other periods of Government closure, and may include staggered or alternative schedules. The Contractor shall organize the workforce in a way that critical functions are performed even when unforeseen absences of personnel occur.</p>
<p>SECURITY - The Contractor shall ensure that an effective security system and procedures are in place at the AFP, and procure and establish these if necessary. The Government is not liable for the loss of personal possessions of the Contractor or its staff. The HAFB has a manned guard booth that restricts vehicular access to the large HAFB. During non&shy;regular business hours, a walk-through of the various APF buildings every 2-4 hours for temperature monitoring, security reasons, and gross observation of the animals is required. Plans for replacing all or some of the walk-throughs by use of video and other electronic surveillance methods shall be approved in advance by the APF ACUC and the COR, and be submitted to the Director, NIH OACU. It is expected that the person performing the walk-through shall carry a cell.</p>
<p>WRITTEN SOPS - SOPs shall be written that cover most aspects of animal care and health, occupational safety and health for the staff, and for reporting and administrative requirements. SOPs relevant to OSH shall be approved by the Nurse/OSH Director, and SOPs relevant to Animal Care shall be approved by the ACUC.</p>
<p>ADVISORY COMMITTEE - The Contractor shall set up an advisory committee of 5-6 members that shall periodically (at least annually) review the APF's operation and serve as an advisory body for programmatic issues. Plans for possible facility modernization and major repairs should be presented to the advisory committee. The COR has the right to refuse the appointment of any named member that the COR believes would be disruptive to the functioning of the committee, or be detrimental to NIH's interests.</p>
<p>OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH)/ ANIMAL EXPOSURE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (AESP) - The plan will be discussed during negotiations and will be incorporated into the contract upon award.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide an effective training program in occupational safety and health. Prior to commencing any work, employees shall be properly trained in safe practices and informed of potential hazards by Contract managers and supervisors. The Contractor shall be responsible for insuring their staff are provided with, understand, and follow those<br />safety instructions.</p>

<p>&bull; Officer may direct by written order.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall establish an Occupational Medical Program and provide employees with appropriate medical care to include pre-employment evaluations, occupational medical surveillance, and job-related emergency treatment.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a pre-placement medical evaluation to determine if the applicant is currently medically and physically able to fulfill the requirements of the position without risk of injury or illness to themselves, other individuals or the animals; provide the applicant with position-related health and safety information; and provide the applicant with appropriate immunizations to reduce the risk of a work&shy; related infection. The pre-placement medical evaluation shall include: i) Occupational medical history, ii) Safety and health counseling, iii)Pre-employment drug screen, iv) Tetanus screening (immunization within last 10 years), v) Baseline audiogram for employees exposed to elevated noise levels, vi) Pulmonary function for employees required to wear full face respirators, vii) Other appropriate immunizations and screenings determined by the species (chimpanzees) and potential hazards (HIV, HBV, HCV, and possibly HAV) that the contract employee will be exposed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall establish an Occupational Medical Surveillance Program. Employees shall be required to participate in this program if they are involved in the direct care of animals or their living quarters, or have direct contact with live or dead animals, their viable tissues, body fluids or waste. The Contractor's Occupational Medical Surveillance Program shall be organized so that the level of surveillance is appropriate for the species and potential hazard that the contract employee will be exposed to, e.g., i) Chimpanzees, ii) Chimpanzee tissues.</p>
<p>Routine collection and storage of serum for Contractor employees is not required after a baseline collection.

<p>PREEMPLOYMENT PHYSICAL EXAMS, HEALTH SCREENING, and VACCINATIONS for hepatitis B, measles, vaccinia, mumps, and rubella are needed, as appropriate for each individual employee. Contractor personnel entering the HAFB shall comply with all relevant HAFB Health and Safety requirements. Persons having active tuberculosis shall be excluded from work with contract chimpanzees. All appropriate personnel shall be immunized against hepatitis A and C, HIV, and other relevant diseases as safe and effective vaccines become available.</p>
<p>CONTINUED HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND A SERUM BANK - A schedule for periodic blood banking, TB testing and revaccination of employees with chimpanzee contact shall be followed.</p>
<p>EMERGENCY CARE plans on a 24/7 basis shall be maintained and provided to all employees.</p>
<p>PREEMPLOYMENT AND CONTINUED TRAINING REGARDING OSH for microbiological biosafety and prevention of chimpanzee-related injuries is necessary.</p>
<p>WASTES - At present, urine and feces from the chimpanzees are treated at the same sewage treatment plant that receives potentially HIV and HCV&shy; contaminated-human sewage. Sharps such as hypodermic needles, soiled personnel protective equipment, and animal tissues that are potentially biohazardous must be appropriately treated and disposed, probably through an appropriate commercial company such as Stericycle of El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>MAINTENANCE - Maintenance and minor repairs to the interior and exterior and for general maintenance of the APF shall be performed.</p>
<p>MODERNIZATION - The Contractor shall develop a proactive method by which necessary major repairs are identified, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner. The methods for this are expected to vary depending on the scope and severity and expense of the repair.</p>
<p>USDA INSPECTIONS - The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the APF complies with standards established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture {USDA) and the Public Health Service (PHS). However, major Alterations and Renovations may be needed to the APF to correct deficiencies that the USDA may categorize as "must be replaced or repaired." The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining estimates for these repairs, and the workscope of the contract and funds for its completion will be modified as necessary. After discussion with NIH staff members, deficiencies identified during AAALAC site visits will be addressed. The APF shall maintain accreditation by AAALAC. As noted on page 6 of NIH Policy Manual 3040-2, the NIH Director OACU will review and approve all animal facility renovation plans.</p>
<p>SHIPPING OF ANIMALS TO OTHER LOCATIONS - If and when a transferee is willing to accept chimpanzees from the APF, and the NIH ChiMP office has approved the transfer in writing, the Contractor shall cooperate with the shipping effort. If the operation of the APF or if the APF animals are transferred to a new contractor, grantee or owner, all medical records shall be transferred to the new contractor/grantee/owner and remain with the animals. It is anticipated that all animals currently residing at the APF facility will die of natural causes or be transferred to other facilities before contract expiration. A list of relevant regulations and considerations for shipping of chimpanzees is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>UTILITIES - As discussed in the Use Permit, the Air Force will provide electricity, gas, water, and disposal of wastewater up to a designated cost per month. Any costs above this designated cost per month will be paid by NIH via the contract, unless the Contractor has been negligent in the use of utilities.</p>
<p>REQUESTS FOR TOURS AND CONGRESSIONAL/MEDIA INTEREST - NIH animal facilities have controlled access and shall not be opened to the public, for a variety of reasons. Requests by outside individuals or groups to visit NIH animal facilities shall be coordinated through the OACU, OIR, the Division of Police, ORS, and the COR. The COR and the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison shall be notified, in writing, of all such requests.</p>
<p><br />MANDATORY CRITERIA</p>
<p>Nonhuman primates can carry a variety of zoonotic agents that can be transmitted to humans and other non-infected animals. For example, some of these infectious agents, such as hepatitis B and C, may have been acquired through previous exposure and may persist in the animal for a significant period of its lifetime. These potential risks increase the importance of identifying infectious hazards for humans working with nonhuman primates. Therefore the offeror must demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>1) Proper experience in the identification, handling, and maintenance of infected chimpanzees. <br />2) Proper experience and knowledge of nonhuman primate infectious agents, including hepatitis B and C agents.</p>
<p>No proposals will be considered without demonstrating these two specifications.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis only. It is not a solicitation announcement or request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of any potential qualified sources and their size classification (HUBZone, 8(a), Small, Small Disadvantaged, Large, etc.). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>The United States Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center is seeking certified sources of dynamic components for the Coast Guard's MH-60T aircraft fleet. Manufacturers of the dynamic components must be certified by Naval Supply Weapons Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS), Philadelphia, PA. The list of components is provided as a separate document.</p>
<p>The following statements apply to all components. The part requires source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain quality of the part. Existing design capability, engineering skills and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) requires acquisition from approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge or technical data that's not economically available to the government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintain quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant government engineering activity. Qualification procedures must be approved by the government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in intended application.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), business size, and any information which will allow the USCG to understand your full capabilities. Any source certified by NAVSUP WSS should provide proof of certification.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a solicitation will be published at www.fbo.gov if the Government intends to proceed with the acquisition. A response to this sources sought announcement is not considered to be an adequate response to any future request for proposal solicitation. All interested parties will have to respond to a request for proposal in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Renee Wood, Contract Specialist, at Renee.L.Wood@uscg.mil, with a subject of HSCG38-14-S-J00005. Responses to this sources sought notice along with any capability statements, company literature, brochures shall be emailed to the Contract Specialist, or mailed to Commanding Officer, Aviation Logistics Center, MRR Product Line Division, Bldg 79, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, ATTN: Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Product Manager, Engineer Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), is seeking information from potential sources to satisfy its requirement for a Modernization Program for the Extended Boom Forklift (EBFL).</p>
<p>The Marine Corps currently has an estimated 800 EBFLs in its fleet. MCSC purchased 530 EBFL's from JLG Industries during the time period of 2001 through 2005. During 2010 and 2011, MCSC purchased an additional 280 EBFL's also from JLG Industries. The Government plans to provide about 800 EBFLs to the selected contractor to utilize in performing the modernization program. The Marine Corps has a requirement to obtain 495 modernized EBFLs and a quantity of replacement parts from the additional EBFLs. All remaining EBFLs and components will become the property of the selected contractor.</p>
<p>As part of the modernization program, the Marine Corps will require that several engineering changes be made to the selected EBFLs. Specifically, the Government has a requirement to ensure that all EBFLs are capable of loading and unloading rotary aircraft with standard and 463L pallets. This requirement necessitates the forklift have a height not to exceed 84 inches. The Government also has a requirement for each EBFL to be able to be configured with a "plug and play", STANAG Level II, armored solution for the EBFL operator cab. No classified information will be provided as part of the RFI. A draft Statement of Work (SOW) and draft Performance Specification are provided to assist in the formation of your response. Note that these are draft documents which are subject to change based on the needs of the Marine Corps. Technical Manuals for the EBFL are available upon request.</p>
<p>Interested vendors will be permitted to schedule a visit to Marine Corps Base (MCB) in Albany, GA to inspect the EBFLs in storage at vendor expense. Coordination of the visit to Albany, GA will be done by MCSC. Interested vendors should contact the MCSC POCs listed below to schedule a site visit at MCB Albany. Once a site visit is scheduled an address and POC in Albany will be provided.</p>
<p>RFI responses must be submitted to MCSC no later than 1400 on March 14, 2014. Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed more than (20) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Reponses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman. Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to stasia.baker@usmc.mil and jarrett.g.faulkner2@usmc.mil. The email subject line should read "Extended Boom Forklift (EBFL) Response to Request for Information M67854-14-I-5011".</p>
<p>Such responses should at a minimum provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Written confirmation of intent to participate in the future procurement for the EBFL.</p>
<p>2. Estimated pricing to perform the five modernization efforts listed at paragraph 3.1.1 and the four services listed in paragraph 3.1.2 of the draft SOW; sufficient detail should be provided to explain the basis for such estimate. Responses shall explain the estimated credit provided to the Government for the additional EBFLs to be retained by the selected contractor. <br /><br />3. Information explaining your capability to perform the EBFL modernization effort; this should include a listing of key teaming partners and subcontractors and their various roles. Also address your capability to perform major system repairs, if required, to obtain the required quantity of 495 modernized EBFLs.</p>
<p>4. Explanation as to your approach for performing the modernization program requirements; include your plan for picking up Government EBFLs and for delivering modernized EBFLs to various Marine Corps installations.</p>
<p>5. Address any significant technical risks with this modernization effort; provide any recommendations for mitigation of such risks.</p>
<p>The Government also plans to schedule an in-person market research session with each prospective offeror to discuss their proposed solution to meeting the EBFL requirements listed in the PS and SOW. This will be an informal fact-finding session. The estimated time frame for these sessions will be the week of March 24, 2014 and will take place aboard MCB Quantico at MCSC. After review of each offerors RFI submission MCSC will contact each vendor to set up a session. This session would also be at the Contractors expense.</p>
<p>This is only a Request for Information. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time. For planning purposes only, the MCSC intends to release a request for proposal for this effort in late 3rd quarter FY 2014. This is only an intent and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The Government will not provide compensation for any expense associated with the response to this inquiry.</p>

RECEIPT OF YOUR REGISTRATION FORM WILL SERVE AS YOUR RSVP FOR THIS EVENT.   <br>  <br> Solicitation Number:  <br> TACTICAL NETWORK CAPABILITY ROADMAP and NIE INDUSTRY SEMINAR <br> Notice Type:  <br> Special Notice  <br> Synopsis:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army will hold a tactical network related Industry Seminar on March 13, 2014 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD. The goal of the event is to keep the industrial base informed of upcoming and long term capability gaps to support the Army's tactical network modernization efforts. After successful fielding of network capability, as part of the Capability Set 13 effort, the Army's focus is to extend similar communications capabilities to additional Brigade Combat Teams, while also making targeted investments for short-, mid- and long-term technology upgrades. These improvements, grounded in Soldier feedback, are aimed at mimicking the simplicity and capacity of commercial networks, while enabling the Army to securely dominate the battlefield across the full spectrum of military operations. During the seminar, Industry will also learn how these efforts will dovetail with the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) process and receive an update on NIE efforts.  <br> The Industry Seminar will, in detail, outline a  quote mark Network Modernization Roadmap quote mark  that synchronizes operational priorities for versatility, mobility and security with technology imperatives and program of record objectives. The roadmap, created by the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications-Tactical with partners such as the Communications and Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, unfolds in three interconnected phases: Network 2.0 (Fiscal Years 2014-15), Simplified Tactical Army Reliable Network (STARNet, FY16-20) and the Network After Next (NaN, 2020 and beyond). The roadmap can inform Industry to focus development efforts and bring forward innovations to fill capability gaps. <br> In challenging fiscal times, the future network will also be a more affordable one. Simplifying the network will lead to cost savings by combining hardware and other infrastructure, increasing competition, reducing software development efforts and decreasing the number of field service representatives (FSRs) required to train Soldiers, troubleshoot systems and sustain the tactical network. After working with numerous stakeholders to define these goals, the Army is now executing disciplined optimization processes to make the Network Modernization Roadmap a reality. <br> Technology Imperatives <br> The Network Modernization Roadmap covers several technology focus areas: Mission Command, Advantaged Services Transport, Basic Services Transport (the radios and smartphones used at lower echelons), Cyber and Network Operations (NetOps) and Physical (power and platform requirements, tactical operations center footprint).  <br>  <br> Industry seminar presentations will review each of these focus areas in detail to include what capability the Army is seeking, how that capability may integrate into the network baseline and Programs of Record and how the Army intends to seek the capability. The day will also discuss R&D focus efforts to support the roadmap and industry partnership opportunities to bring capability forward.  <br>  <br> Lastly, the NIE remains a key operational test bed to support the roadmap. Industry will receive an NIE process update as part of the seminar.  <br>  <br> Questions will be permitted regarding the roadmap and NIE technology focus, methodology and partnership processes. Industry feedback will be welcomed. Several of the roadmap sessions will be technical focused, it is advised that technical staff attend the seminar.  <br>  <br> Following the conclusion of the briefs, bus transportation will be provided back to the parking location.  <br>  <br> REGISTRATION DETAILS:  <br>  <br> The TACTICAL NETWORK CAPABILITY ROADMAP and NIE INDUSTRY SEMINAR <br>  is open to all members of the supply chain, visit requests are not needed for seminar attendance.

<SOLNBR>W911QY14SCDP3
<ARCHDATE>02072015
<CONTACT>Jennifer, 301-619-8401

<a href="mailto:jennifer.s.bassett.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>SYNOPSIS: <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for manufacturing capability for a nerve agent pretreatment. The particular pretreatment of interest is pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg tablets. The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking industry interest to manufacture this pretreatment in a tablet form for use by military Service Members. <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation for proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> Therapeutic pharmaceuticals against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents are required to support the Joint Forces across a range of military operations. As such, the DoD has a need for developing and fielding systems that provide treatment for exposure to CBRN agents. The Medical Countermeasure Systems - Chemical Defense Pharmaceuticals (MCS-CDP) Joint Product Management Office is responsible for the development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment and prophylactic capabilities against chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. The current MCS-CDP portfolio includes nerve agent therapeutics, pretreatments and prophylactics at varying stages of clinical development, including FDA-approved drugs. The DoD currently procures a pretreatment for use prior to exposure to the chemical nerve agent soman, as part of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP). Each tablet contains 30 mg of pyridostigmine bromide, as an orally active cholinesterase inhibitor, and is supplied in sealed blister or strip packaging within a protective sleeve. The annual estimated quantity under the current contract is 36,000 blister packages containing 21 tablets each (or 756,000 tablets) per year. The current manufacturer of this product is Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and the National Stock Number for the SNAPP product is NSN 6505-01-178-7903. SNAPP is supplied through the Directorate of Medical Materiel, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support. The U.S. Army Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) sponsors the SNAPP New Drug Application (NDA), NDA 20,414 approved in February 2003.  It is anticipated that interested parties would become either a contract manufacturer under the OTSG NDA, or could potentially submit their own Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).     <br>  <br> OBJECTIVE: <br>  <br> Currently, MCS-CDP is seeking capabilities from potential sources for production of pyridostigmine bromide, tablets, USP 30 mg.  This efficacy of this life-saving pretreatment is dependent upon the rapid use of the nerve agent antidotes atropine and 2-pralidoxime following exposure to soman.     <br>  <br> System requirements include manufacturing capability to produce pyridostigmine bromide in the doses currently procured by the DoD, to include labeling, packaging and shipping configurations. The storage condition for pyridostigmine bromide tablets, USP, 30 mg, should be identical to SNAPP (i.e., stored at 2-8  C (36-46  F), [Keep from Freezing, Protect from light] or controlled room temperature (20oC-25oC (68oF-77oF)). In addition, the shelf life should eventually be comparable to that obtained for SNAPP (i.e., 10 years at refrigerated temperature or at controlled room temperature for no less than 5 years).   <br>  <br> As such, MCS-CDP is seeking information on current industry capabilities from interested entities in the following areas: <br>  <br> (1) Description of company's technical and regulatory strategy to include: <br> -General background information as well as pertinent development efforts needed to encompass delivery of pyridostigmine bromide in a 30 mg tablet form  <br> -Suitability for use across a wide range of temperature and operationally relevant environmental conditions  <br> -Summary of existing tablet manufacturing capabilities, annual and surge capacity, and place of manufacture.   <br> -Product development, process validation, stability testing, comparative bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, etc.  <br> -Any intellectual property concerns to include your company's rights and ability to sell or license any intellectual property as well as your company's interest in selling or licensing the intellectual property.  Proprietary information should be marked as described in the paragraph below. <br> (2) Description of company's experience with FDA regulatory activities leading to product approval/licensure, to include:   <br> a. Ability to manage activities related to the development of an IND application and New Drug Application (NDA) submissions and supplements. Describe experience with submissions in an electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format <br> b. Engaging in meetings with the FDA and preparation of pre-meeting information packets <br> c.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal plans to award up to an eighteen month, sole source contract extension (consisting of one 12-month extension and one 6-month option period) to current contract number W9113M-07-C-0067 with Atmospheric Technology Services Company, LLC (ATSC), 3100 Monitor Avenue Suite 140, Norman, OK 73072. This extension, to include the option period, is for meteorological support services from 4 May 2014 through 3 November 2015. This extension is to allow time to perform the follow-on competition which will be published on FedBizOpps at a future date.  The options on this extension will only be exercised in the event of further delays with the follow-on competition.  <br> The authority for this sole source award is FAR 6.302-1 (a)(iii)(B) - For DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard,  <br> services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on  <br> contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to  <br> any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  <br> No other known source can provide these services and be in place by the 4 May 2014 required timeframe.  <br>   <br> This effort is to continue the meteorological support services support to the United States  <br> Army Garrison-Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAG-KA/RTS).  The requirement  involves support for both technical operations and base support, which includes (but are not limited to) preparation for and execution of RTS missions through operation of equipment and instrumentation to collect required atmospheric data for mission forecasts and post mission analysis, as well as emergency weather support, aviation and marine support, and community weather forecasts. <br>          <br> This notice of intent is for information purposes only and not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may submit their written qualifications by email only as an MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Josh Flinn, joshua.e.flinn.civ@mail.mil and La Quita Mox, laquita.l.mox.civ@mail.mil.  Statements are due by 4:00pm (CT), 14 February 2014. No phone calls accepted.  The Government will not reimburse for information submitted nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information or materials furnished in response to this notice.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract action upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     <br>

<SUBJECT>99--INVITATION FOR OFFER - FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS
<SOLNBR>L14PS00144
<CONTACT>Samuel Burton
<DESC>Expiration Date:  March 31, 2015
INVITATION FOR OFFER - FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IFO NO. BLM-2014-CHEU-001 April 2014 - March 2015
Introduction The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 6- to 7-year life of this project.
NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport daily or when needed.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs, but BLM will pay demerge charges if BLM facility takes longer than 1 hour to complete  liquids pickup and BLM is at fault for transportation delays.  BLM will not pay demerge charges on delays caused by receiving activity, weather, or any other circumstances outside of BLM's Control.
Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct consisting of such components as Methane, C2-Ethane, C3-Propane, NC4-Normal Butane, IC4-Iso Butane and C5-Natural Gas.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact Samuel R. M. Burton at 806-356-1025.
You must submit a written offer via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on March 21, 2014. We estimate awarding a contract by  March 28, 2014. .  You may call Samuel R. M. Burton by phone at 806-356-1025, or E-Mail at sburton@blm.gov, with questions regarding this IFO.
Offers The Exhibit is the offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred indexprices and total estimated amount per base year and each of four option years, etc.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  
Bidder proposals will be accepted any time up to March 7, 2014, Please contact Samuel R. M. Burton for an offer sheet and fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address:
BLM - Amarillo Field Office 801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500 Amarillo, TX  79101 Attn:  Samuel R. M. Burton
Consideration of Offers BLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.
The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLM's judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions.
Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a partys assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction. 
Term Initial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence April 1, 2014.  The delivery period will be for the term ending March 31, 2015, unless  the BLM cancels the transaction for convenience of the government or for breach of the following contract terms by the offeror.  
The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
(1) The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct; (2) Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or (3) The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM.
The BLM may also unilaterally exercise one or more of four one year option periods by written notice to the offeror.
Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas Liquids The buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site.
No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period.

<SUBJECT>Pediatric Preclinical Testing
<SOLNBR>RFI-NCI-DCTD-2014-0001
<RESPDATE>022814
<CONTACT>Catherine Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Email catherine.kennedy3@nih.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE
<p>The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to ascertain the level of interest and the capabilities within the academic and private sector cancer research communities for participating in the preclinical testing of novel anticancer agents using pediatric models through a testing program supported by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). DCTD is particularly interested in ascertaining the range of available pediatric preclinical models and their suitability for anticancer drug testing as part of a cost-effective, scientifically sound testing program. Respondents are further asked to indicate whether they would be likely to submit a proposal for participation in a DCTD-supported research contract to systematically test anticancer agents using their preclinical models. Based on the response to this RFI, the National Cancer Institute is considering issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) in calendar year 2014.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) initiated testing in 2005 to address some of the challenges associated with developing new therapies for childhood cancers that are distinctive compared to those encountered in developing therapies for adult cancers.</p>
<p>Since 2005 the PPTP has completed in vivo evaluations of more than 70 agents. Approximately 80 single agents and three sets of combinations have been tested against the in vitro cell line panel. To date more than 60 peer-reviewed papers have been published by the PPTP reporting the activity of single agents or drug combinations.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, NCI wants to ensure that the models that it employs for pediatric preclinical testing represent those most suitable to provide predictive testing data for the range of novel anticancer agents that will be available for testing. Two types of contracts are under consideration for a new funding period to support pediatric preclinical testing. One is for individual testing sites that will be responsible for conducting testing for one or more tumor panels, and the second is for a Coordinating Center.</p>
<p>Individual testing sites for in vivo testing will be expected to offer panels of models for testing for one or more childhood cancers. The following are expectations for preclinical models proposed for testing:<br />- Molecular characterization to include gene expression, copy number alteration, and gene sequencing for mutations (e.g., exome sequencing).<br />- For xenograft models, establishment by direct transplantation into immunocompromised mice without in vitro passage.<br />- For all model types, the ability to reproducibly and expeditiously test 6 to 10 agents per year.</p>
<p>The following are examples of the tasks expected of the in vivo testing sites in the anticipated solicitation:<br />1) Propagating and maintaining human tumor lines or genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) in vivo as required to support PPTP testing at their site.<br />2) Receiving, storing, and preparing experimental agents for testing, and then administering test materials to tumor-bearing or non-tumor bearing animals.<br />3) Performing dose-finding toxicity testing as needed prior to initiating efficacy testing.<br />4) Entering parameters of in vivo experiments (e.g., information on test agents, treatment regimens, days of death or sacrifice, body weights and tumor dimensions) in a data format specified by NCI. <br />5) Noting toxic side-effects of the administered material(s) in the rodents and distinguish between tumor-and drug-related deaths.<br />6) Participating in the interpretation of testing results and in writing manuscripts describing PPTP testing results. <br />7) Contributing to the identification of agents for testing based on disease expertise for the histology of the testing panel.<br />8) Participating in regular teleconferences with other testing sites, the Coordinating Center, and NCI. <br />9) Monitoring the genetic stability of the tumor lines and reinitiating xenografts at regular intervals from early passages.<br />10) Collecting blood and tissue samples from treated animals and sending these to the sites designated by NCI.</p>
<p>The following are examples of the tasks expected of the Coordinating Center:<br />1) Receiving, storing, and distributing to testing sites anticancer agents for testing as specified by NCI.<br />2) Coordinating communication with testing sites and with NCI, including via regular teleconferences and through procedures for confidential sharing of documents (e.g., SharePoint site), so that coordinated testing of agents and preparation of reports and manuscripts based on testing results can occur.<br />3) Coordinating the testing schedule across PPTP testing sites for agents specified by the NCI for testing.<br />4) Managing data generated at testing sites, including the central collection of data from testing sites, preparation of data for statistical analysis, and establishment of a database for PPTP data and analyses.<br />5) Providing statistical input in the planning of PPTP studies and performing statistical analysis of in vivo experiments.<br />6) Performing bioinformatic analyses of testing results (e.g., relating testing findings to molecular characteristics of tested cell lines and xenografts). <br />7) Maintaining a public PPTP website that provides information about the PPTP, including documents describing the PPTP models and testing procedures and documents describing PPTP testing results (e.g., posters and presentations). <br />8) Coordinating the monitoring of the quality of all tumor lines and mice, including annual monitoring of the genetic stability of the tumor lines and re-initiation of xenografts and cell lines at regular intervals from early passages.<br />9) Coordinating the collection of blood and tissue samples from treated animals and distributing these to sites designated by the Project Officer. <br />10) Preparing a first draft of study reports using a template provided by NCI.<br />11) Coordinating manuscript preparation and submission of manuscripts describing PPTP testing results.</p>
<p>An in vitro testing component will also be solicited. The cell line panel for in vitro testing should be molecularly characterized in a manner similar to models proposed for in vivo testing. In vitro testing should incorporate data analysis by curve-fitting to the Hill Equation to determine IC50 and Ymin% values, and should also include measures of the relative starting and final cell line numbers.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>In responding to the RFI, research teams with preclinical models that they believe would be suitable for one or more in vivo tumor panels of the PPTP are asked to address the following:<br />- The number of models available and the extent of their molecular characterization, including (but not limited to) gene expression, copy number alteration, and gene sequencing for mutations.<br />- For xenograft models, a description of how the models were established and how they have been passaged. (Note: models established by direct transplantation into immunocompromised mice without in vitro passage are sought).<br />- For GEMMs, a description of the models and of the evidence that they recapitulate the biology and therapeutic responses of the childhood cancer for which they are relevant. <br />- The ability of the models to be used to reproducibly and expeditiously test 6 to 10 agents per year. Experience in using the proposed models for preclinical testing should be briefly described to support the ability to meet this criterion. <br />- Any additional capabilities of the research team that it believes would contribute to meeting the PPTP's testing objectives.</p>
<p>Research teams with preclinical models and testing capabilities that they believe would be suitable for the in vitro testing component of the PPTP are asked to address the following:<br />- The number of childhood cancer cell lines available for in vitro testing and the extent of their molecular characterization, including (but not limited to) gene expression, copy number alteration, and gene sequencing for mutations.<br />- The ability of the cell lines to be used to reproducibly and expeditiously test 10 or more agents per year. Experience in using the proposed models for preclinical testing should be briefly described to support the ability to meet this criterion, including an estimate of the throughput of the team (i.e., number of agents that can be evaluated against the entire cell line panel per unit of time).<br />- The methods to be employed to estimate IC50, Ymin% (minimum T/C%), and the relative starting and final cell numbers. <br />- Any additional capabilities of the research team that it believes would contribute to meeting the PPTP's testing objectives.</p>
<p>For research teams with capabilities suitable for serving as the Coordinating Center of the PPTP, a response indicating potential interest is requested.</p>
<p>HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE</p>

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required supplies. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Natasha.Thieman@noaa.gov. Award will be made using FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition procedures current through FAC 2005-72.<br />

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager Ground Combat Tactical Trainer (PM GCTT) has a requirement to procure 40 additional Student Stations, and provide a software baseline update which will integrate into the current Abrams D/T. The Abrams D/T classroom is part of the Abrams Maintenance Training System (MTS); the other part is the Hands-On Trainer (HOT). <br> The D/T classrooms are currently fielded to Ft. Benning, GA, Ft. Lee, VA, and Gowen Field, ID. The classrooms consist of PC based student stations, an Instructor station and a video distribution system which operates in a closed networked environment. The D/T presents 2D and 3D virtual views of the inside of the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams Tanks and processed through the overhead projector for classroom lessons. The student can navigate within each crew station and interact with tank controls, cables and LRUs in order to perform troubleshooting tasks. The Virtual Reality (VR) tank behaves similar to the real tank in both normal mode and faulted mode. The student can virtually disconnect cables and probe pins with a virtual multi-meter. He can connect the Maintenance Support Device (MSD), run diagnostic routines from the tanks Technical Manuals and activate tank functions as required by the diagnostic routine. <br> The fielded Abrams Tanks have been upgraded with Stabilized Commanders Weapons Station (SCWS) and Embedded Diagnostic (ED) 7.0. The existing trainer classrooms will be retrofitted with the SCWS lessons, ED 7.0 troubleshooting procedures and additional student stations. <br>  <br> CURRENT SYSTEM OVERVIEW: <br> The current Abrams D/T baseline has 65 troubleshooting lessons which diagnose faults in tank systems such as Fire Control System, Hydraulic, Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC), Power Distribution, Fire Suppression, and Stabilization. The D/T software simulates normal tank functions for each of these systems as well as faulted behaviors. It utilizes the MSD with ED 6.0 diagnostic routines to troubleshoot these faults. The ED software is the same software used to troubleshoot the M1A1 tank. Interface software is utilized to insure proper communication between trainer software and tactical ED software. This upgrade must not negatively impact this existing functionality. The D/T also has SCWS virtual models but with limited interactive functions and no SCWS lessons.  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW CAPABILITY: <br> Ft. Benning requires 36 additional D/T student stations that operate in standalone mode with the capability to integrate into the existing networked classroom. Gowen Field requires 4 additional student stations to be integrated into the existing networked classroom with the capability to operate in a standalone mode. The new student stations must be uniquely compatible with the current classrooms, and will require highly specialized knowledge of the existing D/T configuration. <br>  <br> The software baseline upgrade will require development of 10 maintenance lessons for the SCWS and the integration of ED 7.0, which runs on the MSD. SCWS normal behaviors as well as faulted behaviors will need to be developed. The Software upgrade will require highly specialized knowledge of the existing D/T software baseline in order to verify that the existing troubleshooting flows in the current lessons remain valid with the new ED 7.0 software. If the lesson flows are no longer valid, then the lessons must be corrected or new lessons developed. The modified software baseline must run on the new D/Ts as well as the current D/Ts which were purchased in 2009.  This development must be accomplished on a non interference basis with ongoing training of soldiers at the trainer locations.  <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH: <br> The Government intends to award a Delivery Order under PEO STRI Omnibus Contract (STOC II), W900KK-09-D-0728 to CAE.  CAE owns the Software Support Environment (SSE) and the Software Integration Lab (SIL). The SSE contains the software developmental tools and compliers that were utilized to develop the current software baseline. CAE's SIL contains instructor station and student stations with the exact same configuration as the fielded D/T classrooms and is uniquely configured for testing the new baseline. The Government does not own and has no contractual options to purchase these assets.  <br>  <br> This Delivery Order will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark   <br>  <br> ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $1.35M  <br> DELIVERY:  <br> 6 Months after Award for additional D/T <br> 9 Months after Award for SCWS Lessons <br> 12 Months after Award ED 7.0 upgrade <br>  <br> NOTICE:  <br> This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the technical data outlined above.  Interested sources shall submit its capabilities statement (no more than 10 pages) by the closing date of this notice to the POCs listed below. Responses shall provide a description of the source's ability to meet the requirement and delivery schedules.  <br>  <br> CAE can successfully perform this effort since it possesses the highly specialized expertise and unique development tools necessary to meet the performance and delivery schedule required. STOC II contractors are advised that a determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government IAW FAR Part 16. <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  <br> This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement. <br>

<DESC>CLOSING DATE:  19 FEBRUARY 2014 <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (PM CATT), Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PM-GCTT) has a requirement to answer a temporary training need with the Common Driver Trainer (CDT) Stryker Variant (SV) Cab to be permanently located at Fort Carson, CO.  A Fort Lewis Stryker Brigade is being transferred to Fort Carson, CO and has an immediate need to train their soldiers. <br>  <br> Along with this transfer, Fort Carson will be gaining a recent technology refreshed fixed CDT SV system from Fort Lewis.  This requires Fort Carson to prepare a site with the necessary CDT requirements to setup and operate the fixed CDT SV System.  This preparation will take time and will create a training gap for the newly transferred Stryker Brigade.  Currently, Fort Carson has a CDT Mobile Training Facility (MTF) on site with the focus on training the MRAP Variant that was fielded in July 2009.  A solution for the training gap, the inbound Fort Lewis CDT SV Cab can be modified to be able to operate in Fort Carson's MTF.  This solution will not hinder the current training and broadens Fort Carson's CDT MTF training capability.  <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government intends to award a new Delivery Order (DO) under STOC II, W900KK-09-D-0323-0010 with Leidos, formerly known as SAIC.  This Delivery Order will be issued on a Sole Source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality needed because the supplies or services ordered are unique and highly specialized. quote mark  Without this temporary and reversible modification, the Government will not be able to ensure the training capability of this trainer that is being shipped to Fort Carson from Fort Lewis. <br>  Leidos, formerly known as SAIC, was the contractor that produced and delivered both Fort Carson's CDT MTF and Fort Lewis recent CDT SV Technology Refresh.  During the Fort Lewis CDT SV Technology Refresh, the Information Assurance (IA) Operating Systems were updated with the Army's current direction applying the approved Army's Universal Gold Master (AUGM) Operating Systems.  Updating with these new IA Operating Systems no longer allow a recent tech refreshed CDT SV Cab to be a plug-n-play variant cab as per the CDT Product Line Design. Therefore, some minor and reversible modifications need to be applied to give Fort Carson the required training capability.  Leidos is the only company that has the knowledge, prior experience and background to apply these modifications in a short suspense for both the CDT SV Cab and CDT MTF. <br>  <br> QUANTITIES:  This requirement is to apply temporary and reversible modifications to one (1) Fort Lewis CDT SV Cab and the Fort Carson's CDT MTF to allow the necessary training requirements of both CDT SV and MV Cabs.  <br>   <br> ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $25K <br>  <br> PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  6 Months After Contract Award (ACA) <br>  <br> NOTICE:  This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the time required to meet the current need for this effort. Interested sources shall submit its capabilities statement (no more than 10 pages) by the closing date of this notice to the POCs listed below. Responses shall provide a description of the source's ability to meet the requirement and delivery schedules. <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to issue a contract modification to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HPES) under contract N00039-10-D-0010 covering the period from 1 July 2014 through 30 September 2014. This contract modification will also increase the contract ceiling as established in modification P00060 from $5,603,792,250 by $138,000,000 to a new ceiling amount of $5,741,792,250.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.
The incumbent provider, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HPES) is the only responsible source able to satisfy DON requirements at this time.  No alternative source can ensure continuity of service without major disruptions. HPES currently owns and/or controls most of the critical infrastructure and computer software used to provide NMCI services. The DoN has actively worked to remove barriers to competition including purchasing Government Purpose Rights to HPES NMCI Intellectual Property and including options to buy HPES owned hardware and infrastructure. These steps allowed full and open competition for NGEN. HPES is the awardee of NGEN contract N00039-13-D-0013. However, due to a delay in contract award and subsequent protest, the CoSC period of performance is not aligned to the NGEN transition schedule. The aforementioned options will allow the Government to continue NMCI services for those sites which have not yet transitioned. Questions concerning this proposed contract action may be directed to CDR Cody Hodges at 202-433-0334, email: cody.hodges@navy.mil

<DESC>VA69D-14-Q-0273_2; Intent to Sole Source Contract Award
Interim Contract for outside Milwaukee County Wheelchair service
Jessica L. Howard, Contract Specialist, NCO 12 GLAC
12/03/2013

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a 3-month sole source contract award with Transtar Medical Ltd, Campbellsport, WI, to provide Wheelchair transportation for the Clement J. Zablocki VA Hospital under the authority of (1) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2))/ FAR 13.106-1(b).  The 3-month period is necessary to conduct a competitive acquisition for a longer term contract.  

POP: January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2014

Justification:  To provide Wheelchair transportation services for Veteran beneficiaries receiving treatment outside of Milwaukee county as required.  Wheelchair service is critical to Veteran beneficiaries that are physically or medically unable to provide their own transportation between facilities for medical appointments and treatment.  This transportation also provides transportation from VA facilities to the Veteran's residence following appointments and treatment.

NCO 12 is currently in the process of performing market research to determine the best strategy for garnering competition.  The VA will need approximately 3 months to properly compete these services and allow for the successful conversion to a potential new contractor.  

To prevent disruption of the current service, a short-term sole source to the incumbent Transtar Medical Ltd. is required until a long-term contract is put into place, pursuant to acquisition regulations.

<a href="mailto:joseph.l.morse6.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - RTP</a>
<DESC>Synopsis: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground RTP Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), W911NF-14-R-0001, for A Cyber Security Applied Research and Experimentation Partner (AR&EP). <br>  <br> The US Army has a critical need to develop a theoretical and scientific understanding of the cyber domain.  Past basic research approaches aimed at understanding specific cyber phenomena are narrowly focused; studies did not consider the inter-disciplinary nature of cyber systems.  The US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has recently established a Cyber Security Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) that seeks to advance the theoretical foundations of cyber security in the context of Army networks, making fundamental advances in understanding cyber phenomena.  The Cyber CRA couples internal research, analysis, and operations with extramural research and collaborative ventures.  A cooperative agreement was awarded for the joint collaborative efforts of the Cyber CRA to a multi-disciplinary research team, which includes academic and government partners.   <br>  <br> The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to select an Applied Research and Experimentation Partner (AR&EP) for the Cyber CRA.  The goal is for the AR&EP is to bridge the cyber security knowledge gap between Army strategic and tactical cyber domains by developing an innovative applied research and experimentation program that can assess the validity of the CRA basic research while measuring the psychosocial effects on operators.  The AR&EP efforts to enhance the Cyber CRA are expected to be categorized by the following roles/types of efforts:   <br>  <br>  	Role 1:  Research and develop new and innovative approaches and processes to evolve basic (6.1) research results to experimental validation (6.2 applied research), as well as perform experimentation in simulated, realistic, and operationally relevant environments.  Provide experimental validation of the models and theories developed by the CRA 6.1 (basic) research; coordinate in the design and execution of a comprehensive series of innovative experiments; and return experimental results to ARL & CRA researchers, as security classification permits. <br>  <br>  	Role 2:  Perform applied research into innovative approaches to sufficiently represent the complexity of the Army's cyber domain, its dynamics, and cyber security events in testbeds; develop and processes and approaches with the goal of improving the accuracy, impact, realism, repeatability, predictability, and relevance of the experimental processes.  Identify new and innovative means to design experiments.  <br>   <br>  	Role 3:  Join and participate in the Cyber CRA as a Consortium member organization and collaborate with the Cyber CRA researchers on the 6.1 (basic) research.  Actively collaborate with Cyber CRA researchers in documenting the results of Cyber CRA and AR&EP efforts in technical publications, such as journal and conference paper, and reports, at an appropriate classification level.   Develop approaches for the migration of research from the Cyber CRA basic research to the AR&EP experimentation, and the migration of AR&EP experimentation back to the Cyber CRA basic researchers. Ensure an effective feedback loop from the experimental validation while maintaining consideration for the classification of the experimental results and the potentially uncleared status of the majority of the researchers as well as the involvement of foreign nationals. <br>  <br> Please visit http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=2342 for a copy of The Cyber Security Applied Research and Experimentation Partner (AR&EP) BAA and a question and answer page. <br>  <br> As a result of this BAA, the Offeror selected for award will: (1) be awarded a procurement contract (singe indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)) to perform the AR&EP efforts; and (2) be added to the existing CRA cooperative agreement award as a consortium member. <br>  <br> The AR&EP will be selected via a two stage process involving Whitepapers and full proposals.  Full details regarding the application process are found in section I of the Cyber Security Applied Research and Experimentation Partner (AR&EP) BAA.  Planned funding levels for the contract are also set forth in AR&EP BAA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the AR&EP for five years. <br>  <br> An Information Webinar concerning the AR&EP BAA will be held on 18 February 2014.  Details concerning participating in the Webinar can be found in the AR&EP BAA.  Whitepapers for the AR&EP are due 5 March 2014.  Invitations to submit a full proposal will be sent in April 2014.  Proposals will be received (ONLY from invited Offerors) in June 2014, with an award expected in August 2014. <br>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?- ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 10 FEB 1100 ET.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

<DESC>The Forest Service is looking to rent an excavator for stream restoration work in Kyle Canyon, and Lovell Canyon, as well as road repairs on the Griffith Peak Road. The sites are located entirely in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. Kyle Canyon and Griffith Peak are located approximately 45 minutes, and 60 minutes northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, respectively, while Lovell Canyon is located approximately 70 minutes west of Las Vegas, Nevada (west of the town of Mountain Springs, off State Route 160). The excavator will be used to move and place riprap, measured between 36 and 60 inches (diameter), and excavator hard, rocky embankments along the fire-damaged Griffith Peak Road. The terrain the excavator will be used on is rocky, with occasional steep embankments. The Forest Service would like to rent one (1) Excavator, CAT 321, or one with salient characteristics', starting as early as February 14th, 2014. Due to the type of work, the Forest Service will require the excavator to have a thumb attachment to pick up 36 to 60 inch riprap. The Forest Service will also require one single shank ripper attachment, to be swapped out on the excavator as needed, for excavation of hard, rocky embankments. The Forest Service will rent this excavator (or one with salient characteristics') for duration for 1 to 4 weeks (trial period/Base Period) to determine the suitability of this equipment, for use on Forest Service lands. Five days before the end of the trial period, the Forest Service will determine if they will be exercising any of the option line items. The performance period for these rentals could extend up to September 30, 2014. The excavator is to be delivered in Kyle Canyon, off State Route 157, at a destination to be determined later (Assume no more than approximately 17 miles west of US 95 intersection, near the Forest Service Visitor Center). The final pickup location for the excavator will be determined later.

Interested Vendors should submit prices for the work they are interested in performing and for the areas in which they are interested in performing as described in this announcement.
<p>The Contractor will be required to provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, transportation and incidental supplies as required in the Schedule of Items and Specifications of this announcement necessary to perform range fencing and vegetation clearing work. Work will include but is not necessarily limited to barbed wire fence construction (4 strands and 5 strands); removal of old fence line; hand clearing of fence lines; mechanical clearing of vegetation - pond cleaning; mechanical clearing of vegetation - fence line clearing; mechanical clearing of vegetation - brush mowing; mechanical tree treatment - shearing; mechanical tree treatment - shredding; mechanical tree treatment - chainsaw cutting; and liming.

<p>LOCATION:<br />Located within a day's drive of about &frac12; of the nation's population, the Monongahela National Forest is both popular and accessible; yet feels remote and wild.</p>
<p>Considered by the Nature Conservancy to be in an area of global ecological importance, the Monongahela is one of the most biologically diverse national forests. The natural resources of the Forest lead to a wide number of uses ranging from extensive recreational opportunities to timber harvesting; from grazing of livestock to mineral extraction; and from clean drinking water to a place to simply recharge.</p>
<p>Work will occur within the administrative boundaries of the Monongahela National Forest. The Forest occupies more than 919,000 acres in 10 counties in the north central highlands of West Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>It is anticipated that two Blanket Purchase Agreements will be awarded per geographic area. Interested Vendors may receive agreements for more than one area. The Forest consists of the following areas:</strong></p>

<p>NONPERSONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES: This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall provide child and adult psychiatric services at the Blackfeet Service Unit, Browning, Montana; and Heart Butte Clinic, Heart Butte, Montana. This will include, but is not limited to: (1) diagnostic evaluation and treatment recommendations, (2) medication management, (3) case consultation with mental health and medical staff; and (4) coordination of care within the hospital and clinic and with other agencies. Demographically this includes all ages and groups, including pediatric and geriatric patients. MAJOR DUTIES: The contract psychiatrist will work closely with the Behavior Health providers, secretary, pharmacy, and other staff at the facilities to provide accurate, quality and timely patient care. The contract psychiatrist will conduct in-depth interviews and comprehensive examinations of patients that include reviewing past medical history. The psychiatrist will request and/or perform advanced diagnostic tests and examinations deemed necessary to obtain all possible information related to each case. Makes preliminary diagnosis, directs, prescribes or provides relatively new treatment regimens, or arranges for specialized care, or patient referral as required. The contract psychiatrist will base decisions on information obtained, expert professional medical knowledge, and prescribed policies and procedures. Relevant patient-provider interview details or observation notes will be incorporated into clinical records/electronic health record (EHR). The contract psychiatrist must complete required documentation for accurate billing, ordering of diagnostic tests, and medications for every 20 minute patient visit. The medical record must be completed according to hospital policy. The contract psychiatrist will conduct specialty clinics, making observations appropriate to the outpatient's underlying disease and treatment plan, including current symptoms. The contract psychiatrist will review the patient's medications, diet, therapy course, adherence to management plan and patient observations and modify regimen. Instructs and counsels patients and family members as required. The contract psychiatrist will work closely with other medical officers and allied health professionals such as substance abuse counselors, psychologists and other family services staff, et cetera. The contract psychiatrist and Service Unit staff will coordinate overall health care services to meet the patient's medical, psychological and social needs. The contract psychiatrist will refer only those patients requiring specialized inpatient, or other complex treatment, to appropriate contract medical facilities or to other government health care facilities. The contract psychiatrist will have detailed clinical information available for care that cannot be adequately provided at the local IHS facilities. Participates in quality assurance measures, as appropriate, including peer reviews. Plans work, sets priorities, establishes work unit goals and objectives; and plans and establishes work schedules for completion of work. Trains medical students, interns or residents in their specialty or related area of specialization. Assists in the provision of continuing education, on-the-job training, and evaluates medical procedures and processes relative to assurance of quality patient care. As required, performs medically related or patient care assignments that fall outside the designated area of specialization or experience. May serve as patient escort when medically required; usually non-scheduled aircraft or ground transportation. Provides emergency care as required. Required to diagnose and treat non-Indian patients in emergency situations. The contract psychiatrist is subject to Indian Health Service Medical staff by-laws including credentialing and privileging rules and regulations. The contract psychiatrist must comply with all requirements for appointment to, and maintaining status as an active member of, the medical staff. KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED BY THE POSITION: Doctor of Medicine Degree or Doctor of Osteopathy is required. Unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States is required. Board certification by an approved American Specialty board or graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty leading to board eligibility. Ability to work with people from a variety of backgrounds and different cultures. Skill, tact and diplomacy are required while working in stressful situations. Knowledge of medical terminology and coding procedures and ability to input into electronic systems. QUALITY ASSURANCE: The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or Clinical Director (CD) will provide technical oversight through the Quality Assurance Program of the Medical Staff. The contract psychiatrist is recognized as a technical expert in this medical specialty so the work accomplished is considered technically authoritative and almost always, accepted without review. Work will be reviewed for conformance to IHS policies, practices, and procedures; and current professionally accepted medical practices relating to direct patient care. Work that involves extremely complex diagnostic decisions or highly unusual treatment must be discussed with the CMO or CD, who oversee the condition of the patient and all aspects of treatment regimen. The work is evaluated through the Quality Assurance Program, Governing Body and Medical Staff of the Service Unit. Monitoring of contract compliance and appropriate record keeping will be conducted using time and attendance logs, meeting minutes, and peer review chart audits. GUIDELINES: Works within the framework of approved medical and psychiatric practices making judgments in the treatment of patients. In nearly all cases, the contract psychiatrist's expert judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are adhered to, deviated from, or whether new guidelines need to be developed to protect the interests of the patient. Other guidelines available include Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Indian Health Service, Billings Area, Service Unit, and Medical Staff regulations, policies, procedures, and by-laws. In addition, traditional and currently accepted medical practices are available in the form of specialty consultation through other expert physicians, medical journals, and textbooks. COMPLEXITY: The work consists of the broad general practice of medicine, involving diagnoses and treatment of inpatients and outpatients with an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional problems and includes the broad functions of medicine: education, prevention, cure, and rehabilitation, in addition to the practice within the specialty. Assignments are characterized by breadth and intensity of effort and generally involve the simultaneous application of multiple distinct skills, knowledge, and abilities in the care of one or more patients. The work is often difficult and further complicate by the fear and skepticism of patients, redefined or ill-defined problems presented in advanced stages, conflicting data. The contract psychiatrist serves as a consultant on the most difficult cases in the specialty, and performs the most advanced diagnostic and treatment procedures without professional direction. Recognizes rare difficult-to-identify symptoms or signs, and develops a full treatment regimen involving knowledge of new techniques, state of the art methodologies, or the use of prolonged or complicated procedures or advanced, delicate skills. Cases are often critical and require immediate decisions or are complicated because patients fail to respond to previously-tried treatment regimens. SCOPE AND EFFECT: These services directly affect the health and well-being of individual Indian patients, families, and the families of patients, and impacts the health and well-being of the reservation wide community. The contract psychiatrist is recognized as an expert and is consulted by other medical officers, physicians, nurse practitioners and other health professionals within the Billings Area for expert advice and authoritative recommendations. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Personal contacts are with patients, families of patients, other employees, and other medical officers/health professionals within the Billings Area, representatives of other federal, state and tribal health organizations, and administrators and physicians from the private sector. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of the contacts are to exchange information, resolve problems, educate, influence, and motivate individuals and groups to understand and accept recommended medical information, diagnosis, treatment, and therapies. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The work requires some physical exertion and stamina, extensive walking, standing, bending, and similar activities. Patients will be lifted from time to time; however, assistance in doing so is available. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The work is performed in a hospital or clinical setting, with continual exposure to patients having a variety of illnesses and communicable diseases. The contract psychiatrist may be subject to adverse weather and hostile patients and/or their families. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Blackfeet Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the contractor will be required to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). This training must be completed annually by all employees including contractors, volunteers, students, and summer externs. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. Access/clearance to all pertinent computer systems, including completing the Rules of Behavior form, Security training; and a Business Partner Interconnection Security Agreement (BPISA), should be coordinated with the Site Manager or LeAnn Christianson, contract Information System Security Officer (ISSO) in the Office of Information Management (OIM) at the Billings Area Office. LeAnn can be reached at (406) 247-7166 or by e-mail at LeAnn.Christianson@ihs.gov. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR): The COR shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107, with a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name, address and telephone number; (2) Contract Number; (3) Invoice number and date; (4) Cost or price; (5) Dates of Service including the number of days worked; and (6) Remit to address. Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities. The Service Unit will conduct the character and background investigations. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the contract psychiatrist is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards.<br /><br />PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Advanced Informatics LLC, located in Stillwell, Kansas for the renewal of site licenses for 700 residents and 500 students to E*Value software for one year. <br /><br />This equipment will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.  <br />Advanced Informatics is the sole provider of access to their proprietary software E*Value. The software is necessary because the entire university already uses this software to track and evaluate progress of students. For consistency of records, it is imperative that we continue to use the same software that has been in use for at least the past seven  (7) years. Also, the use of this system is based on the premier functionalities that would assist in meeting the ACGME guidelines for the GME/NCC programs. This online evaluation management system will ensure that our Program Directors will be in compliance and meet accreditation requirements as set forth by the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).
<p>Specific ACGME guidelines to which NCC GME programs must adhere include establishing and maintaining 1) a system for scheduling and monitoring resident duty hours in the learning environment in order to mitigate excessive service demands and fatigue, and 2) the ability for programs to collect, maintain and track the thousands of evaluations from the multitude of internal and external didactic rotations trainees as a whole must complete as part of their program curriculum and individually in order to graduate.  For the past 7 years E*Value has been highly effective in providing the means by which the NCC has been able to comply with these requirements.</p>
<p>Since the initial implementation and institution-wide integration of the E*Value system in 2007, roughly 940 faculty, 600 trainees, and 40 administrators have been trained and are relatively proficient in the use of the various E*value modules to perform program management functions such as generating program and institutional management reports, processing evaluations, posting and monitoring duty hours , distributing rotation goals and objectives, scheduling set-up and management, and recording attendance at educational events.  Switching to another system would be extremely costly in terms of retraining system users, including over 1,000 physicians whose main priority is patient care and can thus allocate limited time and resources towards learning a new system.  The NCC has now reached a level of unprecedented system standardization which has greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our ability to manage our GME programs and provide institutional oversight as required by the ACGME.  In addition, E*Value is now the repository for 7 years of historical data that may be arduous and costly, if not impossible to extract in mass.  Lastly E*Value has a proven track record of providing the required services with sound technical support.</p>
<p>Advanced Informatics is the only know source that can provided the requested equipment.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (stephen.enokida@usuhs.edu) by 3:00 p.m. EST on February 18, 2014.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Questions and Answers<br />for<br />Solicitation BBG50-Q-14-V00100410TE, Radio Script Translator</p>
<p>1. When you say translation, what exactly do you mean? The SOW is kind of confusing because some of the requirements, more specifically c), e), g), h), i), j), k) make it seem like the position is that of a bilingual journalist rather than strictly a translator?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> While translation skills are required, any candidate must be a journalist.</p>
<p>2. Is it absolutely necessary that all of the work be carried out at the IBB Voice of American HQ or can some of this be performed remotely?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Some of this work could be performed remotely, but voicing etc. would have to be done here. Journalists can research and even make calls from home, can write scripts from home (assuming they have a computer and internet connection, etc.), but in order to be able to voice stories with studio quality audio, would need to be here (unless they have a studio at home). Work must be evaluated, so must be submitted to an editor at least 1 hour before air time. Feedback from the editor is more reliably delivered in person, rather than email, due to the need to rapidly adjust the work before deadline.</p>
<p>3. Can a contractor bid for certain pieces of the work and leave the other pieces to another contractors?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The person in this position works on particular assignments that are integrated with others' work to form finished products. The assignments could vary from day to day. I mean, the basic work is consistent-research, making calls, writing scripts-but the topics and what show the work is integrated with varies from day to day.</p>
<p>4. If yes on the previous question, what kind of volume would you anticipate for the revisions (length of scripts etc.). How long would the stories where the voice overs occur be?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Scripts range from 45 seconds to several minutes, depending on the show requirements. However, generally speaking, the "output" expected from this person each day would be several minutes' contribution to one or more shows.</p>
<p>5. Are these follow-on requirements? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract numbers? If not, are these new requirements?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a new requirement.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?- ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 10 FEB 1100 ET. PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time. <BR> <BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 04 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 6.5" PIN STANDARD FEMALE CLEVIS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. <p> The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following questions and answers for additional clarification: <p> Question = Q Answer = A <p> Q1:   The note indicates the female thread for a 6.5 diameter clevis should be 6  8 UN-2B thru. Should the female thread meet those dimensions?. A1:   Yes, the 6-8 thread is correct for the 6.5 pin clevis.	Dimensions on the drawing are correct. <p> Q2:  Will the cylinder rod and clevis connect to each other ? A2:  Response - There is a 750K load cell between the cylinder rod and clevis, and also a 7 to 6 thread adapter between the load cell and clevis. <p> Q3:  The 0.380" Radius (two places), a larger Radius is more desirable from a machining stand point, as well as strengthening the part too. Is there any possibility of opening up these two Radii to 0.500" or larger? A3:  No <p> Q4:   Is an extension on the Response Date possible? Extra time will ensure vendors give NASA the best possible bid. A4:  Yes  the response date has been extended from 2-10 to 2-12 (2 day extension) <p> Q5:   Are progress payments possible ? A5:   Acceptance of the clevises requires NASA proof test and inspection, thus deliverables will have to pass inspections prior to payment.  Progress payments are not possible. <p> Q6:  The Solicitation heading identifies the item as a 6.5 pin standard female clevis. Please clarify ? A6:  The procurement is not for pins, it is for clevises.  The clevis receives a 6.5 pin.  NASA is procuring the pin separately. <p> Q7:  The documents deals with these pins as commercial items.  No packaging or shipping instructions other that FOB destination to 35812 are apparent.	Clause 52.247-34 is included by reference 52.247-34, however no other  packaging requirements are listed.  The IAW commercial pack std. ASTM-D-3951-10 states that  anything over 300 pounds  has to be in a crate. How many items can we put in a crate?  In some places it references either/or.  Can items be bulk packaged ?  Is there a maximum weight? A7:.  We generally receive clevises banded onto pallets.    Each 6.5 clevises will weigh a few hundred pounds, so maybe 4-6 per pallet.	They need to be kept out of the weather during shipping. <p> Q8: Does MSFC have a NSN number for this item ? A8:. There is no NSN, they are not off-the-shelf parts.  They need to be fabricated per the provided drawing. <p> The due date for receipt of offers is extended to February 12, 2014. <p> Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on [ENTER DATE]. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

Description of Requirement
The US EPA Western Ecology Division (WED) Laboratory main site has a 150 kilowatt (kW) generator which failed during a load test.

The generator supports partial loads for several buildings through emergency panels.

The trees are on private lands, therefore an easement must be secured from the property owners to allow the government to enter the property to remove trees and to maintain future tree growth to a level 10' below the glide path zone. In addition to tree control, there are seven other specific property rights to be acquired under the 50:1 Glide Slope easement estate.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<a href="mailto:steven.t.helm.mil@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify interested sources for Shaped Demolition Charges.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, to determine interest in a planned Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 procurement for the 15 lb and 40 lb Shaped Charges.  The U.S. Government (USG) anticipates a total contract length of 3-5 years.   <br>    <br>  Item Description:  <br>    <br>  Shaped Demolition Charge's primary use is for boring holes in earth, metal, masonry, concrete, and paved and unpaved roads.  When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted to a compressed gas.  The gas exerts pressure in the form of a shockwave.  The main charge converts the shaped liner into a high speed jet charge, which penetrates the target. The M2A4, 15 lb Shaped Charge penetrates reinforced concrete to a depth of about 3 feet, with the diameter of a hole tapering from about 2.75 in at the mouth. The M3A1, 40 lb Shaped Charge penetrates reinforced concrete to a depth of about 5 feet, with the diameter of a hole tapering from 3.5 inches at the mouth.  <br>    <br>  M2A4, 15 lb Shaped Demolition Charge (NSN: 1375-01-023-7994)   <br>  The M2A1 consists of 10 lb minimum Composition B, which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 48 gram Composition A-3 booster charge.  The explosive charge is enclosed in a molded fiberglass container with a glass cone liner and a tin plated steel closing cap. The shaped charge assembly also has a carrying strap made of cotton webbing and a detachable molded fiberglass 6 inches standoff. Each charge with the standoff is packed in a fiberboard box with foam cushions. Then the fiberboard box is put in a barrier bag.  4 charges are packed in a wooden box per drawing 9281170.   <br>    <br>  M3A1, 40 lb Shaped Demolition Charge (NSN: 1375-00-088-6691)   <br>  The M3A1 consists of approximately 30.5   1.5 pounds of Composition B, which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 48 gram Composition A-3 booster charge. The explosive charge is enclosed in a seam welded or drawn sheet steel container along with a formed 10 quote mark  diameter steel conical shaped charge liner.  The liner is assembled using a crimp in conjunction with an adhesive/sealant.  Brackets for which to affix the cotton webbing carrying strap are spot welded to the container.  A drawn brass detonator well is soldered to a tin-coated steel closing cap which is press fit into the container after loading. The shaped charge assembly includes a detachable welded three-legged steel stand.  Finished assemblies are covered in a barrier material and packed in wooden boxes per drawing 7549165.    <br>    <br>  The Composition B and A-3 will be provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM). The USG is currently conducting Insensitive Munitions (IM) programs for these items. The IM explosives (IMX-104 main fill and PAX 46 booster) may be implemented into production during this planned contract; completion of the IM qualification efforts for the 40 lb shaped charged is scheduled in December 2015 and for the 15 lb shaped charge is scheduled in April 2019.  The USG has not yet determined whether the IM explosives would be provided as GFM.    <br>    <br>  The manufacture of these shape charges requires special skills and facilities. Melt pour loading of high explosives is a critical technology.  Critical skills include laboratory personnel, explosive operators, quality assurance, environmental, and research and development. Critical facilities include temperature controlled cooling bays, melt pour systems, real time x-rays/x-ray technicians. X-rays are important to determine whether the melt-pour casting contains cracks, voids, porosity, or separation.  Defects can cause malfunctioning of the charge.   <br>    <br>  The Contractor will be required to successfully conduct First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on these items.  The shaped charges are procured to USG Technical Data Packages (TDP).  The entire USG TDPs will not be provided in support of this market research; however top-level drawings and packaging drawings identified below are available for interested sources to review.  The drawings are Distribution Statement A, which means distribution is authorized for public release; distribution is unlimited.  Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level and packaging drawings must submit a written request to the POC identified below.   <br>    <br>  Drawings to be provided:  <br>  Item			Top Drawing			Packaging Drawing  <br>  M2A4			8861565			 9281170  <br>  M3A1			8858390			 7549165  <br>    <br>  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal would solicit for the following anticipated requirements, with a resultant Contract award for USG FY 15 requirements as a base quantity, and options included for USG FYs 16-19 anticipated and possible unplanned requirements.  USG currently anticipated requirements for USG FYs 15-19 are as follows by each:  <br>    <br>   FY		40 lb shaped charge		15lb shaped charge  <br>  USG FY15:  	2,412 					116   <br>    <br>  USG FY16:  	2,840 					115  <br>    <br>  USG FY17:  	2,734 					0  <br>    <br>  USG FY18:  	2,638 					109  <br>    <br>  USG FY19:  	2,643 					107  <br>    <br>  Responses:  <br>  Interested companies are invited to indicate their interest by providing the USG the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past relevant manufacturing experience).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR COMPETITION
LIMITED TO ELIGIBLE: 
(1) SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES [8(a)] 
CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, 
(2) SERVICE-DISABLED, VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES AND, 
(3) OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES; 
LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA


LOCATION OF PROJECTS: Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Miscellaneous construction services are required, throughout the term of the contract, for alteration, extension, conversion, and/or modernization of existing facilities, as well as new construction. These services will be required for commercial, industrial, and utility type of facilities located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required for all work as described in the applicable contract documents.

Multiple contract awards are contemplated, in each of the trades; general, electrical and mechanical.  Each contract will be for a 1-year base period, with three 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Task orders will be placed against the contracts to fund projects throughout the year.  

Requirements under these contracts can range from $1,000-$750,000 each.  It is estimated that $8.5 million in task orders will be issued in four (4) years under the general construction multiple award contracts, $8.5 million under electrical construction contracts, with $3 million in mechanical construction task orders over four years.  

Request for proposals and award of task orders will be specific to projects in excess of $50,000 [Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1] and less than $50,000 [CLIN 2].  

Requests for proposals for projects estimated to be greater than $50,000 will be issued to all contract holders for that construction trade, and will be accompanied by detailed specifications and construction drawings.  It is anticipated that award of task orders will be based on price, quality and timeliness.

Expedited competitive procedures; e.g., rapid turn-around times (TAT)/completion dates, generally under 15 days, will be detailed in the contracts for projects estimated to be less than $50,000.  In addition, it is anticipated that projects estimated to be less than $10,000 could be awarded by a designated Ordering Official on a more informal basis.  Approximately 150 work orders were issued in 2013 for general, electrical and mechanical construction projects under $50,000 each for an estimated total of $400,000 for the year.  Average cost of work orders under $50,000 averaged $3,300.

The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals for requirements below the $50,000.00 threshold under CLIN 2 and requirements above the $50,000 threshold under CLIN 1, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government

Contractors will be allowed to submit proposals for both CLINs 1 and 2 (both less than and greater than $50,000), or only CLIN 2 (less than $50,000).  Contractors can receive a contract for both CLINs, for CLIN 1 only or for CLIN 2 only or none at all.

Due to the need for fast turn-around times for meetings, completion of projects, etc., contractors must have a primary location within the state of Oklahoma.

<p>Theses units shall be built to meet FEMA's performance specifications which are based on 24 CFR 3280 (MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS).  The contract(s) will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  FEMA intends to order a minimum quantity of 20 units.  The production level for this requirement is set at two different levels to enhance the opportunity for other than the Full and Open prospective offerors.  Contractors shall have the ability to ramp up production to a total of 150 units per week (Full and Open), 60 units per week (other than Full and Open) within 4 weeks of notice. The period of performance is (1) Base Year with (4) 12 Month options. The NAICS Code applicable to this solicitation is 321991.  This requirement will be solicited as a full and open competition using FAR Part 15 procedures, however since the MHUs are "Commercial Items" some FAR part 12 clauses have been incorporated also.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the contractor's facility, but contractor must have the capability to deliver to any state in the U.S.</p>
<p>Performance Requirements:</p>
<p>After award of the initial IDIQ contract, FEMA will issue task orders to acquire the number of units needed per terms and conditions of the contract.

On January 08, 2014 FEMA posted a synopsis that Final RFP for MHUs will be posted on February 03, 2014.  However FEMA decided for efficiency purpose to post this as a "Draft RFP."  FEMA contemplates that this RFP will remain posted for ninety (90) days.  First thirty (30) days will be as "Draft Solicitation," and the remaining sixty (60) days as the "Final Solicitation."
<p>By doing so FEMA will accomplish the following:</p>
<p>1.  Will allow the industry ample time to proceed in obtaining necessary permits and licenses, etc from any other government entities.  These licenses and permits shall be submitted with the proposals.</p>
<p>2.   To solicit the industry feedback, input and comments on how to better enhance this solicitation, requirement, and if needed evaluation criteria in order to provide very clear and realistic final RFP which will encourage more participation.</p>
<p>This Draft Solicitation and its attachments are as complete as it possibly can be, but may be improved further with input from the industry.</p>
<p><strong>FEMA will only respond comments that are sent to the Agency using the comment matrix provided in Attachment 15.</strong></p>
<strong>Proposals are not requested at this time.</strong> Proposals shall be submitted in response to actual solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP)) in strict compliance with the instructions to be provided in the solicitation. However, prior to the release of the RFP, interested parties may contact FEMA regarding their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information on Commercial Sources for Solar Wind Data and Hosted Payloads
<SOLNBR>RFISolarWind
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>032814
<CONTACT>Joseph Feibel, Phone 301-628-1349 , Email joseph.feibel@noaa.gov - Patricia Mulligan, Email patricia.mulligan@noaa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information on Commercial Sources for Solar Wind Data And Hosted Payloads
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>NOAA has received input from multiple Requests for Information (RFIs) on the subject of solar wind and and CME Imagery since 2003 indicating that there is a cost effective market capability and willingness to supply these observations through data sales and hosted payload opportunities. We wish to receive updated information on the market's capabilities and pricing data for these purposes.  We are also interested in receiving information from technology suppliers supporting such services (see Section IV below). In accordance with the 2010 National Space Policy and NOAA's longstanding policy and practice of making NOAA environmental satellite data available on a full and open basis, it is further anticipated that all data, either purchased under a commercial contract, or received from government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor flown on a commercial platform, will be freely available to the public.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Geomagnetic storms are the type of space weather that causes the costliest and most widespread economic damage.  NOAA issues a geomagnetic storm alert based on in-situ solar wind measurements gathered from a platform on the sun-earth line.  NOAA currently uses data from the NASA&lsquo;s ACE satellite for this purpose, and will begin to use data from the DSCOVR mission in 2015.  Current satellite propulsion restricts those platforms to the L1 orbit giving approximately 15-60 minutes alert time.  We also issue storm condition watches of up to 3 days in advance based on the information from coronal mass ejection (CME) imagery acquired from NASA satellites, SOHO and STEREO.  We are planning for replacement of all these data streams in 2020, in a DSCOVR Follow On mission, and are seeking information on commercial options. Cost effective solutions are a primary concern.</p>
<p>I.	NOAA BASE SERVICES</p>
<p>All observations must be delivered with reliability sufficient to support forecasting requirements continuously and in real time (see Appendices A &amp; B).</p>
<p>1.	Solar wind data purchase: measurements must be made within 650,000 km of the sun-earth line at a distance of no further from the Sun than .99 AU (Sun-Earth L1).   Solar wind measurements made at duty stations closer to the sun than L1are desirable as they would be have a significant forecast advantage, but must meet reliability requirements.  We desire pricing information for purchasing data that meets these requirements which are more fully described in Appendix A.   We require both calibrated and uncalibrated data, and documentation of the calibration algorithms. Duration of service for the data purchase is 5-10 years.</p>
<p>2.	Hosted Payload Opportunity for Coronagraph:  NOAA is also interested in a hosted payload opportunity on the solar wind platform(s) for a GFE coronagraph(s), whose specifications are described in Appendix B.</p>
<p>DATA RECEPTION/GROUND SYSTEM</p>
<p>NOAA has a requirement to distribute its space weather forecast products within 5 minutes of the observation being acquired.  No ground data reception system has yet been designated for a DSCOVR F/O mission.  The DSCOVR and ACE missions use the Real Time Solar Wind Network (RTSWnet), an international collaboration including NOAA antennas at Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, Alaska for downlink.  There is no cost to NOAA for the participation of our international partners.  Responders may assume for planning purposes that the RTSWnet is functional for a DSCOVR F/O.  They are also free to suggest any other data delivery system they feel would be advantageous to the government.  (See also Optional Services)</p>
<p>RELIABILITY OF SERVICE</p>
<p>Solar wind data and CME imagery are delivered to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, CO for use in critical space weather forecasts.  Solar wind data must be received at SWPC continuously within 5 minutes of observation.  CME imagery must be received within 15 minutes of observation. We are particularly interested in a detailed description of the architectural approach offerers would propose to achieve the government's need for reliability of service through commercial service.</p>
<p>USE OF ADVANCED PROPULSION</p>
<p>At the time of the release of this RFI there will not yet have been a demonstration of solar sail technology with sufficient navigational control to maintain artificial Lagrange orbits (ALOs) which would allow longer lead time for geomagnetic storm warnings or to hold positions out of the ecliptic.  However we are aware that such capability is likely to be demonstrated within the next two years.  Therefore the architectural solution space using solar sails is neither encouraged nor precluded in this Request.  If proposed service would employ solar sail technology, responders should take great care with their description of how they would ensure reliability of service.</p>
<p>II.	NOAA OPTIONAL SERVICES</p>
<p>NOAA is not committed to using the services described herein, but requests cost information on these potential services for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Data relay - NOAA does not yet have final plans for the ground system for a solar wind mission in the 2020 timeframe.  We currently use the RTSWnet. (See Appendix C)  If solar sail technology is sufficiently demonstrated in the 2020 timeframe we would be interested in the price of relaying our solar wind and CME imagery data through a satellite elevated out of the ecliptic at elevations between 23- 35 degrees to one or more of those stations.  (See also Additional Federal Agencies' Potential Interests)  Responders are free to address this option service as a supplemental operational demonstration that would not have to meet the reliability standard of operational service.</p>
<p>III.	ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AGENCIES' POTENTIAL INTERESTS</p>
<p>This RFI is released for the purpose of gathering estimated pricing information on cost-effective new services for NOAA requirements.  Responders may also wish to consider whether any of the NSF communication services requirements could be met using the architecture developed for NOAA's requirements and to provide pricing information for such services.</p>
<p>National Science Foundation (NSF)Antarctic Communications:  NSF has a requirement for communications from its Antarctic stations, including Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station located at the geographic South Pole.  NSF issued an RFI (2011) to industry for recommendations to address the unique challenges associated with providing high bit rate communications for South Pole Station, with particular interest on the exfiltration of large daily data volumes from South Pole Station to CONUS.  Not considered in the industry responses was the use of atypical space geometries. NSF is interested in the technical and economic feasibility for leveraging libration point orbits of interest to NOAA as opportunities for data relay services.  Data exfiltration requirements may be found in the requirements specifications associated with the 2011 RFI, located in the FedBizOpps archive at this web address:  https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DACS/DACS/NSF_SATCOM_RFI_2011/listing.html (see Attachment 1, United States Antarctic Program Communications Mission Needs Assessment, pp. 1-10).  NSF is interested in receiving information regarding commercial end-end data relay services, where NSF provides the South Pole earth station infrastructure and operations, as well as NSF terrestrial data network interconnection with a downlink reception station(s). South Pole Station uplink earth station sizing and downlink reception location are open parameters that should be included in the feasibility determination.  NSF intends to utilize this information for continuing alternatives analysis with current solution sets that use various combinations of legacy inclined operation geosynchronous satellites.<br />Finally, responders should be aware that copies of the hardware satisfying NOAA requirements could also satisfy certain requirements for NASA's Heliophysics and Near Earth Object Programs.  There is no schedule yet for these possible future procurements, information about the potential market is supplied for your consideration in business planning.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS BEING ISSUED TO CHANGE THE SOLICITATION NUMBER TO REFLECT N00174-14-R-0005. SOLICITAITON WAS RELEASED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON 03 FEBRUARY 2014...<br /><br /><br /><br />NSWC Indian Head requires contractor support in performing the functions of an Alteration Installation Team (AIT) with the installation of Ship Alterations (S/A), Ship Change Documents (SCDs), and Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTS) as related to the Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) on U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard Vessels. Contractor work shall be completed according to contract, and shall take place at varying locations and facilities including: private and public shipyards, pier side, in dry dock, CONUS, OCONUS, or at the contractor's facility. Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award. It will consist of one base year plus two option years. Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate. This requirement is considered full and open. The NAICS code is 541990. The Size Standard is $14M. The FSC code is 1230. This synopsis is for non-commercial services. The attached Data Requirements List and applicable instructions are included with this announcement. The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-13-R-0044, and will be issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Proposals will be requested with the release of the solicitation.<br /><br />The Contractor's support shall be in accordance with specific, individually written task orders issued by NSWC IHD within the general scope of the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, facilities and equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost. These factors are of equal importance. All non-priced factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost in importance. However, Cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQ's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.<br /><br />Copies of solicitation N00174-13-R-0044 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person. These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED. This synopsis is being posted to both Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Sea Systems Command. NOTE: Offerors are ineligible for award unless registered in DOD's Central Contractor Registration Database which has now been integrated with the System for Award Management (SAM). Information regarding registration and annual confirmation requirements is available at 1-866-606-8220 and http://www.sam.gov.<br /><br />Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS). <br /><br />The deadline to respond to this synopsis is 04 September 2013. <br /><br />The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of this solicitation.

<a href="mailto:latova.j.greene@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Closing Date:  2/18/2014 <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:   <br>  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager Ground Combat Tactical Trainer (PM GCTT) has a requirement to procure 40 additional Student Stations, and provide a software baseline update which will integrate into the current Abrams D/T. The Abrams D/T classroom is part of the Abrams Maintenance Training System (MTS); the other part is the Hands-On Trainer (HOT).  <br>  The D/T classrooms are currently fielded to Ft. Benning, GA, Ft. Lee, VA, and Gowen Field, ID. The classrooms consist of PC based student stations, an Instructor station and a video distribution system which operates in a closed networked environment. The D/T presents 2D and 3D virtual views of the inside of the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams Tanks and processed through the overhead projector for classroom lessons. The student can navigate within each crew station and interact with tank controls, cables and LRUs in order to perform troubleshooting tasks. The Virtual Reality (VR) tank behaves similar to the real tank in both normal mode and faulted mode. The student can virtually disconnect cables and probe pins with a virtual multi-meter. He can connect the Maintenance Support Device (MSD), run diagnostic routines from the tanks Technical Manuals and activate tank functions as required by the diagnostic routine.  <br>  The fielded Abrams Tanks have been upgraded with Stabilized Commanders Weapons Station (SCWS) and Embedded Diagnostic (ED) 7.0. The existing trainer classrooms will be retrofitted with the SCWS lessons, ED 7.0 troubleshooting procedures and additional student stations.  <br>    <br>  CURRENT SYSTEM OVERVIEW:  <br>  The current Abrams D/T baseline has 65 troubleshooting lessons which diagnose faults in tank systems such as Fire Control System, Hydraulic, Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC), Power Distribution, Fire Suppression, and Stabilization. The D/T software simulates normal tank functions for each of these systems as well as faulted behaviors. It utilizes the MSD with ED 6.0 diagnostic routines to troubleshoot these faults. The ED software is the same software used to troubleshoot the M1A1 tank. Interface software is utilized to insure proper communication between trainer software and tactical ED software. This upgrade must not negatively impact this existing functionality. The D/T also has SCWS virtual models but with limited interactive functions and no SCWS lessons.   <br>    <br>  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW CAPABILITY:  <br>  Ft. Benning requires 36 additional D/T student stations that operate in standalone mode with the capability to integrate into the existing networked classroom. Gowen Field requires 4 additional student stations to be integrated into the existing networked classroom with the capability to operate in a standalone mode. The new student stations must be uniquely compatible with the current classrooms, and will require highly specialized knowledge of the existing D/T configuration.  <br>    <br>  The software baseline upgrade will require development of 10 maintenance lessons for the SCWS and the integration of ED 7.0, which runs on the MSD. SCWS normal behaviors as well as faulted behaviors will need to be developed. The Software upgrade will require highly specialized knowledge of the existing D/T software baseline in order to verify that the existing troubleshooting flows in the current lessons remain valid with the new ED 7.0 software. If the lesson flows are no longer valid, then the lessons must be corrected or new lessons developed. The modified software baseline must run on the new D/Ts as well as the current D/Ts which were purchased in 2009.  This development must be accomplished on a non interference basis with ongoing training of soldiers at the trainer locations.   <br>    <br>  ACQUISITION APPROACH:  <br>  The Government intends to award a Delivery Order under PEO STRI Omnibus Contract (STOC II), W900KK-09-D-0728 to CAE.  CAE owns the Software Support Environment (SSE) and the Software Integration Lab (SIL). The SSE contains the software developmental tools and compliers that were utilized to develop the current software baseline. CAE's SIL contains instructor station and student stations with the exact same configuration as the fielded D/T classrooms and is uniquely configured for testing the new baseline. The Government does not own and has no contractual options to purchase these assets.   <br>    <br>  This Delivery Order will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark    <br>    <br>  ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $1.35M   <br>  DELIVERY:   <br>  6 Months after Award for additional D/T  <br>  9 Months after Award for SCWS Lessons  <br>  12 Months after Award ED 7.0 upgrade  <br>    <br>  NOTICE:   <br>  This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the technical data outlined above.  Interested sources shall submit its capabilities statement (no more than 10 pages) by the closing date of this notice to the POCs listed below. Responses shall provide a description of the source's ability to meet the requirement and delivery schedules.   <br>    <br>  CAE can successfully perform this effort since it possesses the highly specialized expertise and unique development tools necessary to meet the performance and delivery schedule required. STOC II contractors are advised that a determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government IAW FAR Part 16.  <br>    <br>  DISCLAIMER:   <br>  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement.  <br>

<a href="mailto:jessica.jackson3@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>CLOSING DATE:  19 FEBRUARY 2014  <br>    <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (PM CATT), Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PM-GCTT) has a requirement to answer a temporary training need with the Common Driver Trainer (CDT) Stryker Variant (SV) Cab to be permanently located at Fort Carson, CO.  A Fort Lewis Stryker Brigade is being transferred to Fort Carson, CO and has an immediate need to train their soldiers.  <br>    <br> Along with this transfer, Fort Carson will be gaining a recent technology refreshed fixed CDT SV system from Fort Lewis.  This requires Fort Carson to prepare a site with the necessary CDT requirements to setup and operate the fixed CDT SV System.  This preparation will take time and will create a training gap for the newly transferred Stryker Brigade.  Currently, Fort Carson has a CDT Mobile Training Facility (MTF) on site with the focus on training the MRAP Variant that was fielded in July 2009.  A solution for the training gap, the inbound Fort Lewis CDT SV Cab can be modified to be able to operate in Fort Carson's MTF.  This solution will not hinder the current training and broadens Fort Carson's CDT MTF training capability.   <br>    <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government intends to award a new Delivery Order (DO) under STOC II, W900KK-09-D-0323-0010 with Leidos, formerly known as SAIC.  This Delivery Order will be issued on a Sole Source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality needed because the supplies or services ordered are unique and highly specialized. quote mark  Without this temporary and reversible modification, the Government will not be able to ensure the training capability of this trainer that is being shipped to Fort Carson from Fort Lewis.  <br>   <br> Leidos, formerly known as SAIC, was the contractor that produced and delivered both Fort Carson's CDT MTF and Fort Lewis recent CDT SV Technology Refresh.  During the Fort Lewis CDT SV Technology Refresh, the Information Assurance (IA) Operating Systems were updated with the Army's current direction applying the approved Army's Universal Gold Master (AUGM) Operating Systems.  Updating with these new IA Operating Systems no longer allow a recent tech refreshed CDT SV Cab to be a plug-n-play variant cab as per the CDT Product Line Design. Therefore, some minor and reversible modifications need to be applied to give Fort Carson the required training capability.  Leidos is the only company that has the knowledge, prior experience and background to apply these modifications in a short suspense for both the CDT SV Cab and CDT MTF.  <br>    <br> QUANTITIES:  This requirement is to apply temporary and reversible modifications to one (1) Fort Lewis CDT SV Cab and the Fort Carson's CDT MTF to allow the necessary training requirements of both CDT SV and MV Cabs.   <br>     <br> ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $25K  <br>    <br> PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  6 Months After Contract Award (ACA)  <br>    <br> NOTICE:  This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the time required to meet the current need for this effort. Interested sources shall submit its capabilities statement (no more than 10 pages) by the closing date of this notice to the POCs listed below. Responses shall provide a description of the source's ability to meet the requirement and delivery schedules.  <br>    <br> DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement.  <br>

<p>Q1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will the government designed patterns be made available to a contractor for use in garment submission - both for under garments &amp; uniform?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If not, which patterns are most appropriate for use - MCCUU or FROG?</p>
<p>A1. PdM-ICE intends to use a Government-owned design for the tropical combat blouse, trouser, t-shirt and briefs. For these items, respondents are encouraged to submit fabrics suitable for a tropical environment. End item designs will also be considered as an alternative to the Government-owned designs. If an offeror's under-layer or uniform material is selected to be field tested, the garment design will be provided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are the table of performance characteristics in Attachment 1 to the RFI listed in their order of preference/priority?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If not, what is the priority of importance of the desired characteristics?</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This is not a solicitation. USAID does NOT invite offerors to submit proposals in response to this synopsis NOR will USAID accept comments, questions and/or inquiries in response to this synopsis and will NOT respond to any. NO awards are anticipated to be made in response to this synopsis. Prospective offerors are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of the solicitation package is limited to the following electronic medium: FEDBIZOPPS web page (http://www.fbo.gov/).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this synopsis is to outline the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) proposed plans to:</p>
<p>&bull; Procure health commodities and services and promote sustainable supply chains;<br />&bull; Inform and communicate USAID's plans with the public and key external stakeholders, in particular, members of the business community;<br />&bull; Facilitate and encourage advanced planning by partners for consideration of the follow on design; and<br />&bull; To encourage competition.</p>
<p>Background<br />USAID is the USG's principle implementing agency for international development assistance. The Bureau for Global Health, whose vision is to create a world where people lead healthy, productive lives and where mothers and children thrive, has a broad portfolio that includes a wide array of programs and investments that represent the commitment and determination of USG to prevent suffering, save lives, and create an environment that encourages development.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of USAID's health programs is dependent on, among other things, an uninterrupted supply of essential quality health commodities, including pharmaceuticals, in addition to supply chain assistance to health systems that manage these commodities.</p>
<p>Currently, there are multiple offices within the Bureau for Global Health - as well as Presidential Initiatives - that run programs that procure health commodities. These are the Office of Health, Infectious Diseases, and Nutrition (HIDN), the Office of HIV/AIDS (OHA), and the Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH), and both the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). As part of the Bureau's overall strategy, these offices and initiatives support partner countries in preventing and managing major health challenges of poor, underserved and vulnerable people, leading to improved health outcomes by:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing technical leadership to USG programs<br />&bull; Partnering strategically with a wide array of stakeholders that enhance the development process<br />&bull; Accelerating innovation, science and technology in order to facilitate a successful treatment and prevention of disease<br />&bull; Scaling up evidence-based, equitable and locally adapted health solutions<br />&bull; Strengthening local health systems<br />&bull; Promoting gender equality<br />&bull; Working efficiently and being effective stewards of public trust and resources</p>
<p>The Global Health Initiative<br />The U.S. Government's global health portfolio includes a diverse set of programs and investments in approximately 80 countries worldwide. All of the countries in which the USG has health investments are essential partners for achieving and sustaining the ambitious outcomes outlined in the Global Health Initiative (GHI). Equally important to the success of GHI is the strategic coordination and partnerships with USG partner organizations such as the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (S/GAC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources and Service Administration, the Department of Defense and the Peace Corps. The interagency coordination required to support PEPFAR and PMI increases the effectiveness and efficiency of USG health programs globally by using a "whole of government approach."</p>
<p>Supply chain management and the procurement of essential health commodities are an essential component of the Agency's health portfolio and directly support the Agency's health contribution to GHI. For example, ensuring an adequate supply of quality medicines and diagnostic equipment for HIV programs has contributed significantly to PEPFAR's ability to provide care and treatment for 4.5 million persons living with HIV/AIDS. Maintaining an adequate supply of quality essential medicines is critical to achieving President Obama's goal of putting six million people on treatment by the end 2015 - two million more people than the Administration's original goal.</p>
<p>Essential good quality health commodities have played a critical role toward achieving PMI's goal to halve the burden of malaria in 70 percent of at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa (approximately 450 million people). Between 2006 and 2010, PMI procured 95.3 million artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatments, 45.4 million insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and 10.2 million treatments for intermittent preventative treatment for malaria in pregnancy. This has contributed to the reductions in mortality among children under five in most of PMI's focus countries. Ensuring an adequate supply of malaria related commodities will continue to be a key component of PMI's continued efforts to further reduce the burden malaria.</p>
<p>USAID has been a leader in efforts to meet the reproductive health needs of women and couples by increasing access to modern methods of contraception for millions of couples annually. While access to family planning services has improved dramatically since USAID's efforts began in the 1960s, more than 215 million women worldwide who would like to delay or avoid pregnancy still do not have access to family planning information and services. Under GHI, the USG goal is to prevent 54 million unintended pregnancies and increase the modern contraceptive prevalence by up to two percentage points annually on average across assisted countries. The Agency is placing special attention on increasing access to family planning services for the poorest wealth quintiles, where access remains lowest. Because USAID's programs maximize access to voluntary family planning products and services, more couples and individuals in the developing world have been able to determine the spacing of their children and family size. Investments in contraceptive commodity support and strengthening logistics systems have reduced stock outs and increased availability of contraceptives in key countries. Between 2006 and 2010, USAID delivered $376.4 million worth of contraceptives and condoms to public and private sector programs worldwide, while providing supply chain assistance in 33 countries. These efforts have contributed to substantial increases in the percentage of women using modern contraceptives in USAID priority countries and have translated to improved maternal and child health, family well-being, women's empowerment, poverty reduction and elevated development prospects.</p>
<p>Current Health Awards<br />Currently, the Bureau for Global Health has two single award IQCs responsible for the procurement and delivery of essential health commodities and supply chain assistance. The first is the USAID | DELIVER PROJECT that focuses its support largely on the PMI and programs in family planning/reproductive health, maternal and child health, emerging pandemic threats, and other areas. The second is the Supply Chain Management System for HIV/AIDS (SCMS) IQC that supports the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). More information on the current IQCs can be found on www.pfscm.org and www.deliver.jsi.com.</p>
<p>New Award Design</p>
<p>The consolidation of the procurement and assistance elements of the DELIVER and SCMS IQCs into a single award will ensure an uninterrupted supply of essential USAID-donated health commodities, align USAID's health commodity requirements across the priority health elements, reduce costs to the U.S. Government, improve management and accountability and ensure implementation flexibilities to respond to unpredictable global demands for USAID essential health commodities and assistance. In addition to this single award, USAID's Bureau for Global Health anticipates the release of several new awards to provide specialized services that are presently embedded in the DELIVER and SCMS IQCs.</p>
<p>The new architecture will realign activities to achieve the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintaining continuity of operations to ensure no interruption of supplies; <br />&bull; Ensuring technical and program soundness through a collaborative process; <br />&bull; Ensuring flexibility to meet different program (health element) requirements as well as future needs; <br />&bull; Minimizing management burden for the field; <br />&bull; Promoting risk mitigation by collaborative strategies in quantification/forecasting, market dynamics, and freight forwarding/warehousing and delivery;<br />&bull; Incorporating the principles of GHI, USAID Forward and Procurement Reform; and<br />&bull; Maintaining program oversight and accountability by the different health elements as needed to meet disease specific requirements.</p>
<p>All awards will be made on a full and open competitive basis, except the laboratory procurement IQC that is set aside for small business concerns. The architecture for the supply chain follow-on includes the following awards:</p>
<p>A. Single Award IQC for Commodity Procurement and Supply Chain Assistance: This activity will provide a comprehensive array of services for USG health commodity procurement and related supply chain assistance encompassing the different elements of a comprehensive supply chain (e.g. quantification/forecasting, procurement, transportation, warehousing, and information systems). The IQC holder will be expected to manage the full range of supply chain services - from quantification, procurement, and warehousing to delivery of product to the USG-designated client. The successful implementation of these services depends upon the IQC holder's ability to minimize lead time for field programs while maximizing overall value-for-money performance on delivery of quality essential health commodities. The tasks of this IQC are integrally related and implemented through a single award to optimize overall performance and accountability of what, by best practice, should be a continuous, seamless, operational supply chain. The IQC will work with USG country programs to improve country counterpart systems and increase their capacity to more fully conduct this procurement and distribution work on their own. The IQC is anticipated to supply an estimated $7 billion worth of essential health commodities annually at no fee to over 50 countries; and to provide technical assistance to improve the performance and sustainability of country supply chain systems. The duration of the IQC is anticipated to be 5 years with an option for an additional 3 year period.</p>
<p>The IQC contractor is expected to work with the Quality Assurance holder (see D below) to ensure that the quality of products purchased meets USG standards. In addition, the IQC holder will provide a required set of data to the Business Intelligence (BI) contractor (see E below).</p>
<p>B. Small Business Set Aside - Single award IQC for a Procurement Service Agent for Laboratory Supplies and Equipment: The IQC will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of laboratory supplies and equipment to designated destinations/stakeholders for use in host country programs. The duration of this IQC is anticipated to be 5 years with an option for an additional 3 year period.</p>
<p>C. Multiple Awards for Specialized Supply Chain Assistance: These awards are anticipated to be made through annual program statements (APS) to invite and encourage organizations with specialized capabilities. One APS will seek capabilities for research, innovation and evaluation, and access to the state-of-the-art in supply chain management from academia as well as the private, commercial, and other sectors. Another possible APS will be for organizations in the "global south" with demonstrated capabilities in supply chain management, assistance, and/or training, to support local capacity building, and provide for south-to-south assistance and access to regional specializations. Other awards may be made in areas of specialization (e.g., management information system, information technologies) if there is sufficient demand from field.</p>
<p>D. Quality Assurance Award: The Quality Assurance (QA) award will promote the effectiveness and efficiency of USAID QA services by combining and coordinating QA activities across health elements. This activity will provide independent, essential, comprehensive quality assurance/control services covering the different health elements in the Bureau.</p>
<p>E. Business Intelligence Award: The Business Intelligence (BI) award is expected to collect and integrate data from multiple partner systems and generate reports and alerts based on established thresholds. By embedding BI into existing process applications, USAID's control, management, and ownership of information will be enhanced to facilitate information sharing and coordination across health elements within the Bureau's supply chain.</p>
<p>Please note that to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, offerors bidding as primes for award A (Single Award IQC for Commodity Procurement and Supply Chain Assistance) and/or award B (small business set-aside for Laboratory Equipment and Supplies) will not be permitted to bid as primes on award D (Quality Assurance) and vice versa. This is done to ensure the independence of those responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of the products being purchased from those responsible for procurement of product. In addition all awardees are expected to collaborate with one another and will be required to provide non-proprietary data to the Agency using the IT platform developed and maintained by the BI contractor.</p>
<p>USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from this transmission. This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Air Force awarded a J&amp;A approved&nbsp;sole source contract modification to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation to provide an additional three (3) months of DRC Operational Support at DRC supported sites. This modification is an in scope change to an existing contract and it was not prudent to break out this effort and compete it due to the esoteric nature of the DRC program.

<DESC>&nbsp;The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to L-3 Communications, 7640 Omnitech Place Victor, NY 14564-9782 for the purchase the following:
<p><br />Part Number: 1512X-RK-040T/ Hawkeye III Lite X-Band 40W (Quantity: 12)<br />Part Number: 66-4400AXINT/LNB X-Band (Quantity: 4)<br />Part Number: 62-00001T/Converter X-SSPA (Quantity: 4)<br />Part Number: 0135-2101-06T/Feed Boom X (Quantity: 4)</p>
<p>The purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The original VSAT terminal was the AN/USC-68A (produced by Rockwell Collins Satellite Communications Systems Inc). However, this system reached end-of-life and a study was completed in FY 11. The Hawkeye Lite III was selected after extensive evaluation of various systems. <br /><br />The Hawkeye III Lite is part of the entire Rapid Response Kit (RRK) and is integral to its operation. The RRK system has received an Approval to Operate (ATO) from Naval Network Warfare Command and has been certified through interoperability certification. Substituting other network components will invalidate the ATO and will invalidate any interoperability certification. To have equipment that is not accredited and to go through another accreditation process is six months for the accreditation package to be granted an Authority to Operate. This would lead to considerable delays and additional costs in the fielding the Rapid Response capability that is not expected to be recovered through competition. No other known solution has the required accredited ATO, and certification for the DJC2 System. Further, this hardware is only available from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and there are no known resellers or distributors.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Only these items, provided by L-3 have been approved for the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) use.</p>

The current contract Ordering Period, Ordering Period IV, is set to expire on January 31, 2014. At the time of award, it was anticipated that FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which was incorporated into the subject contract, would be invoked, if necessary, to provide continued PSO services for the six-month period ending July 31, 2014. However, the GAO has ruled that FAR 52.217-8 cannot be exercised unless the option prices therein were evaluated at the time of award. Since the option prices were not evaluated at the time of award, FAR 52.217-8 cannot be invoked and this Sole Source Justification is necessary to provide for continued PSO services until at least March 31, 2014, with an option of one-month which, if exercised, would continue services until April 30, 2014. The total amount of this extension, including the option, is estimated at $604,355.30. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
