<DESC>The Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Fire Department, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Physio-Control, Inc., of Redmond, WA, for the purchase of 30 Lifepak 1000 automated external defibrillators (AEDs).
<p>The NIST Fire Department is required to maintain, inspect, and replace, NIST's inventory of AEDs, as well as train the NIST Staff on usage/operation of the device. Currently, there are 45 Physio-Control Lifepak 500 AEDs on site at the Gaithersburg, MD, campus. Thirty of those AEDs are over 15 years old and are no longer being serviced by the manufacturer. Given this fact, the Fire Department must update 30 AEDs. The other 15 AEDs are the new Physio -Control LIFEPAK 1000.</p>
<p>The Government will purchase 30 additional Physio-Control LIFEPAK 1000 units. Brand name justification is based upon all of the following: <br />-The Fire Department stocks batteries, electrodes, and other supplies for these units. The Fire Department can use the electrodes from the old 500 series with the new 1000. The batteries that currently in stock, can also be utilized; and<br />- Keeping the same model of AED keeps the NIST staff already trained in the use of model 1000, up to date to save a life; and<br />-The NIST Fire Department provides emergency services when required by Montgomery County, MD fire and rescue. Physio-Control equipment is used by Montgomery County Emergency Services Teams. NIST must utilize the same equipment to provide the maximum care possible to give the best chance of survival to NIST, staff as well as the surrounding community.</p>
<p>This brand name equipment must be procured on a sole source basis. The basis for sole source is as follows. Only Physio-Control themselves can sell to the Federal Government. While Physio-Control has resellers, the resellers are not permitted to sell to the Federal Government, per the contract between resellers and Physio -Control. Physio-Control is the sole manufacturer and provider of the required equipment.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by September 9, 2018, will be considered by the Government. Any party responding to this notice must provide clear and specific evidence that they are an authorized reseller of the required equipment and have authorization from Physio-Control to sell to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to compete this requirement.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition: <br />FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The offeror's technical proposal shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. Offerors who rate unacceptable in Technical will be removed from further consideration for award. Price will be evaluated to determine reasonableness of the proposed price. Unreasonable offers cannot be selected for award.<br /><br />Technical Proposal. Submit a technical proposal that indicates how your company will perform to the Statement of Work, specifically section 3. There are eight individual areas identified in section 3 of the SOW; paragraphs 3.1 - 3.8. Include the following with your quotation for the purposes of technical evaluation; 1) specification sheets for all major hardware, separately identified for each area, 2 a schedule indicating number of days required to complete the project for each area, and 3) the design approach for each area.</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE: Proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>Past Performance: Please include in your proposal three (3) references for recent and relevant projects similar in scope to this project. Recent projects would include similar projects within the past three years. Relevant projects would include the completion of projects that are similar in scope; A/V system design and equipment installation. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, management and safety of the offeror's past performance. The references do not have to be government contracts. Past Performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis using the following:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or "neutral") past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, a neutral rating shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-100 effective August 22, 2018.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The Small Business Administration has not issued a class waiver of the non-manufacturer rule for this NAICS code. Therefore, the non-manufacturer rule applies to this procurement. The required equipment is manufactured by 3M Scott. 3M Scott is headquartered in Monroe, NC, and employs more than 1,100 people worldwide. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized. Use of full and open competition is appropriate based upon the application of the non-manufacturer rule to the procurement. Given that this is a brand name only requirement, quoters could not meet the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule and provide the equipment required by the solicitation.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Fire Department is tasked to respond to all types of emergencies. This requires the firefighters to carry their own breathing air on themselves. This is accomplished by carrying the SCOTT Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, (SCBA). The Government has a requirement for 12 Self Contained Breathing Apparatus Systems, manufactured by 3M Scott.</p>
<p>This is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement. Quoters shall provide the exact make and part numbers identified herein. No exceptions. Brand name justification is as follows: The NIST Fire Department has a mutual aid agreement with the Montgomery County, MD Fire and Rescue. NIST's equipment must be identical to that used by Montgomery County, to ensure safe, efficient and effective operation and to ensure that NIST firefighters can connect to any Montgomery County first responder in an emergency situation. Breathing air is vital in performing the Fire Department's work. Using Scott SCBA systems permits NIST to buddy breath in an emergency and will ensure 100% compatibility with equipment utilized by NIST and Montgomery County, MD, Fire and Rescue.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
 Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.
 The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. 

Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.  

The Government will make a single award using the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection. The Government intends to award on initial offers but reserves the right to conduct discussions.
	
To be determined technically acceptable, an Offeror must submit a quote that does not take exception to any terms of the solicitation.  The Contracting Officer will use the following rating table:

Rating						Description 
Acceptable					Quote does not take exception to any term of        
 						solicitation and therefore clearly meets the 
						requirements of the solicitation.	

Unacceptable					Quote takes exception to a solicitation  
term(s) and therefore does not clearly meet       
the requirements of the solicitation.
                                              

Pricing will be evaluated based on total price provided in a fully completed price proposal (see 52.212-1).

Failure to furnish the price quote in accordance with the instructions above shall render the quote unacceptable.
 
System for Award Management (SAM). Quoters must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/. 
 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

This process is repeated in order of price until an offer or combination of offers is deemed technically acceptable and price is determined fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Options. When applicable, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>DHS plans to structure this MBA STT Program into five (5) three-year cohorts staggered over seven years.</p>
<p>Responses are due via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Jessica T. Wilson, at Jessica.Wilson@hq.dhs.gov and the Contract Specialist, Mr. Robert Marosz at Robert.Marosz@st.dhs.gov on or before 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on 10/02/2018.</p>

<p>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District is issuing this announcement for the chemical analysis of soils, sediments, sludges, dredge slurries, ground waters, surface waters, air, soil gas, and other environmental samples. These samples have typically been collected from various hazardous and toxic waste site cleanup projects but also may include materials from other sources. Analytical services will be performed by the Contract Laboratory in support of the hazardous waste investigation and remediation programs conducted by, or on behalf of, the Sacramento District. Both primary samples and quality assurance samples will be collected from various hazardous and toxic waste sites, Army or Air Force bases, waste streams, or other typical environmental sample sources. The sampling and analytical work will primarily be in conjunction with investigations and remediation activities for the Department of Defense Environmental Restoration Programs (DERP) which includes military base Installation Restoration (IR), Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), and Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) Programs, RCRA, CERCLA, Military Munitions Response (MMR) sites, mining sites, and additional environmental investigations by the Sacramento District's Environmental Engineering Branch. It is understood that no one lab will be capable of or required to perform all analyses on the list. The lab may sub-contract methods that they do not have capability to perform or hold accreditation in that field of testing. The sub-contracted lab shall meet the same requirements as the primary lab including but not limited to DoD ELAP accreditation and State certification in the applicable field(s) of testing, if the methods are addressed under the certification programs. The sub-contracted lab shall be approved by the technical POC for this requirement. Please review the Performance Work Statement contained in Solicitation W9123818R0024 which shall be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.502 and 5.102. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it from www.fbo.gov on or about 7 May 2018.</p>
