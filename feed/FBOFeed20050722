<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the American Trauma Society (ATS), 8903 Presidential Parkway, Suite 512, Upper Marlboro, MD  20772-2656.  The purpose of the procurement is to provide an instructional DVD outlining the best practices in communicating with and supporting the family of a pediatric trauma victims. The contractor will be required to deliver a copy of the draft pediatric component script and storyboard; a copy of final pediatric component script and storyboard; a copy of draft pediatric component content and DVD cover artwork; a master copy of DVD; a progress report and a final report.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is one year.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  The American Trauma Society (ATS), a national, non-profit, voluntary organization dedicated to the prevention of trauma and the improvement of trauma care, has developed the 2nd Trauma program and has proprietary rights to its contents.  The 2nd Trauma program is designed to improve the communication between the family of a trauma victim and trauma professionals, as well as the support provided to such a family.  The 2nd Trauma program trains such professionals, including physicians, nurses, paramedics, chaplains, social workers, child-life staff, and others to understand and most effectively and compassionately respond to the needs of a victim’s family during the various phases of trauma care.  Using the 2nd Trauma program, the ATS is currently producing a training DVD under contract with HRSA that is geared to an adult population.  The HRSA now recognizes the need to address training on the best practices in communicating with and supporting families of pediatric trauma victims in the pre-hospital, emergency department, and intensive care environments. Based on the 2nd Trauma program model, the ATS is now being asked to produce a second instructional DVD outlining the best practices in communicating with and supporting the family of a pediatric trauma victim.  Because the ATS has proprietary rights to the 2nd Trauma program, it is the only source to fulfill HRSA’s need.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Secure Transportation requires support services for the operation and maintenance of government-owned aircraft in support of the NNSA mission including: (1) air transportation of passengers and cargo to NNSA sites to support training and mission requirements, for research & development and emergency response, for classified and time critical materials to DOE/NNSA sites including the Department of Defense and other federal agencies and contractors; (2) operation of aircraft as aerial platforms in support of research and development programs of DOE and the national laboratories; and, (3) special flights for management and engineering personnel.  The contractor will be required to operate and maintain seven government-owned aircraft including two Douglas DC-9-15Fs, one Douglas DC-9-33F, two deHavilland DHC-6s, one Learjet 35A, and one Gulfstream G-III. This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set-aside.  The NAICS code is 481211 Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation and the size standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract is for five years (a three-year base period & a two-year option). A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated and will stipulate an annual fixed price for a pre-determined quantity of flying hours for each aircraft which includes all operating costs, ground support costs, scheduled maintenance costs (including labor, parts, and materials), in-house labor costs for unscheduled maintenance, in-house labor costs for stores inventory management, overhead, and profit.  The contract will also stipulate an annual fixed price for a pre-determined quantity of flying hours for each aircraft that exceed the annual maximum requirement, and a pre-determined contract line item dollar amount for cost reimbursement of â€œunscheduled maintenanceâ€ costs (including subcontracted labor, parts, materials, and supplies).  Transition costs, if required, will be authorized as pre-contract costs and not be included in offeror price comparisons.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $63M to $68M.  To assist Offerors in developing accurate and complete price proposals, the RFP will specify a reading room in Albuquerque NM for Offerors to review aircraft maintenance records. NNSA contemplates conducting a competitive acquisition using FAR Part 15 procedures, and to make a best value selection using the lowest-price-technically-acceptable process specified in FAR Subsection 15.101-2.  Accordingly, the Offeror having the lowest-price-technically-acceptable proposal will be selected for award. Pass/fail evaluation factors will include but are not limited to (1) possession of an FAA Part 121 Certificate by the Offeror (not its subcontractors or teaming partners), (2) minimum qualifications for key personnel, (3) minimum years of relevant corporate experience, and (4) management plan/technical approach. NNSA will require the apparent successful Offeror (i.e., having the lowest price technically acceptable offer) to undergo a pre-award on-site inspection pursuant to â€œDOE Order 440.2B, Aviation Management and Safety.â€  NNSA inspectors will conduct an on-site review of flight operations and maintenance manuals, operations specifications, safety program documentation, training program and training records, and other areas required by DOE Order 440.2B. A contract will only be awarded after a selected Offeror passes the pre-award on-site inspection.  The RFP will provide Offerors with a copy of the inspection checklist that will be used by the inspectors. For contract performance, NNSA will furnish the contractor with Hanger 481 at Kirtland AFB, NM, office space and furnishings, on-site utilities, and employee parking space for up to 60 individuals as required.  NNSA will also provide all telephone, janitorial services, and on-site mail service.  The contractor will be required to manage, inventory, and account for approximately $31M of government-furnished property (GFP) including aircraft, ground support equipment including trucks and fuel tankers, and low dollar value personal property; a list of all GFP will be included in the RFP.  The contractor will also be required to manage a stores inventory including over $3.4M of spare parts, materials, and related supplies; a summary list will be included in the RFP.  Stores inventory items will not be provided as government-furnished material, however, the contractor will be allowed to withdraw the items for contract performance and then promptly replace the item(s) at contractor expense if used for scheduled maintenance, or reimbursable Government expense if used for unscheduled maintenance.  NNSA will provide all aircraft fuel to the contractor, or may authorize the contractor to purchase fuel to be reimbursed as a direct cost.  NNSA will provide the contractor with Daniel Systems, Complete Aircraft Management Solutions, and Continuous Aircraft Management Program service software for maintenance tracking.  NNSA will provide the contractor with - flight manuals, maintenance manuals, service manuals, historical records, any supplemental-type certificates and FAA field-approved Forms 337, and electrical drawings - for each aircraft. Since contract performance involves access to classified material and certain contractor employees will require a DOE Q or L level access authorization and badges, the contractor shall have a facility clearance; instructions for the submission Foreign Owned Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) documents and related information will be included in the RFP. The Service Contract Act is applicable to this contract, and the RFP will include Department of Labor (DOL) wage determinations for pilots and mechanics covered by collective bargaining agreements, and for non-bargaining service employees.  NNSA has initiated actions to submit SF 98/98a â€œNotice of Intention to Make a Service Contract and Response to Noticeâ€ to the DOL pursuant to FAR 22.1007. A draft statement of work is attached.  Target date for issuing the draft RFP for comment is August 2005, and for the Final RFP - September 2005.  NNSA contemplates conducting a site visit and preproposal conference in Albuquerque NM approximately one week after the final RFP is issued.  Although the incumbent contract expires November 30, 2005, NNSA may if necessary exercise an option to extend it to May 31, 2006.  Any questions or comments regarding this procurement shall only be submitted via the DOE e-Center Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS); questions submitted through other than IIPS such as phone calls or e-mail will not be answered unless re-submitted via DOE IIPS.

<DESC>The goal of this effort is to develop and procure a flight TT&C COMSEC solution.  The hardware element of the solution must not be application specific, but must be able to be programmed for specific applications and algorithms post-production.  Solutions in two form factors are required:  one that can be embedded in satellite communications subsystems, and one that is a standalone end cryptographic unit (ECU) that is based upon the embedded solution.  This effort includes development of both the programmable solution (e.g. hardware) and the programming to be loaded into the solution (e.g. software).  See Note 26.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEASE SPACE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
MIAMI, FLORIDA



The United States Government intends to award a lease extension using other than full and open competition to Koala Miami Realty Holding Co., Inc. The extension will be for 38,274 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of eighteen months.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded. It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government’s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Glynda Grieve, Contracting Officer, at glynda.grieve@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351. Any written comments are to be received within 15 days of the publication of this notice.

The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Quantum Electrical Metrology Division, proposed to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Qualtx Technology, Inc., 23-B Grindstone Drive, Prosper, TX 75078 for a control computer upgrade on their electron cyclotron resonance plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system (ECR System). An upgrade is required since the present computer controlling the ECR System is outdated (MS-Dos) and the computer hardware (i.e. interface boards) are non-serviceable. If the present controlling computer would fail, the ECR System would be unusable until a replacement control system could be retrofitted into the system. An emergency retrofit would require an unacceptable amount of downtime to perform. Therefore, NIST requires a new computer control system obtain from Qualtx Technology, Inc. Qualtx wrote the present (original) controlling software for the original system manufacturer, PlasmaQuest, which is no longer in business.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any responses shall be received in writing no later than August 10, 2005. Anticipated award date is August 11, 2005.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) with the University of  Colorado to investigate optical pumping effects in atomic vapors with the goal of generating high-contrast coherent-population-trapping (CPT) resonances for use in compact atomic clocks. High-contrast resonances are important since they result in increased signal-to-noise and therefore better clock performance. The specific tasks that will be carried out by the University are as follows:  1) Write and publish two papers on the results obtained; 2) study selective population of magnetically-sensitive CPT states using elliptically polarized light and 3) design a compact device based on the results of task 2, capable of demonstrating an increased CPT contrast and better clock stability.

It is the Government's belief that the skills of researchers engaged by the University of Colorado uniquely qualify them for this work. Interested sources proposing to supply the specified services must submit a written qualification statement clearly establishing the capability to meet the above requirements within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.   Responses are due via mail or FAX by August 11, 2005.  No RFQ package is available. This procurement is being conducted per Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13 (NTE $100,000).  Anticipated award date is August 12, 2005.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is conducting a series of interrelated studies aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. The first two studies that will address both public and private policies and initiatives are the Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study and the Employment Study. As the third study in the NCD series, the proposed Financial Incentives Study should: (a) identify among other tasks what factors influence the use of financial incentives by employers, employees and potential employees who are people with disabilities; (b) assess what is needed to address those factors to increase the use of existing incentives and/or create new incentives; (c) look within and beyond the workplace regarding the potential role of financial incentives in the increased hiring of and/or for use by people with disabilities with respect to aspects of living that also impact obtaining and maintaining meaningful employment (e.g., affordable and accessible assistive technology, housing, transportation, health care, personal assistants and other supports); (d) set forth a model that provides economic analysis of benefits to costs for employers, and (e) as appropriate reflect connections with NCD’s Social Security and the employment studies. This could include final report recommendations for necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative changes or new actions that benefit both employers and people with disabilities.  The estimated contract is for 12 months. NCD will distribute its Financial Incentives Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested Parties on April 29, 2005.

NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by June 14, 2005. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of April 29, 2005.

<DESC>Project Title:  Soil molecular probe field sampling for the fungus Albatrellus ellisii or A. fletti.  The long term goal of this work is to have a reliable method with which to easily and cost-effectively sample for fungal species from the mycelium in the soil without having to rely on locating the seasonally and annually variable fruiting of fungal fruiting bodies known as sporocarps.  This work will be based on FY2004 work in which species specific primers were developed and field tested at known sites for two fungal species Albatrellus ellisii and Albatrellus fletti.  The objective of this contract is to determine the relative variability of the mycelium of one of the fungal species, Albatrellus ellisii or Albatrellus fletti, in the soil with:
„X	One visit: the relative variability by sampling at several locations where the species is known to occur,
„X	Additional visits: the relative seasonal variability by sampling at several locations at different times of the year.
In this first effort, soil samples will be collected at three sampling locations where the species is known.  The sampling locations will occur over the broad range of habitat types the species occupies in Oregon and Washington. The Contractor shall analyze the collected data for relative proportion of detection estimates (a.k.a. occupancy) at each sampling location and across all locations and test the data for significant differences in proportions per location.

An optional additional effort would allow for sampling at the same sample locations at different times of the year to characterize the variability in the relative proportions for seasonal differences.
Registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required. Information on this process can be found on the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. David Hallen is the Contracting Officer for this project.

<DESC>1.0	OBJECTIVE
The Government, by means of this Request for Information (RFI), seeks to identify superior remote data capture technologies for recording entries and exits of travelers through Ports of Entry (POEs), determine the state of those technologies, and what production capacity is available near term (9-18 months out). Firms that have the prerequisite background knowledge, experience, and capacity to be able to successfully meet or exceed the requirements described herein are invited to respond.  The Government is seeking to identify equipment and expertise that offers significant improvements in performance and interoperability with similar solutions.

2.0	INTRODUCTION
The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program is an element of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) specifically charged to enhance security, facilitate legitimate travel and trade, ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration system, and to protect the privacy of visitors to the United States. US-VISIT works with other agencies (stakeholders) including Customs & Border Protection (CBP), Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of State (DOS), to enhance border management and traveler security.  This is currently accomplished by leveraging existing systems to retrieve integrated information from a number of different sources.  The information is used to establish the legal basis for entry into and exit from the United States.  The US-VISIT Program and CBP are currently focused on certain non-US citizen individuals entering and exiting the United States, referred to as in-scope travelers.  The Program has deployed identification and verification capabilities at air, sea and land Ports of Entry (POEs) that supports CBP’s ongoing mission and improves the integrity of the immigration system, while also reducing the amount of time needed to process in-scope travelers. Also supports DOS BioVisa program.

CBP currently utilizes three systems. Free and Secure Trade System (FAST) is a program that the United States, Canada, and Mexico use to harmonize their commercial customs programs based on principles of risk management, rigorous prescreening, partnership, and the use of advanced technology.   The conveyances, as well as the drivers, are enrolled in the system and the cargo is pre-screened, which results in a harmonized expedited clearance process.  NEXUS was developed in conjunction with Canada and data is shared between the two countries.  It is not required to register a vehicle in this system. Secure Electronic Network for the Travelers’ Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) was developed independently by the United States and vehicle registration is a requirement. The enrollment process is the same for each of the three systems:  An applicant submits an application to the appropriate program and the government conducts checks.   In the case of FAST and NEXUS Canada performs adjudication as well.  Applicants, who meet base program criteria report to an enrollment center where they are interviewed, have their original identification and citizenship documents reviewed, are fingerprinted and have a digital photo taken.  Low-risk applicants are then issued a Proximity Identification Card (RFID), which is used at the time of entry into the United States.    


The requirements described below reflect the concepts and approaches envisioned for US-VISIT and other agencies, but there is some latitude to reexamine proposed solutions if the benefits of a new technology or approach are significant enough to justify a change. 

3.0	CURRENT ENHANCEMENTS 
While deploying new capabilities at sensitive air and sea POEs, and implementing many of the same capabilities to the busiest land POEs, US-VISIT has also recognized that technology may be used to improve the quality of data used to verify the legal status of in-scope travelers while facilitating travel. The US-VISIT program seeks information on such technologies.  The technology must be compatible and interoperable with existing systems and must be compatible with the environments at existing U.S. POEs.  US-VISIT is currently engaged in a proof of concept activity using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to study the use of remote data capture technology at POEs.  

Current performance is based on passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID technology, but this RFI does not restrict responses to this technology nor does it imply that passive UHF RFID is the preferred technology. Thus, while some of the following discussion uses terminology consistent with passive UHF RFID, potential vendors should not interpret this language as restrictive.   

3.1	The Current US-VISIT Proof of Concept Trials
US-VISIT’s Increment 2C expands upon current capabilities by introducing the issuance of a unique automatic identifier (a-ID) that is capable of being read automatically, passively (readable without action from the traveler), and remotely as an enrolled traveler crosses a land-border POE to either enter or exit the United States or other locations. These a-IDs will be issued at five selected POEs and will consist of an RFID tag embedded within the CBP Form I-94 (Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival - Departure Record).  The following considerations guided the selection of this method of RFID tag issuance.
•	The I-94/I-94W forms (Arrival Departure Record/Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival – Departure Report) are used currently as part of the standard process to record entry into and exit from the U.S.  Under current procedures, DHS only collects information from the form for the first entry and last exit given that the form may be used for multiple entries and exits.  This means DHS is not able to document many crossings.  Our requirement is to capture information on all entries and exits.
•	The embedded device can be sensed remotely, passively, and automatically.  While these requirements are not completely met by the RFID technology in Proof of Concept testing, the Government requires that a-IDs be read under circumstances that include the device being carried in a pocket, purse, wallet, in traveler’s clothes, or elsewhere on the person of the traveler. The device must be readable when the traveler walks into a POE or crosses the border at a POE while riding in a conveyance (e.g. car, truck, or bus).  The traveler should not have to do anything to prepare the device to be read, or to present the device for reading (i.e., passive and automatic use).
•	Readers are located in doorways and in individual pedestrian and vehicle lanes to allow identification of where the token is read and to allow association of the token with the individual and, if applicable, the vehicle in which the token is carried.
•	The device must be readable under all kinds of indoor and outdoor conditions at both the northern and the southern borders of the U.S. and while carried by pedestrians or vehicle occupant  (e.g. cars, trucks or buses). 

4.0	TECHNOLOGY INTERESTS  
Information is now sought regarding remote data capture technologies.  To be considered, technology must include both the device carried by the traveler and the reader of that device.  The maturity of the technology and the ease of integration into the existing communication interfaces and infrastructure will also be a consideration in the government’s evaluation of the information submitted. Other considerations will be power consumption, reliability, maintainability, availability and degree of difficulty in installation; operation and maintenance, spatial footprint, EMI emissions, security, and practicality of use on a national scale at land border POEs. The technology solution shall comply with applicable safety guideline levels for human health.

This RFI is seeking a solution that processes data captured remotely from an object carried by individual pedestrians and vehicle occupants during entry and exit from the United States at the 50 largest land border POEs.  A successful solution has the potential to be used in other operational environments (e.g. air and sea ports) and by other federal agencies.  Thus, the potential application of technologies identified via this RFI is broad.  While not required for this RFI, the strategic goal is to seek a secured solution capable of supporting biometric verification, while protecting the privacy of the individuals carrying the object.

Relevant information gathered during the RFI process will be summarized and shared by US-VISIT stakeholders, including CBP, USCIS, DOS and DOT.   This information may also be considered for use in establishing international standards in border control, passenger processing and travel facilitation systems.

4.1	 Goals 
Several high-level goals apply to this RFI:
•	The enterprise solution developed for the government shall be developed with an Open Architecture and in accordance with International Standards (e.g. ISO 18000.6(b) or successor)
•	The solution must support the need to identify the exact location of the read such as a specific pedestrian or vehicle lane in which the token is read.  
•	The solution presented must sense the remote data capture technology carried by a pedestrian traveler  (i.e., the “token”) at distances up to 25 ft.
•	The solution presented must sense all tokens carried by travelers seated in a single automobile, truck, or bus at a distance up to 25 ft while moving at speeds up to 55 mph.
o	For bus traffic, the solution must sense up to 55 tokens
•	The accuracy and reliability goals of the data capture process are 100%. 
•	For a successful read, the traveler should not have to hold or present the token in any special way to enable the reading of the token’s information.  The goal is for the reader to sense a token carried on a traveler’s person or anywhere in a vehicle.
•	The token will be embedded in or attached to an official travel document and shall not be adversely affected by laser printing, hand stamping, folding, or normal handling of such a document.
•	The solution shall be compatible with the current processes, procedures and operations of US-VISIT and all other stakeholders identified in this RFI.
•	The solution shall minimize facilities modifications; however further development of existing infrastructure is allowed if not extensive.
•	The solution shall be accurate and reliable under conditions of use at border crossing points on both the northern and southern borders of the United States in all extremes of weather. Token-enabled travel documents should remain functional under widely varying use, storage, and carrying conditions over the lifetime of the token. 
•	The solution shall incorporate existing lanes, configurations and systems deployed by CBP and US-VISIT. 
•	Tag and antenna read rates shall exceed 90%, read ranges shall extend to a minimum of 25 feet, and error rates shall not exceed 10%.
•	Compatibility and non-interference in performance of antennas to tags across vendor platforms
•	Compatibility and non-interference in performance with programs such as NEXUS, SENTRI, and FAST  
o	NEXUS/SENTRI/FAST solutions – Intermec Kathrein Antennas, Intermec 2100UAP readers, TransCore eGo 2210 Readers, AA3152 Universal Toll Antennas, Intermec Intelligent tags.
o	US-VISIT Increment 2C Proof of Concept (POC) solution– Symbol AR400 readers, Symbol Max Rad Antennas, Symbol tags














•	Reader fault tolerance, remote diagnostics, field repair, and field upgradeability
•	Fit to mission, with a special emphasis on multi-occupant vehicular traffic moving at speed (0-55 mph)
•	Fit to environment, with a special emphasis on electromagnetic interference (EMI) and FCC Regulations
•	Privacy of travelers shall not be compromised
•	Resistance to forgery/counterfeiting attempts

4.2	Standards
The government’s intention is as follows:
•	For all technologies, the intent is to specify open non-draft standards that are not encumbered by proprietary intellectual property.
•	Reader communication with a middleware host (intended to mediate at least one remote data capture system, and perhaps two or more such systems at each POE) and with a reader maintenance/management system is desired to be via standard-compliant network communications and protocols, and use standard data structures and commands.
•	Encryption, where applicable, shall comply with FIPS PUB 140-2 (Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules).

5.0	SUBMISSION 
A summary paper must be submitted with each response to the RFI. The purpose of the summary paper is to help the government understand your response in the way you believe best represents the application of your product/s to the subject of this RFI.  Responders are requested to provide a complete separate response that describes each system the responder wants to present.  Please do not provide separate responses where differences between components of one response and the next response are minor.  The summary paper should systematically address each of the points addressed in Sections 4.0 through 4.2 above.  All relevant facts and claims must be contained in the summary paper, including summaries of and full references to any substantiating tests or technical evaluations.    The summary paper requested should not be a marketing tool. It is an information tool that will be used by the US-VISIT program and other government agencies in their search for new standards and new technologies with possible application to NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST, and Increment 2C, and to familiarize all stakeholders with the technologies you describe.  The information on the summary paper should be accurate, succinct, complete and descriptive of the technology.  The summary paper reflects how interested parties would like their technology presented in summary form to US-VISIT and should highlight all information the interested parties would like to convey.  The summary paper should not exceed 10 pages using 12-point Times New Roman type. 

Summary papers may be compiled by the Government into a comprehensive Summary Report and be presented to US-VISIT stakeholders. The Summary Report may be categorized by the following criteria.
•	Basic POE Entry & Exit Scenarios
•	Form Factor carried by the traveler
•	Stationary outdoor devices for use on roads
•	Stationary indoor devices for use at entrances, gates, kiosks, and desks
•	Availability and functionality of handheld readers

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.  Please note this  document falls under "DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to  Department of Defense and DOD Contractors only to protect technical or  operational data..."  To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email  request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson,  by COB 18 March 2005.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CLINICAL TRIAL COLLABORATION

UTILIZATION OF MID-URETHRAL SLINGS, RETROPUBIC AND TRANSOBDURATOR SLING PLACEMENT DEVICES IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN WOMEN WITH STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE.


The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide mid-urethral slings and retropubic transobdurator sling placement devices in a NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trial in women with stress urinary incontinence. 

INTRODUCTION:  	The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate and compare approaches (retropubic and transobturator) for surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence in women. The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 500 women and have equal randomization to two surgical approaches, either a retropubic mid-urethral sling placement approach or a transobturator mid-urethral sling placement approach. Enrollment is expected to be completed over 2 years with follow up of a minimum of 24 months and as long as 48 months. Enrollment will occur at nine participating clinical centers (William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan; Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; University of California at San Diego; University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, University of Texas at Dallas; University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah). It is possible 1-3 additional centers will be added.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts.

STUDY GOALS:  The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare objective cure rates for stress incontinence as well as complication rates at 1 and 2 years between these two surgical approaches. Another primary goal is to compare bother scores from stress urinary incontinence between these two surgical approaches at 1 and 2 years. 

Other study aims include: 
-	Comparison of the morbidity between the two approaches which will include intraoperative injury, voiding dysfunction, changes of anatomic urethral support, sling erosion, and other complications.
-	Comparison of patient satisfaction and quality of life variables between the two different approaches. 
-	Comparison of the subjective cure rates of stress incontinence and overall incontinence between the two approaches.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2000, the NIDDK established the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN).  The purpose of the UITN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials of urinary incontinence.  Currently, the UITN is completing a trial comparing two surgical procedures for women with stress urinary incontinence, “A Randomized Clinical Trial of the Burch Modified Tanagho and Autologous Fascia Sling Procedures.”  The second protocol, developed by the UITN investigators is:  “Retropubic Mid-urethral Sling (RMUS) vs. Transobturator Mid-Urethral Sling (TOMUS)”.  Although this protocol has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board and patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in late winter to spring 2006, the collaborator(s) will, nonetheless, have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol. The Collaborator(s) will also participate as an ex-officio member of the Steering Committee.  It is anticipated that the duration of this trial will be at least 4 years, a 2 year recruitment followed by a minimum of 24 months follow-up. The collaborator(s) will need to provide products (slings) and devices for placement (disposable per patient use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) at the time of the surgical procedures. It is anticipated that the need of the products will be during the surgical phase of this study, during the initial 24 month recruitment phase and surgical placement of sling of this trial. The Collaborator (s) is (are) expected to provide the products (mid-urethral slings) and/or the placement device product line (either disposable per use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) for free without charge. The Collaborators may provide either or both sling products and/or placement device products or instruments. The Collaborator(s) may have access to information about the outcome of the study at the same time as the participating investigators.  If desired, the Collaborator(s) may participate as a member of the publication committee.  A Clinical Trials Agreement between the NIDDK and the Collaborator(s) will need to be executed prior to shipment of the products or placement kits or surgical instruments. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following criteria: time line for ability to ship sling product or retropubic or transobturator device kits or instruments after selection of Collaborator is determined and prior studies and approval of safety and use of their product. 

TERMS:	The Collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/CTA-device-extramural.doc.  No funding from the government is available.

SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest should be submitted by 22 August 2005 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by 6 September 2005.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Amendment #3:  Technical Question & Answer:  The response date is still 07/25/05, at 3:00 pm (EST).  Question:   Part of the general description reads: "By outfitting the AUV with a ... side scan sonar unit...", however the  specifications do not list a side scan sonar unit as being part of the requirement.  Should we be bidding our AUV with a side scan sonar? Answer:   No, please follow the minimum specifications (which does not list the side scan sonar).  Therefore prospective contractors do not need to bid the AUV  with a side scan sonar. Amendment #3:  Technical Question & Answer.  The original response date of 07/22/05, has been changed to 07/25/05, at 3:00 pm (EST).  Question:  We have not found that source code or detailed schematics of all electronic circuits necessary for field trouble shooting.  The  vehicle's housing is sealed and normally never opened by the customer.  Fins, propellers, keel weights, and external sensors are field repairable without opening the housing and most are provided in the spares kit.  For added levels of repair necessitating opening the housing, we can provide  procedures for swapping major components such as the battery tray or tail section.  Do we need to provide all of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits to enable field troubleshooting? Answer:  The EPA does  not need the electronic diagrams, but the electric diagrams would be required so that the EPA gets a schematic showing circuitry from battery/fuse to sensors to controller to motor/rudders/propellers, etc., with electronic components blackboxed.  If the instrumentation control and navigation  software has code that is open to end users, then the source code should be provided.  But if the code is closed to end users, then the EPA does not need to see it- just indicate in your proposal that it is closed.   Amendment #2:  Technical question and answer.  The original response date of  07/22/05 remains unchanged. The 90 days to deliver from start of the contract is tight.  We can deliver a working AUV system to EPA within the 90 days but it would not be fitted with the high performance navigation module. The AUV that would be delivered within the 90 days would be operational and  it would be adequate for the EPA technician to start using the AUV and navigating via dead reckoning.  The additional module can be delivered within 150 days of contract start or 60 days after the base unit is delivered. Is this acceptable? Answer:  Yes, that is acceptable Amendment #1  Information:   Technical Question & Answers AUV Requirement,  The Original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. Would there be a problem using a Russian built fuselage with a U.S. designed and built drive and electronics?  Answer:  There is no prohibition against using a Russian built  fuselage, as long as commonly replaced parts (such as O-rings) are readily available (i.e., if the fuselage comes with unusually sized O-rings that are difficult to purchase for replacement, that would be unacceptable). We use high mega-pixel Japanese built SLRs and specialized Japanese video  cameras.  In our system we use a video camera and an SLR - we have the video camera coupled to the eyepiece of the SLR, so that both video and an SLR still use the same optical chain.  Would such a system implementation be acceptable? Answer:   Yes. This is a combined synopsis/request for quote  for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490  for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are as follows:    Synopsis: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an advanced technology, multipurpose swimming robot  that can effectively measure environmental parameters used to access ecological health and species-habitat interactions in aquatic environments.  AUVs  can be configured with a variety of sensor packages to measure water quality, with video cameras to map habitats and biota (e.g. shellfish), and  with side scan sonar to acoustically image seabed properties in both shallow and deep environments. This instrument will be a key component in a variety of research projects at AED in the Habitat Effects Branch, which currently is conducting research in support of the Aquatic Stressors Framework's  plan for Altered Habitat Research and focuses on coastal marshes, estuaries, and near shore habitats at the scale of habitat elements and habitat mosaics up to and including entire coastal ecosystems.   The Aquatic Stressors Framework states that spatial habitat mapping will be a "vital tool" in  application of the stressor-response models, and thus habitat mapping of shorelines, lakes, estuaries, and sub-estuaries should be a part of the quantitative research involved in creating the models.  AUVs are ideal tools for assessing and mapping habitats and biota over large spatial scales and at  speeds comparable to the rate processes of interest.  By outfitting the AUV with a video camera, side scan sonar unit, CTD and dissolved oxygen probe, real-time measurements of habitat quality and quantity (e.g. bottom topography, presence of shellfish beds, dissolved oxygen levels, stratification,  seagrass bed areal extent and level of patchiness) can be collected relatively rapidly.  The habitat and biota data collected by the AUV will be essential for ground truthing, over large spatial scales, the habitat alteration (stressor)-species response models and habitat suitability indices  currently under development by the Habitat Effects Branch.  This instrument will contribute to research that will (1) synthesize habitat quantity, quality, or arrangement (stressors), and (2) quantitatively relate these habitat alteration stressors to fish, shellfish, or wildlife (responses), thus  supporting the Altered Habitat Research Plan's APM 5 (Report characterizing relationships of between abundance, quality, and arrangement of various habitat types ad selected biotic assessment endpoints in coastal systems) and APM 6 (Synthesized quantitative species-habitat relationships suitable  for developing regional habitat-based bio-criteria for shorelines, lakes and estuaries).  As dissolved oxygen level is an assessment endpoint for the Watershed Diagnostics Branch, the AUV, equipped with the fast-response dissolved oxygen sensor, will be a valuable research tool for this branch as  well (APM- Report on the sensitivity of food web responses to nutrient loading coastal systems). In addition, the potential exists for the AUV to be used as a tool for large scale monitoring and assessment efforts in a range of habitats in support of the Coastal Assessment (Goal 8) and Aquatic  Stressors (Goal 2) research efforts. Furthermore, we can conceive potential uses of the AUV at Gulf Ecology Division (GED), Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED), Western Ecology Division (WED) and by EPA regions and partners.   General Specifications: o	The AUV must be easily lifted by two people,  deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components. o	All of the source code for the AUV's  instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is also required. o	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to  corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6?C to 35?C and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10?C to 45?C.   o	A connection to the central  processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting  software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation. o	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data, to the remote computer. o	The AUV should have a  secondary transponder (i.e., pinger locator device) in case of loss of AUV.		 o	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.	 o	When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an  inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates. o	While the AUV is at the surface, a geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS. o	The AUV package must include  rugged shipping containers for all components. o	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship. o	The AUV package must include an expendable items  spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must  be included for all custom AUV components. o	AUV demonstrations by the Contractor must be organized and conducted by the Contractor in coordination with the government representatives.  For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the government representatives' meals, incidental  expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be incurred by the Contractor.   o	Post-award AUV on-site services shall include training on all AUV hardware and software systems. o	The operational performance and  specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to U.S. EPA's AED scientists prior to acceptance of the AUV and associated payment in-full. o	Software must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Minimum Specifications: o	Length: 1.5-3 m o	Weight:    < 100 kg o	Depth rating:  > 100 m o	Sustained (mission) speed:  > 3 knots o	Endurance at mission speed: > 6 hours or 18 nautical miles o	Re-power: via externally rechargeable batteries (through externally accessible connector) and/or easy (< 15 minute) battery swap procedure o	Navigation:  GPS and  inertial navigation, without transponders o	Control Interface:  Vehicle is capable of total autonomy, and provides user-friendly ability to pre-determine vehicle path in 3D by lat/lons as well as by depth and altitude, including a capability for oscillation patterns with depth/altitude.  Knowledge  of specialized computer languages not required. o	Sensor suite and internally recorded parameters:  date, time, conductivity, temperature, depth, altitude, dissolved oxygen, latitude, longitude, heading, speed, battery voltage, and scaled images (see camera requirements below)  o	Maximum  equilibration time for all sensors, including dissolved oxygen:  0.3 seconds. o	Minimum data rate for internally recording the above parameters:  1.0 hertz (exception: camera, see below). o	Camera requirements: 480 line video camera at video rate or (preferred) high-resolution (> 1.0 mega-pixel)  still camera at 0.5 hertz or better.  Camera must include scaling system (parallel lasers, stereoscopy, etc).  All items shall be delivered to the U.S. EPA, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, RI 02882, no later than 90 days after award.

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING ACQUISITION SUPPORT 5 (TEAS 5).  Sources are sought to provide Advisory and Assistance (A&AS) manpower support services in a variety of engineering, technical and acquisition management disciplines for the Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB FL, Hurlburt Field FL, Holloman AFB NM, Kirtland AFB NM, Air Logistics Centers, and other related locations as required.  The AAC was created in October 1998 to provide a single focal point within the USAF for air armament.  AAC develops, acquires, tests, deploys, and sustains air-delivered munitions.  TEAS 5 will provide professional engineering services to support that mission.  The anticipated contract type is a cost-plus-award-fee with miscellaneous cost reimbursable line items.  The current ceiling level of performance is 875 man-years.  Final decision for the acquisition strategy will be made by the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM).  Any potential small business set-asides will be considered within the requirements of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710, size standard of 1000 people.  Foreign participation is excluded.  The TEAS contractor must evaluate the designs and products of AAC’s prime systems contractors.  To ensure full access to those designs and products, the TEAS contractor must not be a competitor of the prime contractors which build air armament systems for AAC.  The TEAS contractor will not be allowed to bid on any other AAC contract, unless a waiver is granted by the TEAS Contracting Officer.  The intent is to utilize unique private sector engineering expertise with demonstrated experience in the area of air-delivered armament to enhance the Air Force's capability to accomplish munitions development and acquisition programs.  Interested sources who feel they can meet the requirement should provide a statement of capabilities that provides the following information related to their demonstrated experience and capability in the area of air-delivered armament:  a)  Potential offerors are to have demonstrated successful experience providing air armament engineering services.  Provide contract information and/or other program information describing your experience in the last ten years relative to air-delivered armament systems.  Provide points of contact (POC), including names, telephone numbers and email addresses, as appropriate, to verify this information.  b)  Technical Capabilities:  A demonstrated capability in engineering services for air-delivered armament and for interface of air armament systems with USAF/USN fighter and bomber aircraft.  The TEAS contractor is to provide a broad range of technical disciplines to meet that requirement, to include aeronautical, electrical, mechanical, materials, environmental, and systems engineering, as well as physics, computer science and operations research.  Further details of these disciplines are contained in the current TEAS 4 statement of work.  Additionally, the TEAS 5 contract is expected to grow in its capabilities along with new and emerging AAC requirements, including transition to air armament products of directed energy technologies, weapons to counter hard and deeply buried targets, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Net Ready Weapons, Counter Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE), Universal Aircraft Interface (UAI), and Persistent Area Dominance (PAD).  Describe your experience in any of these emerging AAC requirements.  c)  Technical Workforce:  The TEAS contractor must have demonstrated the capability to manage a large and diverse work force, including professional engineers, technical support staff, administrative staff, and subcontractor personnel.  The TEAS contractor must have demonstrated the capability to recruit and retain top quality technical employees, including engineers with national and international reputations in air armament engineering disciplines.  Describe your experience in managing a large technical workforce.  Give information relative to the number of people, the technical/management fields represented, and the length of time they were managed.  Give an example of your ability to recruit top quality engineering personnel in air armament engineering disciplines.  d)  Technical leadership:  TEAS 5 contractor personnel will perform tasks defined by Government engineers, but TEAS personnel are supervised by TEAS contractor task order managers.  Since the TEAS 5 contract will be a task order contract, AAC is looking for contractors with demonstrated technical leadership in air armament to select, assign, train, manage, and support its employees.  Describe your experience in managing task order engineering work that is prescribed by Government engineers.  Indicate your experience with integrating with Government engineers, while maintaining your ability to select, assign, train, manage, and support your employees.  e)  Systems Engineering Presence:  AAC is extremely diverse in geographic location, in mission requirements, and in application of technical capabilities.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service is currently performing market research for available technology and supply sources in the area of mail processing indicia detection/image acquisition technology.  Specifically, the USPS has a need due to end of life considerations and advancements in indicia detection technology to integrate a new Indicia Dectector/Image Acquisition System within its ongoing Advanced Facer Canceler System (AFCS) Overhaul Program.  The following information provides background and technical specification information to suppliers.  Sourcing strategies for this technology solution has not been finalized and are dependent on the results of the referenced market research.  Requests for information and performance data submission should be provided to Mr. Mark A. Guilfoil, Manager, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA  22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7891.  Requirements Specification AFCS Indicia Detector/AFCS Overhaul Program.  BACKGROUND:  The Advanced Facer Canceller System, AFCS, is the main letter mail culling, facing, and canceling machine used by the US Postal Service.  The AFCS machines were deployed in the early 1990s.  Much of the technology contained in the AFCS was developed in the mid 1980s.  That technology has reached end-of-life and is now obsolete and difficult to support.  One module within the AFCS that is of particular concern is the indicia detectors.  The indicia detectors are used to locate valid indicia, stamp, meter, or the Facing Identification Mark (FIM).  The location of the indicia is used to determine the orientation of the mail piece and to properly face the mail for subsequent processing.
The purpose of this requirements specification is to list the requirements for a state of the art vision based indicia detector with additional functionality of image capture that can replace the existing indicia detectors on the AFCS.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.  1.  Size:  The portion of the new indicia detector / image lift system that must be mounted on the AFCS transport (i.e. read head) shall fit in the same foot print as the existing indicia detector currently in USPS operations.  The maximum dimension for the transport mounted portion of the indicia detector is 199.5 mm wide, 156 mm deep, and 260 mm high (above the baseplate).  Below the machine transport, there is approximately an area of 750 mm wide, 750 mm deep, and 750 mm high to house additional components of the image lift system.  2.  Mail Piece Feature Recognized:  The indicia detector shall recognize the following features for each mail piece:
• Indicia Type – Postage stamps, postal stationary, meter marks, Information Based Indicia (IBI – Data Matrix and PDF417), and Facing Identification Marks (FIM).  Stamps that have not been issued or authorized by the US Postal Service are not to be identified as indicia, or as a mail piece feature.
• Indicia value for all valid indicia on the mail piece.
• Mail piece orientation, even if no indicia is identified
• POSTNET bar code – presence and value
• PLANET bar code – presence and value
• Four State Bar Code – presence and value
• ID Tag, both US National and International – presence
3.  Indicia Location:  The indicia may be located anywhere on the face of the mail piece and may be in any orientation.
4.  Mail Piece Characteristics:  The mail processed on the AFCS is single piece First Class collection mail, letters and postcards.  There are no requirements that collection mail will comply with any of the mail piece characteristics listed in the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM).  The indicia detector shall be able to recognize the required mail piece features on mail pieces with the following physical characteristics:
• Color – mail piece can be any color
• Size – mail pieces size can vary within the limits listed in the table below:  Minimum Maximum
Length	5.0 inches (127 mm)	11.5 inches (292 mm)
Height	3.5 inches (89 mm)	6.125 inches (155 mm)
Thickness	0.007 inches (0.178 mm)	0.25 inches (6.35 mm)
5.  Transport Speed: The transport speed of the AFCS is 3.8 m/sec ±0.2 m/sec.
6.  Response Time:  The indicia detector must provide information on the orientation of the mail piece within 50 msec.
7.  Processing Rate:	Maximum processing rate of 15 mail pieces per second.
8.  Indicia Recognition Rate:  The indicia (feature) recognition rate shall be > 98%.
9.  Indicia Recognition Error Rate:  The indicia (feature) recognition error rate shall be < 1%
10. Mail Piece Image:  The indicia detector shall provide a 256 dpi grayscale image that is suitable for OCR processing of the full mail piece.  The full mail piece is defined as shown above delineating the minimum and maximum dimensions in height and length,
11. Mail Piece Image Performance:  The 256 dpi grayscale image shall provide the same or better performance as provided by the existing grayscale scanners on the AFCS.  Sort and encode rates will be used to measure OCR image performance.  
12. Maintenance:  The indicia detector shall include built in self test.  The indicia detector shall be self calibrating.  Calibration is to be required no more frequently than once per week.  The time required to complete the self calibration shall not exceed five minutes.  The illuminating system for the indicia detector shall be capable of at least 40 thousand hours of operation without requiring replacement.
13. Environmental:  The indicia detector shall be capable of continuous operation on a letter mail transport in a postal environment.  The indicia detector will not be in a controlled or conditioned environment.  The temperature range is from 50 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  Relative humidity (non-condensing) is from 5 to 70 percent over the temperature range and may increase to a level as high as 80 percent over the temperature range from 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
14. Production Configuration:  To minimize the number of computers on the workroom floor, the indicia detection software is planned to be integrated into the USPS image server that is part of the AFCS Advanced Coprocessor System (ACP) in any production systems ultimately procured.  Respondents will be provided with specifications concerning the computers used within the ACP upon request.  SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES.  For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide performance data for available systems for USPS review.  This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendors ability to meet the requirements in this specification.  This written information shall be provided no later than September 15, 2005.  Minor variations to the values expressed within the above specification, with the exception of Item 1. Size requirements, will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications.  In the event that a potential vendor is currently or plans to develop a system which will meet the requirements provided herein, such vendor must provide a date by September 15, 2005 when those development activities would be completed and their system be available for USPS review.  Testing plans will be developed and announced after USPS review of submitted system performance data.  The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with this AFCS component.  A determination concerning any procurement approach would be made after review of the responses to this technology assessment and comparison of its results to internal schedule requirements.  The USPS by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to acquisition of any indicia detector/image capture system.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Support Equipment Commodity Council Final Requirements Conference
<DESC>The Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) at WR-ALC will host a final requirements conference on 5 Aug 05, at WR-ALC.  The conference will be held in two sessions in Building 376, Room 404.  The facility allows anonymous interaction with the SECC team.  Industry representatives will have the ability to pose questions without revealing the source of the issue/question and all responses will be provided to the group.  Minutes of both sessions, including all questions and answers will be provided to attendees from both sessions and will be made available on the SECC web-site. The sessions are scheduled as follows:

8:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. – Mechanical Items Group
1:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. – Electronic Items Group

The spreadsheet for all of the known SECC items with a FY06 and FY07 forecast can be found at:  http://pkec.robins.af.mil    

The spreadsheet identifies each item by a designator in Column A with the appropriate assigned indicator, M (Mechanical) or E (Electronic).  The spreadsheet is an updated version (June 05) of the previous spreadsheet used for the SECC Industry Day, held in Apr 05. These items have been reviewed by the affected Supply Chain Managers (SCMs) and they have recommended the Mechanical or Electronic designators.  As has been previously stated, this is the best available information regarding the potential buys for the identified fiscal years.  Based on user needs and funding, the types and quantities of items to be purchased may change.  

The purpose of this conference is to provide all available information to industry regarding the proposed strategy to support the acquisition of the items identified on the current spreadsheet.  Issues regarding pricing, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), required metrics, source selection criteria and evaluation, and other issues which will affect the strategy (and ultimately the solicitation) will be discussed.  This is an opportunity for industry representatives to interact with the SECC team members to make further recommendations, identify any potential obstacles, and propose recommendations to outstanding issues regarding the actions to be taken.  The proposed strategy for support of these items will be to solicit and evaluate proposals for at least two (one Mechanical and one Electronic) prime/vendor type contracts.  It is anticipated that this effort will be a small business set-aside and potentially other set-aside actions.  Additional information, including a draft Statement of Requirements, draft solicitation, all minutes to meetings held with industry, and any other information pertinent to this proposed acquisition will be posted to the web-site identified above.  

The anticipated date of a formal solicitation release is in fourth quarter of 2005.  The intent of the requirements organization is to have contracts executed in early 2006.  The proposed acquisition schedule necessary to support this requirement will be discussed at the conference.

Seats at the facility are limited and only one representative from each company will have access to the anonymous computer capability (there are 30 computer seats).  The room will accommodate up to 60 people.  Reservations will be made on a first-come, first-confirmed basis.  Contact Linda Ralston at 478-222-3775 to confirm reservations for a particular session.  All reservations must be made no later than 2 Aug 05.  Reservations must be made to a specific session.  Attendance at both sessions will be limited if necessary to accommodate representatives participation at specific sessions.  The PCO for this action is Tammy Parkerson, 478-222-3774.

<SUBJECT>F -- Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Plant and Animal Species Data Services
<DESC>It is the intent of the Forest Service to award the following services on a sole source basis to the State of Washington Department of Natural Resources because of the requirement to use NatureServe methodology for animal data for the state and no other private, state, or federal entity in Washington State has the authority, the information, the experience, or the ability to manage, synthesize data, and maintain a comprehensive database  for rare species. Contractors who believe that they could successfully perform the services listed should contact the Contracting Officer, David Hallen, at 503-668-1667.

The work consists of five components:  
 
1) Providing a list of eligible non-vascular plants (lichens, bryophytes) and fungi that meet Forest Service criteria and the associated documented and suspected status for each National Forest in Washington, plus the rationale for the Heritage rankings 
2) Providing a list of eligible vascular plants that meet Forest Service criteria and the associated suspected status for each National Forest, plus the rationale for the Heritage rankings
3) Producing species fact sheets for a selected list of non-vascular plants, and
4) Producing fact sheets for a selected list of invertebrate species.
5) Information management,

1)  Information Management 
The Contractor shall provide computer data services on State of Washington endangered, threatened, and sensitive plant and animal species.  This includes:
• maintaining element occurrence records for National Forest lands within the State of Washington in the Washington Natural Heritage Program  (WNHP) Biotics database, and
• incorporating all new and revised data provided by the Government into the WNHP Biotics database.

For flora, information will be submitted to the Contractor from individual National Forests for species on the Region 6 Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species Plant list including vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and fungi.  The information will be submitted on Region 6 Rare Plant Sighting forms or the WNHP Rare Plant Field Survey Form or in a mutually agreed upon electronic format that is compatible with the data system.  When the Natural Resource Information System (NRIS) TES Plants module is issued to the field, then electronic transfer of data would occur from TES Plants to Biotics.  There would not be a need for transfer of paper copies.

For fauna, information will be submitted to the Contractor from individual National Forests for species on the Region 6 Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species Animal list.  The information will be submitted on the WNHP Animal Field Survey Form or in a mutually agreed-upon format (hard copy or electronic) that is compatible with the data system.  When the NRIS Fauna module is fully functional in the Region, then electronic transfer of data would occur from Fauna to Biotics.  There would not be a need for transfer of paper copies.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source bases, a Firm-Fixed Price acquisition with International Simulation & Training Systems (ISTS) for the A-10 Full Mission Trainer (FMT) Brief/Debrief (BDB) System in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Air Combat Command (ACC) in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The ACC is in need of the A-10 FMT Brief/Debrief System to provide networked visual and audio mission briefing and debriefing functions to support pilot mission planning and debriefing.  The proposed acquisition is necessary to integrate the ACC A-10 FMT into the established Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) system.  The ACC systems require 100 percent hardware and software compatibility with Air National Guard systems, plus seamless integration with the Air Reserve Forces Network (ARCNET) and the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON).   ISTS is the sole provider of connectivity-engineering services to nine USAF locations worldwide for integration of A-10 FMTs into the ARCNET and DMON networks.  These services support all USAF DMO requirements.  ISTS has engineered unique, custom designed software-hardware protocols facilitating A-10 simulator connection to identify secure environments.  These protocols are paramount in integrating the proposed ACC BDB system to ISTS maintained BDB baseline configurations and are required to assure commonality across all A-10 simulators.   This is not a request for competitive proposals.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact Mr. Paul Martin at (703) 787-1113 or via email at paul.martin@mms.gov by COB Monday, August 8, 2005.

- Simple adjustment of the hydraulic pressure allows the operator to change the planter response to rough sites or soft field conditions. 
(6)  Depth control of planted seeds using adjustable depth wheels. Seed may be planted too deeply in loose (sandy) or very dry soils with the standard rangeland drill. It is also essential that different seeds be planted at appropriate depths with adjustable, hydraulic depth control. Many native seeds require seed burial at depths that range from 3 to 4 inches (Indian ricegrass) to less than 1/8th of an inch (sagebrush). 
-  Adjustable side mounted depth/gauge wheels.  
-  Controls seeding depth and surface disturbance
-  Semi pneumatic rubber wheel mounted on 4-bolt hub with tapered roller bearings and exclusive floating axle.
(7)  Drill must be capable of withstanding the rigors of operation in a rangeland situation. 
-  Heavy-duty, planting units arranged in two ranks with a front to back separation of 48 inches for maximum trash clearance. Ground penetration caused by 4 tons riding on planting discs mounted at a 7-degree angle to vertical and a 7-degree angle to horizontal. 
-  Rockshafts constructed from 2.5 inch solid bar steel.
-  Planter mounted on heavy duty parallelograms, planter mounts are torsion  knuckles. 
(8)   Provide a firm seedbed by the use of detachable, individual press wheels attached behind the seeding mechanism on the drill. Native plants require good seed to soil contact that is not present when drills without press wheels are used (e.g., the standard rangeland drill). Press wheels – Semi pneumatic rubber with 3 inch by 13 inch “V" Tread.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Statement of Work: 
1.	Introduction
1.1	Organization

Transportation Services Administration (TSA) 
701 South 12th Street
Arlington, VA 22202
2.	Objective
The purpose of this project is to bring TSA into compliance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards for document email archive and retrieval.  TSA requires a scalable Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware and software solution to accommodate current and future email requirements for email archive and retrieval.  
3.	Background
TSA has had a steadily increasing volume of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests since its creation. The FOIA requests frequently involve collecting data resident in corporate email.  TSA currently has no system in place that can search the enterprise email system to quickly respond to these requests.  It has become critical for TSA to affect information exchange with external systems.  Hence, an email archival and retrieval system is paramount to operational effectiveness and essential to TSA¡¦s mission. 
	TSA has clusters of Microsoft Exchange 2000 servers located at both their Hosting Center (HC) in Hazelwood, Missouri (MO) and at TSA Headquarters (HQ) in Arlington,	Virginia (VA).  Currently, TSA currently has approximately 20,000 email accounts that require the use of a COTS e-mail archive and retrieval system between the two locations, of which, about 2,500 users are located at the TSA HQ facility.  A COTS e-mail archival and retrieval solution (engineered solution) must provide TSA the ability to immediately 	retrieve data that has been archived to the Storage Area Network (SAN) without 	additional effort from the user.  The transition of e-mail and attachments must be seamless.  TSA 	requires the data to be archived 30 days from date of receipt.  A log of all transactions shall be kept in a database (Oracle RDBMS is preferred) and will be retrievable for the purposes of non-repudiation, and record keeping using industry best practices.  
4.	Scope 
This SOW requires the contractor to provide a COTS email archival and retrieval system to include application software, system implementation, system maintenance and training.  This system must satisfy the functionality outlined below and must be hosted on a suite of standard COTS hardware and integrated with standard COTS network storage devices for an engineered solution for TSA.  Parameter set-up coupled with installation and check-out will be required (unique application development is not expected).  

Server and storage hardware are integral parts of the engineered solution and will be provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Equipment upon contract award.  Contractor support will be required for a period of one (1) year after solution implementation.  The engineered solution for COTS email archival and retrieval system must support both TSA HQ in Arlington, Virginia and HC in Hazelwood, Missouri.  Upon identifying an engineering solution, the server and storage hardware will be provided to the TSA ITMS integration contractor for testing and verification.  Pending successful verification by the TSA ITMS contractor, the contractor shall implement the COTS email archival and retrieval solution at both the TSA HQ and HC facilities. 
	Note:  This work will require a joint effort between the contractor and the TSA ITMS contractor to ensure a successful deployment of the COTS email archival and retrieval solution.  Final acceptance will occur via TSA deliverable submission and acceptance form.  See Attachment G. 
5.	Technical Requirements
5.1	Research and obtain COTS software package for implementation of an email archival and retrieval system to be hosted on a suite of standard COTS hardware and integrated with standard COTS scalable network storage devices.
5.2	Provide equipment Bill of Materials, that includes as a minimum: servers, storage devices, and associated operating system software.  Hardware devices specified will be provided to the successful contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).
	5.3	Procure software products necessary for successful implementation and operations, including the operating system software, application system software and client licenses that may be required.
5.4	Parameter set-up coupled with installation and check-out (unique application development is not expected).
	5.5	Complete system documentation.  Be specific and all inclusive.
5.6	Develop and support an implementation plan to test the engineered solution at the TSA ITMS provider¡¦s test facility located in Reston, VA.
	5.7	Provide engineering labor hours necessary for the successful implementation at the TSA HQ and HC facilities.
	5.8	Proposed email and retrieval system maintenance support for a term of one year from implementation. 
6.		Solution Requirements
6.1	Must minimize the use of proprietary software.  Any proprietary metadata required for achieving full functionality of the proposed engineered solution must be identified and it purpose explained completely.
6.2	Engineered solution documentation must support enterprise disaster recovery.
6.3	Engineered solution must be compatible with Microsoft Windows 2000 Data Center on the Unisys ES7000 platform.  The solution must also be compatible with Microsoft Windows 2003 and Exchange 2003.
6.4	Engineered solution must support Network Addressable Storage (NAS).
6.5	Engineered solution must provide continuous access to archived content transparently to end users.
6.6	Engineered solution must provide flexibility to open storage (SAN, NAS, CAS, Optical, Tape or Magnetic Disk.)
6.7	Engineered solution must support indexing. 
6.8	Engineered solution must support multiple account names.  TSA is using multiple account names within the email system.  This type of configuration can be challenging when associating the separately assigned accounts as aliases to an individual user.  Such association will also be required during the execution of a discovery.  The solution must accurately recover all of a user's historical messages.  
6.9	Engineered solution support the ability to log supervisor activity for future review or for evidentiary purposes.
6.10	Engineered solution must provide discovery request responses in an electronic form for investigation.  The original format must be either Microsoft Exchange or XML.  The preferred method for secondary storage is XML for compatibility with external entities.  Response to a discovery request must be allowed to be exported in a bulk fashion and in a format compatible with the requesting party.  
6.11	Engineered solution must support the ability to reach archived emails through Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA).  Access to network mapped drives is desirable but not required.
6.12	Engineered solution must have simple intuitive user interface and wizards saving time and effort in setting it up and defining policies. 
6.13	Engineered solution must have administration integrated with Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

        of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
