Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p>INSTRUCTIONS<br />1. Below is a document containing a description of the Mobile User Objective System requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />a. Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business.<br />3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.<br />4. The Government is looking for a response no longer than 10 pages in length on the respondent's capability to perform.<br />5. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to 1st Lt Nicholas Tapp, E-4B Procurement Contracting Officer, at nicholas.tapp.1@us.af.mil</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of market research being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF). This market research is being conducted to determine competition for this requirement by identifying potential sources and to gauge small business interest to determine whether or not this requirement can be satisfied with a Small Business Set-Aside. <br />The Government will use the information gathered through publication of this SSS to determine the best acquisition strategy for this requirement. The Government is interested in all potential sources including Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a) businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, etc.<br />Potential sources shall be capable of furnishing all labor, materials, facilities and equipment required to accomplish the procurement of the item(s) listed below. Generally, the work to be accomplished includes non-recurring engineering, procurement, testing, preservation, packaging, and installation, delivering this capability to the operational organization. Additionally, potential sources may be responsible for supply chain management, logistics planning, forecasting production requirements, long-lead time parts procurement, diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortage issues, and shipping serviceable assets for this effort in the future.<br />Potential sources may be responsible for nonrecurring engineering costs associated with becoming an approved source.<br />Please Reference FA8106-19-MUOS in all correspondence.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 541330 Engineering Services<br />SBA Size Standard: $38.5 Million, Engineering Services, Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons<br />Requirement Information: UHF SATCOM - Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) for the E-4B Aircraft</p>
<p>PRODUCTION INFORMATION<br />The service requirements are for the non-recurring engineering, manufacture/procurement, testing, documentation, delivery and installation of an E-4B MUOS system. The E-4B/National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) currently uses the USC-42 radio for backend UHF SATCOM mission support. This radio is becoming non-supportable. In addition, this radio does not support the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capabilities that the Department of Defense has mandated.<br />Responses to this SSS will be utilized to form an Acquisition Strategy Plan (ASP) for the upgrade of the UHF SATCOM system on the E-4B. Respondents detailed understanding of the complexities and integration challenges of this system in support of voice and data communications required to support the NAOC mission set will be used to establish the Government's ASP. It is currently unknown if this action is competitive in nature or if Small Businesses have the understanding of a UHF system to participate in competition. <br />In order to be considered for this aircraft modification, respondents shall supply the Government with enough detail of how they would integrate a radio into the E-4B mission suite while working through the E-4B environmental complexities of the E-4B. For access to the environmental complexities please contact nicholas.tapp.1@us.af.mil or call (405) 739-4342. The complexities will not be posted publicly but only emailed directly to those interested vendors. The radios the Government is currently reviewing, in a separate study, either the Rockwell/Collins ARC-210, model RT-1990C Generation 5 or a Raytheon ARC-231, model RT-1808A. The Contractor shall discuss integration of either radio. The integration of the radio must not adversely impact the voice and data missions of the NAOC. This SSS is not to search for additional radios as the aforementioned study is reviewing this information.<br />Also included in the response, the interested vendors shall discuss a sample schedule based on production or fabrication of the system and an estimate in months to develop, integrate, test and install. Lastly, the interested vendors shall provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM), for this effort rounded to the nearest $100K for both non-reoccurring engineering and for the installation/remainder of the effort.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED SOLICITATION INFORMATION<br />Estimated Solicitation Date: August 2018<br />Estimated Solicitation Closing/Response Date: September 2018<br />PR#: TBD</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY &amp; TECHNICAL DATA<br />The work specified in this SSS does not have any associated technical data available for distribution at this time. The Government is currently developing a Performance Work Statement along corresponding data to provide if a future solicitation is issued. <br />NOTE: Potential sources should only submit questions regarding this post to the above email address. DO NOT CONTACT THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS POST WITH QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:<br />This SSS is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Information, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotation) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.<br />The information in this notice is based on current information as of the publication date.

<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.216-1 Type of Contract</p>
<p>The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>252.229-7999 Taxes - Foreign Contracts in Afghanistan. (DEVIATION 2013-O0016)</p>
<p>(a) This acquisition is covered by the Agreement regarding the Status of United States Military and Civilian Personnel of the U.S. Department of Defense Present in Afghanistan with Cooperative Efforts in Response to Terrorism, Humanitarian and Civic Assistance, Military Training and Exercises, and other Activities, entered into between the United States and Afghanistan which was concluded by an exchange of diplomatic notes (U.S. Embassy Kabul note No. 202, dated September 26, 2002; Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs notes 791 and 93, dated December 12, 2002, and May 28, 2003, respectively), and entered into force on May 28, 2003.</p>
<p>(b) The Agreement exempts the Government of the United States of America and its contractors, subcontractors and contractor personnel from paying any tax or similar charge assessed within Afghanistan. The Agreement also exempts the acquisition, importation, exportation and use of articles and services in the Republic of Afghanistan by or on behalf of the Government of the United States of America in implementing this agreement from any taxes, customs duties or similar charges in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall exclude any Afghan taxes, customs duties or similar charges from its contract price.</p>
<p>(d) The Agreement does not exempt Afghan employees of DoD contractors and subcontractors from Afghan tax laws. To the extent required by Afghanistan law, contractors and subcontractors are required to withhold tax from the wages of these employees and to remit those payments to the appropriate Afghanistan taxing authority. These withholdings are an individual's liability, not a tax against the Contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>5152.225-5915 Contractor Accountability and Personnel Recovery (Jun 2014)</p>
<p>(a) Contract performance may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.</p>
<p>(1) Unaccounted Personnel: It is the expectation of the USG that any contractor brought into Afghanistan for the sole purposes of performance of work on a USG contract must be accounted for at all times by their respective employers. Additionally, contractors who maintain living quarters on a USG base shall verify the location of each of its employees' living quarters a minimum of once a month. If a DoD contracted employee becomes missing and evidence does not indicate foul play, a Personnel Recovery (PR) event is NOT automatically triggered. Such an event will be treated as an accountability battle drill by the employer's chain of command or civilian equivalent.</p>
<p>(2) Contractor Responsibilities: The contractor is responsible to take all necessary steps to locate and investigate the unaccounted for employee(s) whereabouts to the maximum extent practicable. To assist in this process, contractors may use the Operational Contracting Support Drawdown Cell as a resource to track or research employee's last known location and/or to view LOA's. All missing personnel will immediately be reported to the installation division Personnel Recovery Officer (PRO), Mayor's cell, Military Police Station and/or the Criminal Investigative Division, and the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC).</p>
<p>(3) Contractor Provided Information: If it is determined that a potential criminal act has occurred, the USD PRO (or USFOR-A Personnel Recovery Division (PRD) with prior coordination) will attempt to validate the missing person's identity through the employer. The contractor shall provide the information to the PRD within 12 hours of request. The required information the contractor should keep on file includes but is not limited to: copy of the individuals Letter of Authorization generated by the Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker System (SPOT), copy of passport and visas, housing information of where the individual resides such as room number and location, DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data, copy of badging, and contact information for known friends or associates.</p>
<p>(b) If USFOR-A PRD determines through investigation that the unaccounted personnel have voluntarily left the installation either seeking employment with another contractor or other non-mission related reasons, PRD will notify the contractor. The contractor shall ensure that all government-related documents such as LOA's, visas, etc. are terminated/reconciled appropriately within 24 hours of notification by PRD in accordance with subparagraph (a)(8) of DFARS Clause 252.225-7997 entitled "Contractor Demobilization". Contractors who fail to account for their personnel or whose employees create PR events will be held in breach of their contract and face all remedies available to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(c) Contractors shall notify the Contracting Officer, as soon as practicable, whenever employee kidnappings, serious injuries or deaths occur. Report the following information:</p>
<p>Contract Number<br />Contract Description &amp; Location<br />Company Name</p>
<p>Reporting party:<br />Name<br />Phone number<br />e-mail address<br /><br />Victim:<br />Name<br />Gender (Male/Female)<br />Age<br />Nationality<br />Country of permanent residence</p>
<p>Incident:<br />Description<br />Location<br />Date and time</p>

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§ 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§ 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Â§ 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.
