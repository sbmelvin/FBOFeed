The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 22 Contracts Office, is seeking sources for Medical Warehouse Shelving for Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS).

GENERAL INFORMATION
1..  Background.  
     The current shelving in the VA San Diego Central Distrubution Warehouse is outdated and not designed for medical supply storage. The current shelving is designed for bulk products that are on pallets or in boxes. This doesn t meet standards set by the Joint Commission or by the Quality Control inspection survey that is conducted annually. 
Scope. 
Due to the complexity of the transition of the old shelves to the new shelves as the Warehouse can t be shut down for any time period and due to the end of year requirements that Supply Chain Management is responsible for we don t need the shelving to be delivered until late October and install in November between Veterans Day and Thanksgiving as this will give us the most flexibility and have the least effect on daily operations. 

3. Specific Tasks.  

 The vendor will be responsible for the building of all of the new shelving which will occur in our receiving cage. As storage racks are completed the old shelving will be taken apart and removed by VA San Diego personnel. This will need to be done in phases to ensure medical supplies aren t mixed up as it is critical not to affect patient safety. The new shelving will installed by the vendor until all shelving has been completed. This will need to occur during non-operational hours between 3:30P.M and 7:00 A.M. again to not effect day tot day operations.  


Task 1 - Enterprise Management Controls.  
 
4. Performance Monitoring

The Contracting Officer Representative will work with the vendor once awarded and complete a pre-install worksheet that was discussed during the pre-procurment phase. During the installation the COR will continue to ensure that the project is going as plan and that all items that were purchased have been received. Any issues with the vendor will be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. 
5. Security Requirements
Not Applicable

6.  Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI).  

 VA San Diego will provide forklift or material handler support for the offloading of the shelving. 

7.  Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations. 

 a.  Identification of Possible Follow-on Work.  
         If additional work or there are issues with the storage system the COR will work with the Vendor and notify the Contracting Officer. 

 b.  Identification of Potential Conflicts of Interest (COI). 
   Not Applicable 
     c.  Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements. 
  Not Applicable

d.  Packaging, Packing and Shipping Instructions.  

   e.  Inspection and Acceptance Criteria.  

  SCM will review the packing slip and check boxes, pallets for damage and report immediately if any damage is found. SCM will complete the receiving report for all line items received and once installation is completed will complete the receiving report for installation. 

8. Risk Control
Not Applicable 
9.  Place of Performance. 
VA San Diego Healthcare System 
3350 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, CA 92161
West Loading Dock   The Central Warehouse is located right next to the dock. 

10.  Period of Performance. 
October 2018 to November 2018

11.  Delivery Schedule. 

Will need to know the footprint of the amount of pallets to determine if we will need to stagger shipping as space is a premium with the VA La Jolla Facility.

Appendix C

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE
1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be
subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA
information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with
VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid
security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be in the U.S.
to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when
an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
f. No patient information can be pulled or stored on portable X-ray unit. Cassettes are used to record the subject and removed from unit when procedure is finished.
g. Contractor will comply with VA Handbook 6500.6 that states they will ensure VA sensitive information will be protected

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be
responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and

<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  <br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard.</p>
<p>The need is to understand energy expenditure in frail malnourished older persons.  In general, studies of energy expenditure in old age have included primarily high functioning, fairly healthy older people.  The chance to assess frail older persons and controls, as will participate in this study, will provide important new scientific information.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of the study is therefore to measure energy expenditure in a free-living environment for the participants in the PROMISS Study Task 2.2, a methodological study composed of a laboratory examination day and a two-week measurement period in free-living conditions, comparing 50 well-nourished and 50 malnourished Danish men and women aged 80+ years.  This measurement will allow calibration of accelerometry instruments across populations.  The desired result would be to have this measurement collected on all participants.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work: <br />1.	Train the staff in Odense to administer the doses of the labeled water,<br />Training will take place by Skype or other distance-learning medium. <br />2.	Prepare the doses of heavy water for administration<br />3.	Ship the doses of heavy water to Odense where the measurements will be made<br />4.	Have a quality control call once a month to assess problems in the administration of the protocol<br />5.	Receive calibration and end-period urines for analysis<br />6.	Analyze calibration and end-period urine for energy expenditure<br />7.	Prepare dataset for main study analysis for every 50 subjects and send this to Odense<br />8.	Participate as a consultant as appropriate in manuscripts resulting from this project. The lead investigator should be an internationally recognized authority on this method and on the data for energy expenditure that is the product.  His participation in the papers resulting from this study would enhance the explanation of the methods and the interpretation of the data.</p>
