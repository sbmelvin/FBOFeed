<DESC>The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to award on a sole-source basis to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine a contract to continue to support the HIV Research Network.  This is a continuation of work previously conducted by Johns Hopkins University.  The contract is to collect and analyze data related to health services utilization by persons with HIV infection during CY 2006-2008.  Provider sites that participate in this network both provide clinical care to patients with HIV infection and transfer clinical and resource utilization data on these patients to a central data center.  The data center amalgamates the data from the various sites, puts the data into a uniform format, conducts analyses of the assembled data, and prepares reports that address issues concerning (1) utilization of resource by persons with HIV disease, and (2) procedures to reduce the likelihood of medical errors in the treatment of HIV.  This project requires the contractor to have close contacts with clinical sites providing HIV care, and to have established procedures and protocols whereby the site transfers specific data elements from existing clinical records to the contractor.  A significant component of activity in this project consists of obtaining medical record data from HIV provider sites and working with each site to ensure that data are transmitted in a uniform format.  Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has been engaged in this activity since October 1998 and already has several years of data assembled and has established close relationships with staff at each of the 17 provider sites.  We know of no other entity that has developed data sharing procedures with an equivalent number of sites in several states across the country.  The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It is anticipated that one award will be made with a period of performance of three years.  Award of contract is expected in September 2006.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Once in the AHRQ home page, go to Funding Opportunities, then Contract Solicitations.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  No bidders list will be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ and a peer review panel.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about June 5, 2006.

<SUBJECT>R--Marine Corps Systems Command, Commerical Enterprise Omnibus Support Services (CEOss) Open Season
<SOLNBR>CEOSSOS07
<CONTACT>Mark Hoyland 703-432-3781
<DESC>RFI --The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY07.  This notice provides information for both current and new vendors wishing to participate in the Command’s Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August, 2002.   To date, $570+ million in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $150K to $10 million.  CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404(b), which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  Twenty-seven competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.  CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated FY07 Command requirements.  Additionally,  CEOss assesses the nee!  d for new prime vendor awards in selected domains.  For FY07, openings are anticipated in the ES and SE domains; unrestricted as to business size.  A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors during the week of 12 June 2006, which will provide detailed information about Command requirements and RFI submission guidance.  Vendors are required to register for this workshop by submitting an email to the ACSS mailbox (acss@usmc.mil) NLT 5 June 2006.  Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints.  CEOss Background Information:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.  Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.  There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering (SE), Business and Analytical (BA), Engineering and Scientific (ES), and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative (ALA).  Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.  To qualify for consideration in the ES domain you must possess either a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or IT (70) schedule.  To qualify in the SE domain, you must possess either a MOBIS (874), PES (871), IT (70), Environmental Services (899), or Lab Testing !  (873) schedule.  Although vendors may have a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted. Instructions for new CEOss applicants:  To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors should submit the following information NLT 30 June 2006:   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages that identifies their firm’s capabilities within a domain of prime interest (ES or SE) and a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.  All business sizes will be considered for the ES and SE domain openings.  However, based upon responses to this RFI, ACSS will determine if there is viability in pursuing restricted competition in one, or both, open domain(s).   Vendor submissions will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firm’s pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.  Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 17 July 2006.  Responses will be due within fifteen (15) business days, inclusive of teaming arrangements.  Competitive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 21 August 2006.   Currently, there is no formal requirement and this is only a Request for Information (RFI).  RFI responses can be mailed to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester St., Attn: Ms. Anita Norris, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-6050. Instructions for existing CEOss Prime Vendors:  To reconstitute teaming relationships on your existing CEOss BPA, you are required to submit the following information:  An initial letter of intent (LOI), limited to two (2) pages, that discusses changes to team members, your ability to meet prescribed competition thresholds, discounting policy, and rationale for the new team to continue to support MCSC programs.  This must be submitted NLT 16 June 2006.  Revised proposals are due in accordance with the schedule on ACSS web site.  This must be accompanied by a copy of your selected team members’ GSA Schedule, and single, updated MS Excel spreadsheet of all of the GSA rates for your team from September 2006-September 2008 (including rates from existing GSA team schedules).  Do not submit this in .pdf format, it must be a single .xls file with one rate schedule per worksheet.

<RESPDATE>053006
<ARCHDATE>06292006
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609-485-4380
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Ground Facility (LGF) requires valid ranging source error estimates for all Global Positioning Service (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) satellites in view within a specified reception area.  Error estimates from a prototype LGF have been provided to the LAAS specification team in order to validate of the requirements of the specification using a dual-port L1 only antenna design.  While the dual-port design is effective, it requires additional receiver hardware.   A simpler broadband (L1/L2/L5) single-port design with reduced siting constraints would benefit the LAAS program by reducing the complexity of the validation prototype.  A review of the literature shows a number of antennae that have been proposed and built with these design goals, but, to date, none have proven feasible.  BAE Systems has independently researched and developed an antenna design that potentially will provide reception on multiple frequencies, with a large desired to undesired ratio reception pattern and low-error GPS measurements.  If the design concept proves successful, LTP data collection and operational capabilities will be greatly expanded. On June 25, 2005, the FAA issued a public announcement for a prototype antenna that could: â€¢	Be capable of receiving GPS signals on L1, L5, and L2 within the reception mask specified in FAA-E-2937A. â€¢	Provide the received signals on a single antenna port for all elevations between 5 and 90 degrees. â€¢	Provide a desired to undesired amplitude ratio for single reflection ground-induced multipath of at least 30dB for elevation angles between 5 and 35 degrees. â€¢	Provide an omni-directional azimuth gain pattern, ï‚±1dB, as a function of elevation. â€¢	Provide the signals without any azimuth dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding ï‚±1cm. â€¢	Provide the signals without any elevation dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding ï‚±1cm. â€¢	Provide the signals utilizing multiple right-hand circularly polarized antenna elements. Technical Approach:  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, assembly and demonstration shall be conducted in two separate phases.  The first phase is assembly and proof of the basic properties of the reception element.  The second optional phase will include assembly and testing of a complete prototype antenna array.   Performance verification shall consist of controlled laboratory tests, antenna test range measurements, and reception of the live GPS SPS constellation.  The FAA will conduct validation testing. The contractor must have in in-depth understanding and expertise in antenna design and manufacturing and be fully cognizant of FAA's research and development activities and objectives for this type of equipment.  In addition, the contractor must have access to resources and facilities to perform all research tasks. At that time, BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Inc. (BAE) was determined to be the only source with the requisite design and technical capabilities.  No other companies submitted a response demonstrating comparable capability, equipment and experience.  As a result, the FAA negotiated a contract with BAE Systems. Both phases of the contract were successful and the FAA's requirement has expanded to include an immediate need for 8 additional antennae and the option to order 14 more between now and December 31, 2008.  The FAA believes that BAE is still the only manufacturer that can meet all the requirements above and expeditious delivery of the antennae.   If your company does not agree with this single source determination to modify the contract, please provide evidence of your requisite capabilities, equipment, actual experience and guaranteed delivery schedule for the FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Thursday, May 30, 2006.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

<DESC>Please note this will be an ITS BPA Small Business award. The Base Support Expeditionary (BaS&E) Planning Tool represents a new vision and roadmap associated with the capabilities contained in the LOGCAT suite. BaS&E reflects a fully migrated tool operating inside the GCSS-AF IF architecture. It retains the ability to centrally store military value collected data, collect the data, present the data via web browser and perform assessments against the data resulting in force beddown basing decisions. Additionally BaS&E integrates geospatial attributes and mapping features provided by GeoReach. The BaS&E tool suite will be deployed on both the unclassified and classified environments. It also moves away from client/server architecture towards a Net Centric environment that meets several of the Air Force system mandates such as; web enablement, Reduced Sign On (RSO), access via the Air Force Portal and operation on the Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) IF. The contractor will develop and deliver an updated product version that encompasses all Software Change Requirements (SCR) identified during development of version 1.0 thru version 2.0. Changes reflect opportunities not previously available when initial modules were developed but became available through process improvements and enhanced technical solutions. Including: develop master schedule, task completion metrics, monthly status reports, trip reports, technical presentations, minutes of Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs), baseline design reviews, artifacts identified in SEP tailoring worksheet, internal processes such as peer review sheets, minutes of internal requirements, design, code, and test reviews. Analysis of software problems reported to include a matrix that maps these problem reports to the software version where they are fixed and an analysis of test descriptions that should have prevented the problems if executed properly. Conduct on-going evaluations of the processes used in software development and the resulting software documentation will be available for government inspection.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation w!  ill contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather info!  rmation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the officia l version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply;  52.216-18 Ordering.

Thi s is a market survey to locate a source for production, testing and delivery of MELIOS spares; the Electronic, Optics and Laser Modules. NSNs 5860-01-324-2790, 5860-01-324-2791 and 5860-01-324-8206 respectively. CE-LCMC is looking for a (5 Year's) Indefini te Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to be awarded around November 2006. MELIOS:-(Description for information only); The Mini Eyesafe Laser Infrared Observation Set is a lightweight, individually operated,  hand-held or tripod-mounted laser rangefinder capable of determining ranges from 50 through 9995 meters in 5 meters increments and displaying the range in the eyepiece. Optics Module:-The Optics Module shall determine and display in the eyepiece the distance to a target with required minimum of 50 meters and maximum of 9995 meters,in 5 meters increments, by using the laser start pulse and the reflected laser stop pulse. T he optics Module shall exhibit no more than 1 failure out of any  100 consecutive rangings thereby determining the range to targets under the conditions that the emitter beam shall be parallel to the Optics Module Assembly optical axis,the emitter shall output 2 pulses, one for the start time, one for the stop time, and the emitter energy output shall correspond to the energy reflected  from a target 9990 meters distant. Laser Module:-The Laser Module consists of several components/assembly that receives high voltage from the Power Supply  Module (in the Electronic Module) and charges the storage capacitor, when the Charge Switch is pressed. The Pulse Forming Network(PFN) uses a capacitor to store energy during the Charge cycle. When the capacitor is fully charged, the ready indicator illumi nates. The laser, consisting of the flash lamp,laser rod,Q-switch assembly and partial mirror assembly, produces an output beam. This beam travels through the Output Collimating Telescope, which is made up of a corner cube prism,              telescope obj ective lenses, and the(visible light filter)output window. Electronics Module:- The Electronics Module consists of several modules/switches. The Power Supply Module,depending on the position of the Mode Switch, supplies; 5Vdc to the specified circuits in the Optics and Laser Modules. 12 Vdc to the Receiver Module circuits in the Optics Module. Switched 24 Vdc.High Voltage for the laser Module (700 to 850 Vdc.) The Mode Switch connects battery power to the Power Supply Modu le circuits.The Mode Switch has 4 positions: OFF, FIRST RTN, LAST RTN, TEST (PULL).With the Mode Switch in FIRST RTN or LAST RTN, the charge switch will initiate the charging of the PFN(Pulse Forming Network) capacitor in the Laser Module and, when the capacitor reaches the set voltage level,the ready  indicator will illuminate in the display to the left of the range digits.  Performance Specifications for all these 3 spares(Modules);MIL-O-49251, MIL-L-49250, and MIL-E-49252 respectively are available upon request. This is not a request for proposals. Interested suppliers must include vendor brochures which detail comprehensive /complete information on technical and critical performence characteristics.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED) of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA)  National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) in Duluth, Minnesota which has a requirement for a bench top liquid chromatograph-mass selective detector with a triple quadrupole mass analyzer (LC-MS-MS) system. ?	This instrument will be delivered to and assembled at the U.S.EPA NHEERL/MED-Duluth laboratory where it will remain and be used for toxicological research.  ?	The LC-MS-MS instrument system must be capable of analyzing automated on-line microdialysis samples utilizing a microbore capable HPLC system. Hardware and software connectivity between instrument components and microdialysis injection equipment is a critical element. The HPLC sub-system is to consist of gradient capable mixing pumps at low flow, Peltier cooled autosampler, solvent degasser, sample enrichment capabilities, diode array detector, fluoresence detector and be able to accept external start/stop signal from external sample injection loop.  ?	The system should be able to be configured to be very tolerant of dissolved high solids and salts with low maintenance. No loss of sensitivity during runs of up to 96 hours and 200 injections are required. If special cones, torches, lenses, shields, spray chambers, nebulizers...etc are required to meet this requirement the seller must include these items in duplicate for this acquisition. ?	The instrument system and cart must be mobile and be able to fit through the 40" wide doorways to allow for transport between labs. ?	Automatic system startup, shutdown and optimization and computer controlled instrument tuning for optimum performance. ?	The LC-MS-MS system must function from a single computer workstation. Connectivity between the MS-MS and HPLC must be complete as defined below: 1)  Bidirectional communication between the MS-MS and the HPLC components is essential. If any LC component fails or the MS-MS faults,  the system must not continue running and consuming samples scheduled to be analyzed. The total system should shut down or go into idle status without loss of previously injected sample data. Starting and stopping of system modules must be programmable events from the system software via the workstation. 2)  All data generated from the LC-MS-MS must be saved in the event of a fatal system fault, up to completion of the previously injected sample during a sequenced run. 3)  Real Time viewing of the LC-MS-MS data stream ( ie.  chromatogram) must be possible. Alternatively, the ability to view a current chromatogram at a moment during its generation is acceptable. 4)  The system must be capable of multi-tasking. During active LC-MS-MS operation and sample measurement it must be possible to process, view, reintegrate or transfer data files and view sequences previously saved. The data system must allow modification of the sequence being actively run to accommodate necessary changes in the sample scheduling.  5)  Two copies or licenses to use the software at other non-instrument workstations for data manipulation shall be provided. ?	System shall have CD ROM based presentations, delivered by application experts, on the following topics: Solution Chemistry, Sample Preparation, System Diagnostics, System Startup, De-convolution, System Calibration and LC/MS Fundamentals. These presentations are to include full video and audio features.      ?	System shall have on-line logbooks that provide date- and time-stamped records of runs, errors, and maintenance events.  ?	System shall allow for the creation of LC/MS spectral libraries. System shall allow for library searches based on both UV/VIS and mass spectral libraries. Installation: ?	System shall include installation, basic instrument overview, four day operator?s training course, a 1 year warranty, and a 1 year telephone support contract provided in the list price of the product.  A computer based training module and system maintenance procedures shall be provided on CD-ROM.  ?

Description

The Office of Policy and Research of the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor solicits a proposal for research projects focused on private employment-based health and pension benefits and plans, and related public policy issues.  For consideration, projects shall propose a budget of $25,000 or less, and a performance period of 12 months or less.  This is an unrestrictive solicitation.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541720.  Proposals shall describe new research that would be undertaken, and not work currently funded or completed.  Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of: policy relevance, study design and implementation, work plan and schedule of deliverables, qualifications and past performance of primary researcher, and proposed cost.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may permit extensions to the proposal submission date or that may otherwise modify this announcement.  Proposals received after Thursday, June 23, 2006, will not be considered under this solicitation.   Proposals shall be written.  Orders awarded will be firm-fixed price.


Introduction

Landmark employee benefits legislation enacted in 1974 gave the Federal government primary responsibility for protecting the rights of workers covered by private employee benefit plans.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 places oversight responsibilities at the Department of Labor (DOL) in the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).  Section 513 of Title I of ERISA directs and authorizes the Secretary of Labor to undertake research on employee benefit plans.  


SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS


Introduction

Landmark employee benefits legislation enacted in 1974 gave the Federal government primary responsibility for protecting the rights of workers covered by private employee benefit plans.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 places oversight responsibilities at the Department of Labor (DOL) in the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).  Section 513 of Title I of ERISA directs and authorizes the Secretary of Labor to undertake research on employee benefit plans.  





Statement of Work

DOL solicits proposals for research projects focused on private employment-based health and pension benefits and plans, and related public policy issues.  For consideration, projects shall propose a budget of $25,000 or less, and a performance period of 12 months or less.  It is the intention of the DOL to make up to four awards under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  With these constraints, this solicitation seeks to attract the interest of academic researchers who may be in the process of completing a dissertation or in the early stages of establishing an academic career.  The funds made available with the solicitation could fund work conducted by the primary researcher or support research assistance related to the primary researcher’s project.  Proposals shall describe new research that would be undertaken, and not work currently funded or completed.  Projects shall not involve primary data collection.  

Employee benefits policy issues and research projects of particular interest would include, although not exhaustively:

1.	Employers’ and workers’ access to affordable health benefits coverage, and the nature and quality of such coverage, including the effects of:

•	Proposals affecting health insurance market structure and regulation;
•	Tax preferences for health insurance purchased in group and individual markets; 
•	Consumer-driven choices of health plans or providers, including health savings accounts;
•	Effect on health costs of quality reporting  (including efficiency and effectiveness measures);
•	Relationship of  health costs to state benefit mandates; relationship of health costs to state proportion of aging population; and
•	Efficiency and effectiveness initiatives in other countries and their effect on the health marketplace.



2.	Workers’ strategies to ensure retirement security, including the causes and effects of:

•	Individual account participant contributions, investments and distributions (e.g., lump-sum or annuitized payments);
•	Role of professional financial advice and investment education;
•	Automatic enrollment  provisions to improve participation rates and retirement income (e.g., auto-rebalancing, auto-escalation, auto-rollover, and other techniques);
•	Competing saving priorities, e.g., retirement income needs, healthcare and long-term care costs, and near-term education and housing costs;
•	Transitional employment or phased retirement; and
•	Management of longevity risk by exploring alternative payout strategies (e.g., life annuity and phased withdrawal). 

3.	Determinants of employers’ decision to offer, freeze, amend or terminate employee health and pension plans, including:

•	Applicable federal laws,  regulations, and programs, including recent and proposed changes to such laws,  regulations, and programs;
•	Motives prompting some plan sponsors to freeze defined benefit pension plans and the effect on participants and public policy implications;
•	Demographic and economic trends, including labor, capital and healthcare market trends;
•	Healthcare cost increases, drivers and control efforts;
•	Pension plan financial risks, including strategies for management of funding/investment risk; 
•	Pension and health care legacy costs; and 
•	Role of global competition.

4.	Developments in financial markets and instruments and corporate finance, and the implications for defined contribution accounts and defined benefit funds, including issues related to:

	&#9679;    Plan fees and transaction costs; 
•	Accounting standards reform for ERISA plans; and
•	Alternative trading systems (ATS), automated quotation systems (AQS) and electronic communications networks (ECNs).

Employee benefits research projects could be based on population or employer (i.e., plan-sponsor) databases.  Frequently applied secondary databases of both types are briefly described below:

Population Databases.  Several federally funded household surveys are used to study employee benefits.  Relevant surveys include:  employee benefit modules of the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP); employee benefit supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS); the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Household Component (MEPS-HC); the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF); the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS); and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The 2001 SIPP included two employee benefit modules:  a module on employment-based health coverage conducted in 2002 and released in 2004; and a module on pension coverage status of workers and pension benefit amounts paid to retirees, which was conducted in 2004 and released in 2005.  Supplements to the CPS that provide employee benefit information include the April 1993 supplement, the September 1994 supplement, the contingent worker supplements fielded in February of 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001, and the annual March income supplement.  The contingent worker supplement to the CPS was not fielded in February 2003.  (The Appendix describes how to obtain further information on these surveys.)

Employer Databases.  Some projects lend themselves to investigation with the use of employer or plan-sponsor databases.  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) collects information on employer-sponsored health plans.  Form 5500 Annual Report files, which are jointly produced by Treasury, PBGC and EBSA, are publicly available.  Employer studies might also rely on proprietary data collected from a group of employers (or intermediaries) sharing characteristics of interest.  If confidentiality with respect to the identity of these employers is required, assurances of appropriate protection measures must be provided at the time of submission of the proposal.  (The Appendix also describes how to obtain further information on Form 5500 files.)


Procedures for Submission

Deadline.  Proposals received after Friday, June 23, 2006, will not be considered under this solicitation.      

Proposals.  Proposal submissions shall consist of a maximum of 10 double-spaced pages providing the information listed below.  Submissions shall also include a vita for the primary researcher and a budget.  (NOTE:  Projects shall not involve primary data collection.)  

Proposal submissions shall contain the following information:

1.	Name, telephone number and address of primary researcher;
2.	Name, telephone number, address, and social security number or employer identification number (EIN) of party to whom payment for purchase order should be made;
3.	Title;
4.	Abstract of a 100 words or less;

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to an existing award with the University of Rhode Island for a requirement to evaluate the feasibility of the use of a turtle excluder device (TED) in the scallop trawl fishery in the Mid-Atlantic.  NEFSC seeks to ensure continuity of the data and consistent application of the same research methodologies in an effort to compare, contrast, and test the validity of the data collected from both research efforts. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  This project seeks to test an already developed design for its utility in a commercial application using commercial vessels.  The proposed requirement is an expansion of bycatch reduction technology (BRT) work already being conducted under purchase order number EA133F-05-SE-6561 with the University of Rhode Island and, as such, will be conducted in a similar region with similar protocols.  The objectives of the research are:  To compare in-shell scallop catch and bycatch of a TED equipped scallop trawl with a control net; To compare in-shell scallop catch and bycatch of a TED equipped flounder trawl with a control net; To determine if TED equipped trawls are size selective for scallops.  The Contractor shall conduct paired comparisons on twin rigged scallop trawl vessels with TED equipped trawls compared with naked net controls for scallop retention, bycatch reduction, and scallop size selectivity.  The Contractor shall be required to provide the vessels and operating crews for the research effort.  Three General Category scallop trawl vessels shall be contracted to conduct all sea trials.  Two vessels will be equipped with traditional scallop trawls, while one vessel will be equipped with flounder trawls.  Each vessel will fish for 12 days and complete a minimum of 30 comparative tows.  The Contractor must be trained in fishing vessel safety procedures and will follow Standard Northeast Fisheries Observer Program (NEFOP) protocols during all data collections.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by June 1, 2006.  A specification is not available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) with Req No. 1010487 to provide expert services for risk/benefit evaluation of seafood relating to Methylmercury in commercial fish.  This acquisition is set-aside for competition restricted to small business concerns and will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The requirements for this project are as follows:  Project Title:   Request Expert Services for Risk/Benefit Evaluation of Seafood Relating to Methylmercury in Commercial Fish.  Objective:  To perform risk/benefit evaluation(s) of commercial seafood that focus on the risk of methylmercury as weighed against nutritional and other health benefits, and provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration in light of the latest scientific, technical, and economic data and information.  These options will be made for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration about actions to be taken, if any, on the basis of this analysis and discussions and input from all stakeholders, giving due consideration to FDA’s broad responsibilities under the FD&C and PHS Acts.   Background:   Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that can have pronounced adverse effects in humans at very high doses.  These effects have been seen in extreme poisoning events as a result of industrial spills in Japan and Iraq.  In the United States, the primary exposure to methylmercury is generally regarded to be through the consumption of fish. Almost all fish have at least trace amounts of methylmercury.  Historically, the public health questions surrounding methylmercury have involved determining exposure through fish consumption over time that would be necessary to cause an adverse effect.  The degree of exposure is dependent on both the type and amount of fish consumed.  Public health actions, both in the United States and elsewhere, have focused on the development of “tolerable daily intake” levels for human exposure, regulatory limits, e.g., “action levels,” for the amount of methylmercury that would be allowed in fish, and consumer advisories recommending upper limits on fish consumption both in terms of amounts and types.  Fish have always been considered a good source of nutrition, but more recently, questions have been raised about potential health consequences of not consuming, or substantially limiting the consumption of, seafood.  Many of these questions derive from data about the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish and other potentially positive nutritional characteristics of fish.  The recently revised consumer advisory on methylmercury emphasized the benefits of consuming fish but did not involve either a quantitative or qualitative assessment of the risks from mercury exposure versus the benefits of eating fish.  Scope of Work:  In cooperation with the Office of Seafood, and with the assistance of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, the Chief Medical Officer, FDA staff, EPA, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders, as needed, the contractor shall:  1.  Conduct a new risk evaluation that takes into account all data and all previous assessments including the recent assessment by JECFA.  2.  Conduct a benefits evaluation of seafood in the diet that includes but is not necessarily limited to:  literature search, and analysis to the extent practicable of known and potential nutritional and other health benefits from seafood consumption and estimates of lost benefits and/or public health harm from dietary changes in seafood consumption, if any.    3.  Risk and benefit papers will be peer – reviewed under FDA auspices consistent with guidelines to meet FDA and OMB requirements.  4.  Coordinate contract work with the NAS/IOM Study on “Nutrient Relationships in Seafood: Selections to Balance Benefits and Risks” – participating in public meetings, make available the peer – reviewed Risk and Benefit papers and any modeling tools developed to the study.  5.  Provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, to FDA for changes, if any, on the basis of the above evaluation(s).  Among other things, these options may relate to the consumer advisory, the action level, and consumer education.  6.  Conduct meetings with “stakeholders” in other Federal agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, industry, academia/scientific community, etc. on the purposes and scope of the work, the work itself, and gain their views and understanding.  7.  Conduct at least two public meetings, announced in the Federal Register, and conducted to share new data and information and to obtain oral and/or written input.  One or more of these public meetings may be held with NAS.  8.  Meet with agency, HHS, and other federal agency representatives on a regular basis to discuss the status of the project.  9.  Prepare briefing materials and provide support to the agency as needed.  10.  Provide advice associated with consumer studies by participation in the Technical Advisory Group. There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates. Support to be Provided by FDA:   adequate scientific technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, etc.; adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract.  Scientific technical support may be augmented by staff from EPA and other government agencies, where appropriate.  Period of performance is one year from date of award.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  It is anticipated that a purchase order will be awarded.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  The anticipated release date of the RFQ is on or about June 6, 2006.  The firm date and time for receipt of offers will be stated in the RFQ.  Only written responses will be accepted.  Questions may be sent by e-mail to Lorena.Forgosh@fda.hhs.gov or Gina.Jackson@fda.hhs.gov; or by fax at 301-827-7106.  The RFQ will be made available electronically at this website.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the RFQ and any amendments.

<DESC>****THIS IS SET ASIDE FOR PRIME 8A CONTRACTORS.


It is highly encouraged that 8(a) firms create either; a MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ relationship, JOINT VENTURE relationship, or a TEAMING PARTNERSHIP relationship through subcontracting efforts with either large or small business(s).  These teaming arrangements shall be evaluated as outlined in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a suggestion from the government and not a directive; therefore it shall be totally the 8(a) firm(s) to decide what the best opportunity will be for its’ company to achieve the requirements set forth in the (RFP).  The Department intends to award one contract from this announcement to an 8(a) contractor who best meets or exceed the requirements established in the attached request for proposal, award fee plan and award term plan.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost and/or price and technical standpoint.

This announcement is the follow up to a sources sought synopsis posted Aug 26, 2005, and it’s modification to synopsis dated; Sep 9, 2005; the solicitation number is SAQMPD05I1006.  This announcement super-cedes both.

The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to install automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include but not limited to program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to (GFS) Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the (GFS) Charleston, but support services will be needed by other (RM) Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area (RM) Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel, all travel will be handled through task orders.  
 
Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé program, Joint Venture Agreements and Teaming Partnerships with subcontractors’ relationships shall be reviewed as acceptable or non-acceptable in accordance with Small Business Administration’s regulations concerning these specific teaming arrangements.  


Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this (RFP) and site visit travel to the Pre-Performance Conference.  The Pre-Proposal Conference/site visit is scheduled to be held June 13th, 2006 at 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), at the Global Financial Services, Charleston, SC 29415-5008 as outlined in the RFP.  All Offerors who anticipate on attending the Pre-Proposal Conference must e-mail three (3) names as a maximum, to Mr. Pete Jones’s e-mail address provided in the last paragraph of this announcement.

All questions concerning the (RFP) shall be received on or before June 23rd, 2006.  Any questions received after that date shall be returned unanswered and shall not be considered.  Please submit your proposal as described in Section “L” of the (RFP) no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, July 18th, 2006, to: JonesPW@state.gov. Please submit all questions to Mr. Pete Jones via email related to this RFP. No telephone call questions shall be entertained. Point of Contact: Mr. Pete Jones, Contract Officer/Specialist 703-875-6273.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a five-year (three years with one two-year extension option) reimbursable contract to establish an Innovations Clearinghouse that will be a database-driven, Internet-accessible, public clearinghouse of innovations in health service delivery. The Innovations Clearinghouse will facilitate collection of innovative health service practices and present them in a standardized format accompanied by expert commentary; promote their dissemination, replication, adaptation, and use; and, foster innovation in the U.S. health care service industry. 

Tasks will revolve around the development, deployment and maintenance of the processes and systems to collect, publish, update and archive innovations (in health service delivery), associated tools and lessons learned. The innovations will be entered and stored in a Contractor-constructed database; they will be posted to a Web site the Contractor will design, deploy and maintain for this project. Related tasks include establishment of an expert panel and an editorial board, development of criteria that innovative health service delivery practices must meet to be included in the Clearinghouse, and creation of a standardized template to capture innovations’ attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouse on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of the inclusion criteria and standardized template. The Web site will be user-centered and will meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department-wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using an approved domain, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records. In addition, online and offline opportunities for learning and networking among Innovations Clearinghouse users will be a component of this project. AHRQ’s QualityTools database and Web site (www.qualitytools.ahrq.gov) will become the responsibility of the Innovations Clearinghouse Contractor.  Eventually, the QualityTools database will be presented through the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site. 

Offerors must possess expertise in health service delivery innovation and change; implementation of evidence-based health practices; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategy implementation and evaluation; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, working with expert panels and editorial boards. To evaluate the Offeror’s expertise in the aforementioned areas, the information on the process to perform the work described below must be included in the proposal.  1.  Maintain AHRQ’s QualityTools database and Web site.  2. Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change.  3. Develop and apply inclusion criteria related to health service delivery innovations.  4. Develop an innovations database template record; Stimulate, assist in generating, and collect a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 6.  Stimulate, assist in generating, and collecting a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 7.  Design the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site incorporating feedback provided on the existing QualityTools Web site, and develop, test, deploy, maintain, and evaluate this national Web-based repository of health care system and practice innovations, change initiatives, change packages, and associated tools and lessons learned; import QualityTools’ Web crawler feature with a redesigned interface to assist users in finding relevant innovations, change initiatives, packages and tools at specific, complementary Web sites for ‘one stop’ searching (or suggest an alternative Web crawler accompanied by rationale). 7. Emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality. 8.  Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users; and 9.  Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site 

The Innovations Clearinghouse is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as operationalizing health service delivery innovation and change; implementing and evaluating health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategies; educating and training adult professionals; evaluating and implementing evidence-based clinical information; constructing large relational databases; developing clinically-related classification schemes; and developing Web sites. A PMI-certified or PMI-certification eligible Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the Innovations Clearinghouse core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the Innovations Clearinghouse is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.    

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ’s homepage go to “Funding Opportunities”, then to “Contracts”, and then to “Request for Proposal (RFP)”. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about May 19, 2006 with proposals due July 25, 2006.

<SOLNBR>DTFACT-04-C-00017
<RESPDATE>053006
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609-485-4380
<DESC>Amendment:  Closing date and time for responses is corrected to read:  "All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than 2 p.m., local time, on Tuesday, May 30, 2006." The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Ground Facility (LGF) requires valid ranging source error estimates for all Global Positioning Service (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) satellites in view within a specified reception area.  Error estimates from a prototype LGF have been provided to the LAAS specification team in order to validate of the requirements of the specification using a dual-port L1 only antenna design.  While the dual-port design is effective, it requires additional receiver hardware.   A simpler broadband (L1/L2/L5) single-port design with reduced siting constraints would benefit the LAAS program by reducing the complexity of the validation prototype.  A review of the literature shows a number of antennae that have been proposed and built with these design goals, but, to date, none have proven feasible.  BAE Systems has independently researched and developed an antenna design that potentially will provide reception on multiple frequencies, with a large desired to undesired ratio reception pattern and low-error GPS measurements.  If the design concept proves successful, LTP data collection and operational capabilities will be greatly expanded.      On June 25, 2005, the FAA issued a public announcement for a prototype antenna that could: â€¢	Be capable of receiving GPS signals on L1, L5, and L2 within the reception mask specified in FAA-E-2937A. â€¢	Provide the received signals on a single antenna port for all elevations between 5 and 90 degrees. â€¢	Provide a desired to undesired amplitude ratio for single reflection ground-induced multipath of at least 30dB for elevation angles between 5 and 35 degrees. â€¢	Provide an omni-directional azimuth gain pattern, ?1dB, as a function of elevation. â€¢	Provide the signals without any azimuth dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding ?1cm. â€¢	Provide the signals without any elevation dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding ?1cm. â€¢	Provide the signals utilizing multiple right-hand circularly polarized antenna elements. Technical Approach:  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, assembly and demonstration shall be conducted in two separate phases.  The first phase is assembly and proof of the basic properties of the reception element.  The second optional phase will include assembly and testing of a complete prototype antenna array.   Performance verification shall consist of controlled laboratory tests, antenna test range measurements, and reception of the live GPS SPS constellation.  The FAA will conduct validation testing. The contractor must have in in-depth understanding and expertise in antenna design and manufacturing and be fully cognizant of FAA's research and development activities and objectives for this type of equipment.  In addition, the contractor must have access to resources and facilities to perform all research tasks. At that time, BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Inc. (BAE) was determined to be the only source with the requisite design and technical capabilities.  No other companies submitted a response demonstrating comparable capability, equipment and experience.  As a result, the FAA negotiated a contract with BAE Systems. Both phases of the contract were successful and the FAA's requirement has expanded to include an immediate need for 8 additional antennae and the option to order 14 more between now and December 31, 2008.  The FAA believes that BAE is still the only manufacturer that can meet all the requirements above and expeditious delivery of the antennae.   If your company does not agree with this single source determination to modify the contract, please provide evidence of your requisite capabilities, equipment, actual experience and guaranteed delivery schedule for the FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Thursday, May 30, 2006.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.
Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 

Draft RFP Release	August 06
Industry Day		September 06
RFP Release		October 06
Contract Award	May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATD’s are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).  

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, suprt equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.  Simulator support
2.  Courseware support
3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.  Software certification level
5.  Undergraduate/graduate flying training

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.

Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATD’s are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).  

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Index (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.  Simulator support
2.  Courseware support
3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.  Software certification level
5.  Undergraduate/graduate flying training

All  responses to this document are requested NLT 5 July 2004. _________________________________________________ The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to  perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS)  Contractor Logistics Support  (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 Jan  2007. BACKGROUND GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon  Aircraft Corporation as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS  CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The  GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the  maximum student and instructor training load at each training site The GBTS has  three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and  the Training Integration Management System (TIMS). There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training  operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students  normal and emergency procedures as defined in the JPPT syllabus.  All three  utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full  functioning replica of the T-6A front seat cockpit and the same Instructor  Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC  computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing  system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the  devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device  (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33  degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06
	2.  Questions from Contractor	s				25 April – 12 May 06
3.  Response to Questions					16 May 06
	4.  Industry Responses due 					23 May 06
5.  Issuance of Request for Proposal (approximately)	30 Jun 06
	6.  Proposal Due Date	(approximately)			31 Jul 06

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted. Request you read this synopsis in its entirety to include the attachments prior to providing your response.  Final responses to this synopsis are due no later than 23 May 06.  Your response should demonstrate capabilities, expertise, and past performance and include answers to the below questions. 
  
Interested parties should submit the following:

	1.  A cover letter (max 1 page) that identifies:

a.	Your CAGE Code
b.	Company name, Physical address, Webpage URL, Point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  
c.	Please indicate your company’s business category, e.g.; large or small based on the NAICS code 541380 size standard ($11 million).  If your company is a Small business please also indicate small business category.
d.	The letter shall address any known Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) and the ability to mitigate possible future OCI risks.
.
2.	A softcopy capabilities briefing in MS office format (Power Point or Word), which

Word).  Your response to each question is limited to one page.


Q1.  Based on the data provided, are you interested in this requirement?   

Q2.  On an effort of this magnitude, is there any part of this strategy that would preclude your company from participating in a full and open competition?  If so, please explain.  

Q3. Previous market research indicates that that no one (1) laboratory can provide all of the required testing services and that only large businesses have the required capabilities to provide services for a majority of required tests.  Based on similar commercial efforts and previous experience under other firm-fixed priced efforts, would you support this conclusion?  

Q4.  Would you consider teaming arrangements with other laboratories in order to meet all requirements of the attached PWS?  If not, please explain.  Provide a detailed explanation regarding your approach for establishing a teaming arrangement and demonstrate how this arrangement will fulfill the requirements of the PWS.  

Q5.  Do you have any comments with respect to any of the acquisition strategies being contemplated? (GSA BPA(s), competitive, a competitive commercial BPA, or full and open competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ(s)).

Q6. Given the data provided, would your company have reservations in proposing a firm-pricing pricelist for all tests.  If not, explain.  

Q7.  Do you have any comments with respect to evaluation criteria we are contemplating?  What are the critical evaluation criteria that would distinguish one contractor’s capabilities from another?  Explain.

Q8. Does your company have a GSA contract that can meet all the testing requirements for this procurement?  Is so, please provide the appropriate documentation that shows a cross reference for meeting all the requirements of the attached PWS including all sample testing.

Please review the following draft attachments for this requirement.

<DESC>Notice to Vendors:  The release of the solicitation has been delayed.  The estimated release date is now 1 - 15 August 2006************************************************************

The United States Department of State will release the above referenced solicitation in approximately 60 days from todays date.  If interested, respond by e-mail to PowellHL@State.Gov.
No advance information will be provided prior to the release of the solicitation.

The scope of this requirement is for a complete range of support to the management, operations, and WRAPS application software development, delivery, deployment and maintenance of the Refugee Processing Center (RPC) in Rosslyn, Virginia and the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS).

The objective of this Task Order is to accomplish all the activities associated with providing the aforementioned support while employing industry best practices in project management and software development, including risk mitigation to ensure on-time delivery within budget and innovative techniques to minimize costs.

The challenge is supporting and maintaining WRAPS as an operational system so that there is minimal or no disruption in the timely processing of refugees, and at the same time allowing for the planned addition of features and functionality as well as responding to field-driven changes.

Rather than focus on simple operations and maintenance, DoS seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus that provides highly effective, secure, and reliable computing and processing resources.  The winning contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve PRM’s mission performance and reduce program costs.  DoS places special emphasis on the contractor’s ability to proactively offer innovative solutions and look for ways to reduce the total life-cycle cost for WRAPS and the RPC, so that the savings realized from the program can be applied to benefit the processing of an even greater number of refugees.  DoS is anticipating a best-value procurement emphasizing a stable cost environment with a potential term of 5 years.

2 Gb Memory
4x36 Gb UltraSCSI Disk Drives (10,000RPM)
Software 9 Operating system

<DESC>Request for Information/Comments on Draft Financial Management Line of Business (FMLOB) Migration Planning Guidance 

NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL BE ANSWERED BY PHONE. SUBMIT ALL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO fsio@gsa.gov. 

Written comments are due by close of business June 12, 2006 by email to fsio@gsa.gov.   


This is not a solicitation, but a request for information for industry and agencies’ comment on the draft Migration Planning Guidance.  Responses to this notice are requested to be concise comments directed specifically to the draft guidance mentioned below:

The Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO), formerly JFMIP, is seeking comments on an exposure draft for the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) Migration Planning Guidance provided in the web link below.  The FMLoB is one of the President’s management initiatives to significantly improve financial management in the government.  The goal of the FMLoB is to improve the cost, quality, and performance of financial management systems by leveraging shared service solutions and implementing government-wide reforms that foster efficiencies in federal financial systems and operations.  Based on this guidance, Federal agencies will need to evaluate costs, benefits, and risks of the various alternatives for supporting financial management systems and operations.  Federal and commercial shared service providers may provide viable alternatives to an agency in-house solution to better manage the risk, performance, and cost of implementing and operating financial systems.  

The draft Migration Planning Guidance provides agencies with guidance and tools to consider various shared service options.  Specific directions are provided to agencies for conducting a competitive process for migrating to a shared service provider. It also answers questions on Federal and commercial shared service providers (SSP).  The guidance provides tools and templates, that agencies can use in the selection of, migration to, and management of operating agreements with a SSP, and in comparing SSC as alternatives to an in-house financial system operations.

The draft FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance can befound at www.fsio.gov. Comments should be submitted on the Comment Tracking Sheet found at http://www.fsio.gov.  Written comments are due by close of business June 12, 2006 by email to fsio@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The NMFS intends to award sole source contract for a base plus three (3) option years to Dr. Edward Philips on the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences at the University of Florida to (1) produce a palatable pelletized fish feed of measurable concentration of the toxin, microcystin, from laboratory cultures of the toxic alga Microcystis aeruginosa for laboratory experiments with small fish, (2) supply Microcystis aeruginosa, microtoxin, and the pelletized feed for exposure experiments with small fish being conducted by NOAA Fisheries, and (3) determine the influence of salinity on the growth and survival of Microcystis aeruginosa, as well as the production, distribution, and fate of its associated toxin microcystin.   This is part of a longterm study by NOAA, NMFS, of the prevalence of abnormalities in fish of the St. Lucie Estuarine System, Florida. One objective of the study is to determine the factors causing the abnormalities. Blooms of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa appear episodically in the St. Lucie system and are swept downstream with river outflow. Microcystis aeruginosa is introduced into the St. Lucie system via freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee. Part A. Provision of Microcystis aeruginosa and extracts of microtoxin and formulation, production, and provision of a pelletized fish feed containing microcystin for use in laboratory exposure experiments with small fish. Microcystis aeruginosa and extracts of microcystin will be provided to NOAA/NMFS  for exposure experiments with small fish.  These will be for pilot experiments that use small quantities of the alga and its toxin, either in closed systems or in experiments with periodic spiking.  A palatable pelletized feed will be developed that would be readily accepted and taken up by small fish, would hold together and so not cloud the water in the exposure chamber, and would contain a consistent concentration of microcystin throughout so that a given quantity of feed would provide a consistent dose of the toxin.  The palletized feed will be provided to NOAA/NMFS for exposure experiments with fish. Part A. Salinity effects on growth, survival and toxin distribution by Microcystis aeruginosa. Part B.  Microcystis aeruginosa and its toxin microcystin will be exposed to a series of increasing concentrations of salt water mixed with fresh water in experiments that will determine: 1.Growth and toxic production potential under differing salinities.2. Algal survivability and release of toxin to the water column under differing salinities. The experiments will be conducted with algal strains resident to Lake Okeechobee and found in the St. Lucie River, and the water used for the experiments will be from the St. Lucie River and the Atlantic Ocean immediately adjacent to the St. Lucie River system. This is an on going study. During the option years, if exercised, the contractor shall repeat the tasks performed during the base period. The Government only knows of one source, Dr. Edward Philips in the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences at the University of Florida who has the expertise, experience, and knowledge to do the work.  The focus of his research has been the biology, ecology, and management of algae and aquatic microorganism since 1983. He has recently completed a 7-year study of Lake Okeechobee, the source of Microcystis aeruginosa to the St. Lucie systems. He maintains cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa and extracts the toxin routinely. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to perform the work described; name and telephone number from references or firms that you previously provided the services described herein, and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above. Based on the response the Government will determine whether competition is feasible.
All responses to this notice can be fax to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker or emailed to sharon.walker@noaa.gov.

<DESC>Research Opportunity Description: This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). The Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR) is seeking innovative technology concepts to reduce Unmanned Air System (UAS) operator workload. This technology will help operators to better manage and control multiple dissimilar Navy unmanned aerial vehicles and its associated payloads. Various studies and assessments of UAS operator activities have determined that effective control of multiple unmanned vehicles taxes an individual’s visual, audio, and cognitive skills.  The technology should have the capacity to provide a more agile, flexible, responsive, and robust capability to simplify control and improve an operator’s situational awareness during UAS and multiple simultaneous UAS missions with dissimilar air vehicles.  

The objectives of this RFI are to:  
1.	Identify technologies that are sound, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing and developing UAS(s).
2.	Refine identified technologies so that they better support Navy UAS(s) and its intended missions.
3.	Demonstrate that the technologies will reduce operator workload during execution of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) mission planning and re-tasking, UAV and payload Command, Control and Situational Awareness tasks, and data processing tasks including data retrieval, storage, manipulation, interpretation, and dissemination.
4.	Provide methods and technologies to increase the quantity of UAVs under simultaneous control from two to as many as eight. 

NAVAIR is issuing this RFI to allow industry an opportunity to submit its best technology concepts for review and consideration. 

Workload reduction designs should be at a Technological Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or higher based on the following scale:

TRL 1 		Basic principles observed and reported
TRL 2 		Technology concept and/or application formulated
TRL 3 	Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept
TRL 4 		Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment
TRL 5 		Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment
TRL 6 		System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant
Environment (ground or space)
TRL 7 		System prototype demonstration in a space environment
TRL 8 	Actual system completed and “flight qualified” through test and demonstration (ground or space)
TRL 9 		Actual system “flight proven” through successful mission operations

A proposed solution must be modular software able to integrate into the Tactical Control System (TCS) software architecture. Additional areas to be considered as factors are: improved mission effectiveness, advanced input and display devices, and increased performance. This list is by no means exhaustive and additional areas are both expected and solicited. Responses must address Navy and Marine Corps requirements for warfighting (i.e., technologies must show military utility/mission payoff and reflect the unique nature of the naval service). Technologies must be capable of demonstration and be able to transition to the respective Service Acquisition sponsors for final development prior to procurement and fielding.  

NAVAIR is soliciting ideas that are both revolutionary and affordable.  Revolutionary in the sense that a new technology radically improves UAS operator performance and situational awareness.  Affordable in the sense that implementation costs are reasonable and a possible net decrease in logistics support costs is realized.

SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION

Content and Format of White Papers:

White paper responses should not exceed 5 pages in length and must use the following format: (1) title, (2) Navy and/or Marine Corps warfighting payoff, (3) objective, (4) targeted end user community (i.e., aviation, ship operation, ground maneuver forces, ammunition handlers, construction forces, etc.), (5) technical approach, (6) technology or product (include picture, if possible), (7) risk(s), and (8) estimated cost and duration.

<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), through the General Acquisitions Branch (GAB), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 12  month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Update Software Summertown Pavilion, Middle Way, Oxford, OX2 7LG United Kingdom.   The anticipated date of award is 5/08//2006.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is committed to advancing a Science to Service Initiative.  The initiative reflects a systematic agency-wide effort to facilitate implementation of effective, evidence-based interventions to prevent and/or treat mental and addictive disorders, and to promote opportunities and feedback from the services communities to influence and frame future mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment research.  As part of this initiative, SAMHSA seeks to develop a range of tools that will facilitate evidence-based decision-making among individuals and organizations responsible for preventing and/or treating mental and substance use disorders.  One important tool - and the purpose of this contract - is the development of effectiveness summaries of evidence-based research in mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment that are practical, clinically relevant and accessible to agency stakeholders.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks:
The Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities.  

Initial and Subsequent Conference Calls with PO
Within 1 week of contract award, the contractor shall participate in a conference call meeting with the Project Officer (PO) and other relevant SAMHSA staff to discuss the requirements and deliverables of the contract.  Prior to this conference call, the PO shall provide background materials and other relevant documents on SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative, the new NREPP system, and related activities.  Within one week of the conference call, the contractor shall produce a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) memorandum outlining activities and action steps that will result in the development of a set of effectiveness summaries of evidence-based behavioral health interventions.  The contractor shall also participate in biweekly conference calls with the PO to discuss the status of project activities, and resolve any outstanding	issues.

Identification of Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) and Convening of TAP Meeting
Within three weeks of contract award, the contractor shall identify potential candidates to participate in a technical advisory panel (TAP) that will provide technical suggestions and feedback to the PO on the proposed contract deliverables.  Upon PO review and approval of the candidate list, the contractor shall contact and secure the participation of approved candidates.  Within ten weeks of contract award, the contractor shall convene TAP members for a two-day in-person meeting in the Washington D.C. area (most likely at SAMHSA headquarters),
to review and discuss proposed contract deliverables.  Within two weeks of the TAP meeting, Update Software shall provide the PO with a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) memorandum outlining activities and action steps emerging from the TAP meeting.

For budget purposes, the contractor should understand that they will not be responsible for travel, lodging, and honorarium expenses for TAP members participating in the meeting,
and that this will be covered under a separate and existing SAMHSA logistics contract.  However, the contractor should also understand that they will be responsible for the travel of
their own staff to participate in this meeting

Develop Taxonomies and Identify Search Strategies for Review by the TAP
Within seven weeks of contract award, shall develop a series of taxonomies (e.g., type of disorder, type of service setting, etc.) that will be used in categorizing contract deliverables.  In addition, the contractor shall also identify a range/continuum of electronic	search strategies to capture relevant systematic reviews and other evidence-based research.  The taxonomies and search strategies shall be presented to and discussed with the PO at least two weeks prior to the TAP meeting.  Subsequent to this discussion, the taxonomies and search strategies shall be distributed to the TAP members at least one week prior to the TAP meeting.

Monitor and Oversee Production of Draft Effectiveness Summaries
Within 36 weeks of contract award, and based upon the materials and decisions emerging from Tasks 2 and 3, the contractor shall monitor and oversee the production of draft effectiveness
summaries of evidence-based behavioral health interventions to prevent and/or treat mental and substance use disorders.  The behavioral health interventions that are the topic of the draft
effectiveness summaries shall be classified for effectiveness based upon the strength of the existing and reviewed evidence.  For budget purposes, the contractor should anticipate production of approximately 400 effectiveness summaries.

STATEMENT OF WORK:SECTION C  - SATETMENT OF WORK

Provision of Technical Assistance (TA) for Community Planning Groups and State and Territorial Health Departments and Their Grantees Using Volunteer Behavioral Scientists.

The statement of work for this proposal consists of 5 separate, but related, activities:

A.	Recruitment of volunteer scientists through national organizations for behavioral scientists (psychologists, social workers, anthropologists, epidemiologists, etc.) and by other appropriate strategies to maintain a cadre of at least 200 scientist volunteers and to meet any TA needs identified by needs assessments with health departments,CBOs, CPGs, or CDC.

B.	Orientation and Training of behavioral and social scientists to CDC’s HIV prevention efforts and issues involved in establishing successful working relationships with CBOs, health departments, CPGs, and other partners working with people living with HIV (PLWH).  The successful program shall ensure that all of its volunteers and other audiences identified by CDC are trained in the following areas:

1.	The organization, mission, and constituents of CDC
2.	CDC’s technology transfer activities
3.	HIV prevention community planning groups
4.	Evaluation and other assessment activities that support and sustain local use of science-based HIV prevention interventions.

In addition, for select volunteers, the program shall provide one advanced training activity.  These advanced training activities shall address advanced program evaluation topics, and each shall serve as a coaches’ training related to an intervention offered through the DEBI program (at least one of which shall be an intervention for PLWH).

C.	Linkage of behavioral scientist volunteers with prevention program planners and implementers (including CBOs, CPGs, health departments, and medical and social service providers) in their local communities in collaboration with local health departments, other national technical assistance provider organizations, the DEBI training Coordination Center contractor (which manages training for the DEBI program), and key CDC personnel from DHAP.  Linkages will be established to provide community based organizations and health departments with TA related to needs assessment, program planning, evidence-based interventions, program evaluation, training, technical support, and formative research.  Linkages will be established in one of three ways:

1.  Agencies will request technical assistance by accessing the  Capacity Building Branch (CBB) CBA Request and Information System (CRIS) web site, by contacting BSSV Program Director who will initiate the request via CRIS, or by contacting their state or territorial health department, or CDC project officer who will initiate the request via CRIS.
2.  The contractor shall conduct technical assistance needs assessments with AIDS program representatives of at least 75% of the state and territorial health departments to determine the needs of the health department-funded grantees and then secure volunteers to meet the identified needs.
3. The contractor shall ensure that at least 75% of community planning groups have representation (either as a voting member or an advisor) from a behavioral scientist.

D.   Retention of volunteers so that the cohort of active volunteers remains at or above 200 throughout the length of the contract.  Retention shall be ensured by

1. Using an advisory group of diverse volunteers to provide direction for the program.
2. Encouraging veteran volunteers to mentor newly recruited volunteers.
3. Maintaining a listserve and/or Web site to keep volunteers up-to-date on issues of importance to the program and/or its volunteers.

E. Reporting of TA provided by volunteers by using a system in which volunteers are able to report regularly and accurately the time spent on HIV prevention TA activities and the specific task accomplished.  In addition, all completed linkages should be followed up with an evaluation of the linkage from the perspective of the volunteer and the TA recipient.

	Tasks to be Performed by the Contractor

For this task order modification, the contractor shall perform the tasks specified below.  The technical monitor will provide guidance and information to the contractor regarding the requirements of this task order, and the contractor shall comply with the directions from the technical monitor.   The contractor shall ensure

A.	Recruitment of Volunteers

The contractor shall recruit volunteers through at least three professional organizations to ensure maintenance of a cadre of at least 200 volunteers.  Volunteers shall be recruited to achieve geographic, racial/ethnic, and sexual orientation diversity as needed. Special emphasis shall be placed on locating volunteers with experience related to prevention strategies for PLWH.  The contractor shall submit monthly reports on the recruitment efforts and outcome of these efforts to the technical monitor.

B.	Orientation of the Scientists

The contractor shall ensure that all volunteer scientists are oriented to providing TA to CDC-funded (directly or indirectly) organizations.  This orientation shall include a resource packet to assist volunteers in the provision of TA and the completion of an Interest and Background Questionnaire, which will describe the volunteer’s background and training related to HIV prevention and/or care, as well as provision of TA, training, needs assessment, program planning, evaluation, and formative research.  Within 60 days of the effective date of this task order, the contractor shall submit all orientation materials and questionnaires related to the volunteer orientation to the technical monitor for review. 

C.	Training and Volunteer Support

The contractor shall train volunteers and other audiences as identified by CDC. 

	The contractor shall
1.	Conduct one basic training via face-to-face format for 25 volunteers during the term of the task order. The purpose of the training is to familiarize volunteers with CDC, its mission, organization, and constituents; CDC technology transfer activities, including the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) project; HIV prevention community planning; and process evaluation and other assessment activities that support and sustain local use of science-based HIV prevention interventions.  If all volunteers are unfamiliar with these topics, then the basic training should be provided for at least 100 volunteers.

2.	Conduct three advanced training for 25 active, veteran volunteers or facilitate the participation of at least 25 volunteers in three institutes or training of coaches that is sponsored by the DEBI project at CDC during the term of the task order. These trainings may utilize a distance learning format.

a.	The purpose of the advanced training is to provide additional instruction to volunteers who have received the basic training. The training shall address strategies for transferring technology related to needs assessment, formative evaluation, adaptation, and evaluation to increase the use and of science-based interventions among CDC health department grantees and the CBOs that they fund through their CDC funds.  In addition, the advanced training shall serve as coaches’ institutes for the DEBI interventions.  The training shall address one DEBI intervention focusing on prevention needs of people living with HIV.

b.	The purpose of the institutes and training of coaches either sponsored by the contractor or the CDC shall be to equip volunteers to assist CBOs to implement interventions using CDC replication packages. Key contractor staff shall attend each technology transfer institute and the training of coaches to act as resources for volunteers attending the respective training and to coordinate volunteers serving as “coaches” with other CDC-funded TA providers who shall also serve as coaches, as well as with other CDC-funded TA providers who shall serve as intervention trainers. 

The contractor shall submit all draft training materials for review by the technical monitor at least 30 days before the training. The contractor shall submit a report of the activities for each training event with the monthly report to the technical monitor within 30 days after the event.

  3. 	The contractor shall facilitate the attendance of volunteers at any training at which a CBO is receiving training on a DEBI intervention and requests coaching assistance.  CDC will notify the contractor of the dates of all DEBI trainings, and the contractor shall offer volunteers the opportunity to attend these trainings.  For all volunteers who wish to attend, the contractor shall pay travel expenses including all travel to the training site, and hotel and per diem.
   
D.	Linkages

The contractor shall conduct the following activities to facilitate and document linkages between volunteers and health departments, CBOs, and CPGs:

1.	Maintain profiles on each of the scientists, and, with their permission, disseminate the profiles to the technical monitor, other key CDC staff, state AIDS directors, CPG co-chairs, and CDC directly or indirectly funded CBOs involved with HIV prevention. Each profile shall include information on the scientist’s familiarity with behavioral interventions relevant to HIV prevention and/or experience/familiarity with those populations most highly affected by HIV disease. 

2.	Facilitate linkage of volunteers with prevention planners, implementers, agencies, and organizations involved in HIV prevention. The contractor shall facilitate 100 linkages during the term of the task order.  These linkages shall involve a series of interactions that shall be achieved through communication and collaboration between the contractor (or its subcontractor if appropriate) and key personnel from CBOs, local health departments, or CPGs requesting assistance. The contractor shall utilize the Capacity Building Branch’s CBA Request and Information System (CRIS) to respond to linkage requests and to initiate linkage requests on behalf of indirectly funded agencies and non-funded agencies.  As part of the quarterly reports, the contractor shall submit to the technical monitor a brief report on each linkage addressing at least the following: 1) date, 2) nature of linkage, 3) who is linked, 4) action(s) taken, 5) time spent on the linkage, 6) outcome or future activities, and 7) agency satisfaction with the contractor’s services.

3.	Develop or maintain a relationship with the AIDS prevention directors of at least 75% of all CDC-funded jurisdictions in which the contractor shall work with the AIDS prevention director to conduct an assessment of the TA needs of the jurisdiction’s grantees and then develop a plan to meet those needs through linkage with a volunteer.

4.	In accordance with the Advancing HIV Prevention initiative, emphasize prevention with people living with HIV by providing guidance and assistance to prevention providers in addressing these issues:

a.	the complexities regarding prevention counseling and the unique behavioral and social factors that put PLWH at risk for HIV transmission.
b.	integration of prevention strategies for PLWH into nontraditional settings. 
c.	integration of rapid testing into current and novel testing settings and guidance of evaluation strategies.
d.	special issues related to partner counseling, referral, and recruitment for counseling, testing, and referral (i.e., assisting CBOs in crafting appropriate messages for partners of PLWH and HIV-negative persons at high risk for HIV acquisition).
e.	implementation and evaluation of Prevention Case Management in novel settings.

5.	Develop and implement a strategy to ensure attendance by and consultation with volunteers in the community planning process in at least 75% of the jurisdictions that are required by CDC to support a community planning process. An expected outcome is that volunteers shall increase the social science capacity of CPGs.  The technical monitor will provide the contractor with a presentation that volunteers who are linked with a CPG can present to describe the science-based interventions that CDC’s DEBI program supports.  The contractor’s monthly reports shall separately report on volunteer participation in the CPG process. The contractor shall also develop a marketing strategy to inform the CDC’s Prevention Program Branch that volunteer assistance services are available for CPGs.  The contractor shall coordinate with the CBB program consultant monitoring the focus area 4 capacity building assistance providers funded under CDC program announcement 04019 to collaborate on ways to use the volunteers’ services to increase the behavioral science capacity of CPGs.

6.	Develop and implement a strategy to promote the use of volunteer TA providers by CDC indirectly funded community-based organizations. This strategy shall be coordinated with the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD) and the CDC technical monitor. An expected outcome is that smaller community-based organizations that do not receive direct funding from the CDC shall benefit from volunteer TA consultation and increase the use of behavioral sciences in these prevention programs.

  Slone Drug Dictionary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD), contemplates issuing a firm fixed price type contract for this project.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting a multi-site case-cohort study, entitled Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology, CADDRE that examines risk factors associated with autism.  As a component of this study, a maternal interview will be conducted to evaluate exposures and risk factors encountered by the mother and the child.  The Slone Drug Dictionary will be integrated into the data collection application to enable retrieval of information on different drugs, vitamins, and herbs.  

The Slone Drug Dictionary is a computerized system developed and maintained by the Slone Epidemiology Center (SEC) of Boston University.  It is an epidemiologic research tool designed to code prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins, as well as products classified as dietary supplements, including herbals and other natural products.  The Slone Drug Dictionary contains codes for over 14,500 single agents and over 10,000 products and has been used in over 20 Slone Epidemiology Center studies involving over 300,000 subjects.  It has also been successfully used by other investigators in many national and international studies to code and facilitate analysis of a wide range of exposures to traditional medicinal agents as well as dietary supplements and herbal products.  The Slone Drug Dictionary is an established and flexible pharmacoepidemiologic research tool which allows for the coding of new entities while retaining historical information on formulation changes.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors providing the requested product. Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and price prospective. This requirement is a not small business set-aside.

However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow CDC to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.   This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The contemplated period of performance is August 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007.  Proposals for this RFQ are due May 31, 2006.  The RFQ will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for 1. JOB. Replacement of the Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Battery Strings 1 and 2 and the battery model # C&D XT4LCP-15 poly carbonate jars to match the existing ones in the NASA HQ building located at 300 E. St. S.W. See attached battery specifications. The C&D XT4LP-15 battery has identical physical and electrical characteristics, as well as the same electrical connection locations, to the existing batteries in our uninterruptible power supply (UPS) battery room.  That is to say that the battery footprint is the same as the existing batteries so the new C&D XT4LP-15 batteries will fit on the existing battery racks without costly and time intensive rack replacement and the associated extensive  critical systems downtime.  Because of the identical properties of the C&D XT4LP-15, there also would not be a cost or time involved to alter the electrical connections or wiring as the existing wiring and electrical connection points could be reused.  Identical electrical characteristics are paramount for the proper UPS back up power to be supplied to provide seamless operation and data retention of the critical data contained on NASA Headquarters servers in the event of a catastrophic electrical failure.  After comparing the properties of the existing batteries with batteries available from other manufacturers, no identical direct replacement battery was found.	  The provisions and clauses in the RFP are those in effect through FAC 05-09. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 335999 and 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA HQ is required within 120 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia intends to procure the services of a Congregational Pastor at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD.  The statement of work for this requirement is as follows:

The U.S. Naval Academy Command Religious Program (CRP) Congregational Pastor is a principle advisor on pastoral care and spiritual formation for participants from the local community to the Command Chaplain who reports directly to the Superintendent.  The Congregational Pastor will provide the pastoral care, administration and leadership in support of the Command Chaplain’s ministry initiatives.  The Congregational Pastor is primarily responsible for the development and oversight of pastoral care, ministries and programs of the CRP to participants while ensuring alignment with the overall spiritual dimension of the Naval Academy’s mission “to develop midshipmen morally.”  The position is located in the Chaplains Center, United States Naval Academy (USNA).  In this statement of work, the Congregational Pastor is referred to as “provider.”

GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROVIDER’S RESPONSIBILITES:

1.  The environment includes 7,000 faculty, midshipmen and staff living and working on the campus of the Naval Academy (the Yard), their families, and the many people from the local community who participate in Academy chapel activities.  It encompasses working with a staff of active duty Navy chaplains of the Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant faiths, enlisted support personnel, government employees and contract personnel.  Besides the chaplains' office complex, the physical environment includes the historical Naval Academy Chapel, the newly constructed Commodore Uriah P. Levy Center and Jewish Chapel, Mitscher Hall Chapel, a national historic cemetery and columbarium, and various sites on the Yard.   Beyond those personnel who live and work in the Yard, there is significant interaction with parents of midshipmen and candidates, alumni, staff family members, candidates, participants from the local community, as well as tourists

2.  Hours of Performance.  Anticipated work hours are 40 hours per week.  Exact work hours will be based on requirements as defined by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  These are the anticipated number of hours of service per month that shall be provided, and there may be variations of up to plus/minus 10%.

3.  The Command Chaplain provides broadly defined missions and functions.  The provider proceeds with a high degree of independence and self-direction in managing the CRP.  The provider makes extensive un-reviewed programmatic and managerial judgments concerning the interpretation and implementation of CRP policy.  The provider is an ex officio member without vote of the chapel advisory council and provides regular recurring reports.  

4.  Guidelines provided are necessarily and exceptionally broad and general in nature in order to accomplish ministry in a multi-faith, pluralistic environment with a sizeable number of ministry providers and recipients.  Although established regulations must be followed, situations frequently arise which must be handled by the incumbent that do not lend themselves to resolution by established policies or procedures.  Sound judgment is essential.  USNA has a well defined mission, unique to the Navy, to which the mission of the CRP provides its own unique input and support in the form of spiritual formation, support and instruction with the goal of integrating an individual's faith into his/her professional life.  The provider is a recognized expert on ministry and the needs of the various faith groups represented on the Yard, as well as the challenge of the practice of faith as a professional military leader.

Sensitivity to potentially volatile pastoral situations and personal needs, both of congregants and staff, is integral and indispensable to this position.  Consequently, insight to the intended and unintended consequences of decisions, both his/her own and those of other staff members, and an ability to recall past ministry experiences with a view to informing present considerations are necessary to this key staff member.

6.  The work of the Congregational Pastor directly and indirectly affects the spiritual development and formation of participants by helping to provide worshipping congregations within which they can learn and grow in their faith and spiritual formation.  By ensuring respective congregations have the necessary support and proper environment, worshipping communities can flourish and provide spiritual homes for the midshipmen of their respective faith-groups.

He/she will also network with a wide variety of individuals and organizations on the Yard, both in their professional capacity and as congregants of the various faith communities and community churches and faith groups, particularly with regard to their association with participants and also with midshipmen.  It is essential that the provider understand completely and support fully the clergy-penitent privilege.

8.  The provider’s contacts are for the purpose of coordinating, liaising and influencing decisions regarding services needed from different entities and to provide for those same entities.  These may include contacts with visiting dignitaries, Academy senior executives and managers to coordinate public events.

<DESC>AIRCRAFT RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITY 
NAVAL AIR STATION PATUXENT RIVER, PATUXENT RIVER MARYLAND
(DESIGN-BUILD ACQUISITION)

AIRCRAFT RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITY NAVAL AIR STATION PATUXENT RIVER, PATUXENT RIVER MARYLAND (DESIGN-BUILD ACQUISITION) Offerors are reminded that they must respond to the Phase I factors ONLY by 2:00 p.m. EST on 31 May 2006. Phase II factors are provided for informational purposes only and may change with the issuance of the solicitation. All other terms and conditions of the combined synopsis/solicitation not changed by this amendment or previous amendments remain effective.  The Design to Budget for this project is changed to read as follows: The Design to Budget for this project is $19,914,000.00. Factor 6 under Phase II is changed to read as follows: A. General This factor will be rated according to the following: 1. Design concept that demonstrates compliance with the RFP, and adherence to the Solicitation paragraphs that comprise “Project Scope and Objectives”, as delineated at the beginning of this Solicitation, 2. Design concept that provides the greatest quantity of usable building area within the project cost budget, without exceeding the programmed space requirements. 3. Note that if the proposal includes specific nameplate ratings of systems or equipment, the Government is not in a position to evaluate the validity of such proposed ratings during the Solicitation process. As required by the RFP, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to determine the proper ratings of all equipment. If after award, during the design and construction process, it is determined by the Contractor that any of the ratings must be increased, the Offeror shall provide equipment at increased ratings, at no additional cost to the Government. B. Design Concept Submittal Requirements 1. Drawings: Provide schematic site plan, schematic floor plans, elevation and perspective indicating your proposed design solution (provide 11’ x 17” drawings only). Plans and elevations shall illustrate how Offeror intends to meet the requirements of the RFP, including Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection impacts. 2. Basis of Design Narrative: Describes how the Offeror intends to meet the requirements of the RFP for successful execution of the subject project. Basis of Design Narrative should be broken out by section for each discipline and should demonstrate understanding and compliance with the requirements of the RFP. The Intent of the Basis of Design is to briefly explain general approach for addressing the RFP requirements for each of the following disciplines. Size of each section shall not exceed 2 pages. a. Architectural: Material for all major items of the exterior envelope, interior/exterior finishes and AT/FP considerations. Provide a square meter breakdown in the same format as shown in the RFP. b. Structural: Foundation System, Framing, Floor Systems, and Roof Systems. c. Mechanical: HVAC, chiller plant, and plumbing systems. d. Electrical: Electrical power systems and lighting. e. Life Safety & Handicap Accessibility: Building compliance with safety codes, fire protection and detection, and handicap accessibility. Also, DOD anti-terrorism / force protection requirements (note that any interpretations of DOD AT/FP must be approved by NAVFAC). f. Sustainable Design: The Navy desires that their facilities and construction methods incorporate sustainable design features to the greatest extent possible. Proposers are required to meet the requirements of the current minimum certified level of the LEED Green Building Rating System, and are encouraged to meet a higher rating within the identified project budget. Present the sustainable design features in tabular format (on LEED / Green Building Council “Project Checklist”) to aid in the evaluation of proposals. ( Project Checklist is not included in page limitation.) Factor 7 under Phase II is changed to read as follows: The design and construction schedule for this project is negotiable, and realistic schedules that indicate completion in the shortest time will be viewed as favorable. By incorporation of the proposed schedule to the contract, the offeror agrees to comply with FAR 52.211-10, Commencement, Prosecution and Completion of Work (Apr 1984) and FAR 52.211-12, Liquidated Damages. Provide a narrative to demonstrate your team’s approach to accomplish the work. Describe the logic and sequence of events necessary for the successful execution of this project. Also provide a graphic timeline using Microsoft Project or a similar software. Provide a CPM schedule from contract award through construction completion. Identify critical path activities, milestones, durations and other important activities during post-contract award, design, fabrication, construction, and commissioning. The presentation shall clearly show the logic and sequence of events necessary for the successful execution of the project. Maximum design and construction duration shall be 550 days. Shorter schedule durations are viewed positively. All days are "calendar days". Price under Phase II is changed to read as follows: This Design-Build Project has a Design to Budget of $19,914,000.00. Offerors must provide a proposal that meets the scope of this project at the specified budget. Price shall be provided on the Price Schedule included in the solicitation. The proposal should contain a breakdown of pricing in the Construction Standard Industry (CSI) format. Prices will be evaluated in terms of reasonableness based on a comparison of the Government Estimate and other prices received. If necessary, Offerors should identify any items in the scope the have been deleted or modified in order to meet the stated budget. Items that are deleted or modified should be clearly described and include the associated price. In all cases, the most viable design solutions should be presented for the stated budget. If technical issues are included in the price proposal, they must also be included in the technical proposal. If the offeror determines that the project cannot be designed and constructed for a price that falls within the budget, scope variances shall be proposed for the Government’s consideration. Each variance shall specifically identify the impact to the overall project and include an associated price. Added value is more important than reduced pricing. If the proposed price falls within the budget, enhancements to the scope are encouraged for consideration by the Government. Each shall specifically identify why the offeror believes it is an enhancement to the project and include an associated price. An offer that provides a higher overall value within the budget will be rated higher than an offer of lesser overall value. The determination of best value will take into consideration the acceptability of proposed variances and enhancements.

<DESC>This Amendment does not change the date that offers are due. The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions that have been received regarding Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 06PR-TDP-312. Reponses to Questions as of May 22, 2006:

Question #1

Will a team that includes subcontractors with specialized expertise be considered?

Answer: Yes. A team that includes subcontractors will be considered.

Question #2

Must any of the team members be located in the Washington D.C. area? If the team lead is available to travel to D.C. as required, can the majority of the work (writing, media contact, etc.) be done virtually?

Answer: No person is required to be located in Washington DC. However, the duties of the position (see 5.5 of Statement of Work) sometimes require the contractor to be in Washington DC. It is estimated that the contractor will need to be in Washington D.C. 12 to 15 times per year.

Question #3

Does the annual report entail any design, or is it strictly text and data?

Answer: The annual report is more than text and data. I would recommend that you look to the IRS Oversight Board web site for examples. (www.treas.gov/irsob)

Question #4

How long is the annual report and what type of format is typically produced?

Answer: The last three annual reports have been 2005 (48), 2004 (49), and 2003 (30) pages long. Examples of the format produced can be found on the IRS Board web site previously referenced.

Question #5
Should travel expenses be incorporated into the proposal, or should expenses be estimated separately and billed at cost?
Answer: Travel expenses should be incorporated into the proposal and Travel should be reimbursed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. The applicable regulations can be found at www.gsa/ftr.gov .

Question #6
Is there a preferred format in which you would like to receive our response to this bid? 
Answer: There is no preferred format for the response. Please see FAR 52.212-1 for instructions for offerors.
Question #7
Do we need to provide estimated costs for the 4 option years?
Answer: Yes.
Question #8
Should past performance references be federal government agencies or, since my company has not worked for the federal government before, will other client references be accepted?
Answer: Past performance references are not restricted to federal government agencies. All references will be evaluated.
Question #9
I would also be interested in learning when you expect to make a decision and award a contract, if you have that information and can you share it. 
Answer: There is no definitive date set for decision and award. Under simplified acquisition procedures, unsuccessful offerors are not required to be notified. (See FAR 13.106-3) If you desire to be notified, please request notification in writing.
Question #10
How many “additional reports”, as stated in the solicitation, are expected?
Answer: The number of additional reports varies from year to year. Due to the difficulty in predicting circumstances that may warrant a need to produce an additional report, any response to this question would be mere speculation; and, therefore no number will be provided. Reports that were completed in past years are available on the IRS Oversight Board web site.
Question #11
Will you need assistance in planning/producing the Board meetings, either within the Oversight Board’s offices or those held elsewhere?
Answer: The statement of work contained in the body of the combined synopsis/solicitation details the responsibility of the contractor regarding Board meetings.
Question #12 
Will Contractors be given an opportunity to meet with the Program Officer?
Answer: No
Question #13
Will select Contractors be given an opportunity to present their proposal and examples of their work in person?
Answer: No Contractor, select or otherwise, will be given an opportunity to present their proposal beyond their submission as required in the solicitation.

<DESC>If there are any additional questions please submit them by 4:00pm Tuesday, May 23, 2006 by e-mail to Sherrie Randall at sherrie.randall@forscom.army.mil. 1.) Would you kindly advise if the Hazardous Material Technical Curriculum required under section 6 is only a listing of the proposed courses that will satisfy the requirements of the US Army Chemical School Conditions and Standards for Domestic Reconnaiss ance, Tasks DNBCR 4-21, or a more expansive document? 	-The course should satisfy the requirements of the US Army Chemical School Conditions and Standards for Domestic Reconnaissance, Tasks DNBCR 4-21. 2.) Can you confirm that this solicitation is a small business set-aside or full and open? 	-Full and Open 3.) It appears that this is a NFPA 472 HAZMAT Tech class taught for certification, I just wanted to confirm this. 	 -The course meets NFA 472 requirements and OSHA 29 CFR 1910-120 requirements. 4.) Will we be able to teach this class at our location? 	-Yes 5.) Will the students be able to produce a certificate (either one that was taught for certification or a course that followed NFPA 472 guidelines)? This is a prerequisite for the Tech course. The tech course is taught in 5 days and I saw that the course d elivery dates covered a period of 14 days - why so much time? 	 -The course is enhanced to exceed the minimum Tech hours and must include awareness, operations, and tech level information. 6.) If these people do not have Hazmat A&O certification/training, we would need to do this prior  to conducting the tech class?	 -Needs to be included in the program 7.) Will the contractor be responsible for providing all consumables for the class and training props?  	Yes  8.) There are 2 similar solicitations out on Hazardous Material Technician Training, W911SE-06-T-0030 and W911SE-06-T-0031, which one is correct? -W911SE-06-T-0031. W911SE-06-T-0030 has been canceled 9.) Can trainers be from an institute affiliated with a University (outreach and extension) bid on this work as universities are excluded from the NAICS code listed?  	-Yes 10.) Where will the training actually occur?  	At the contractors facility 11.) Is the training strictly for Hazardous Material Technician level training only (i.e. not operations level, etc.)? 	-See question #5 12.) What are the dates of training?   	9-22 July 2006, 6-19 August 2006, 10-23 September 2006, and 15-28 October 2006 13.) If training is to be conducted at Fort McPherson, are there facilities in place for classroom training as well as field exercises? 	-The training will be at the contractors facility 14.) How many students are anticipated per class? 	24 15.) Will the contractor be responsible to provide manuals, handouts, etc. or are materials available from the U.S. Army Chemical School?  	-The contractor is responsible for all manuals, handouts, etc. 16.) Will the contractor be responsible to provide PPE, response and training equipment or is there existing PPE and equipment we can use? 	This is the contractors responsibility 17.) If PPE and equipment is to be provided by contractor, can you provide a list, including make and model or equipment currently used? 	This is the contractors responsibility 18.) Will we need to submit both a technical proposal in addition to the cost proposal? 	-The technical portion of the proposal should contain all of the requirements listed in the solicitation in addition to the cost proposal. 19.)   Who is the primary audience for the course?  US Army Reserve Personnel 20.) Given that there are different requirements for Commanders vs. say, a platoon sgt, is it your expectation that classes should be general in nature to speak to the group or geared toward a particular audience (i.e. Command Staff vs line individuals)? -HAZMAT Technician generic, command issues need to be discussed only 21.)  Also, is it your expectation that course outlines acco mpany the proposal or are you expecting the completed course product? 	 -The completed course product to validate information material 22.) Do you envision this training to be conducted as classroom or exercise (lanes) related or both? 	-Both 23.) Please provide us with a list of the required tasks as well as a Point of Contact at the US Army Chemical School that works with vendors for pre-approvals. 	A Point of Contact for the US Army Chemical School is not available. General Numbers for the US Army Chemical School are (573) 596-0131(Training) (573)  563  7688 (Homeland Security)
