Meanwhile, SEC-Lee is required to provide system support to all STAMIS.<BR><BR>The extension is necessary to provide for the continues combat readiness of our troops. It is critical that this delivery order be extended through December 31, 2010.   <BR><BR>The purpose of  the PDSS contract is to obtain a performance-based arrangement for acquisition management, development, implementation, deployment, training,testing, documentation,and sustainment of assigned systems throughout their program lifecycle for PM, LIS.   PDSS - is the sum of all activities required to ensure that, during the production/deployment phase of a mission critical computer system's life cycle, the implemented and fielded software/system continues to support its original operational mission and subsequent mission modifications mandated by DOD/DA and product improvement efforts.  PDSS generally consists of software maintenance to correct defects in existing software, changes to DOD/DA policies and regulations, and hardware upgrades, testing of the software to ensure performance meets the requirements of the changed processes and that processes that were not changed still function as before, and documentation is updated in accordance with change.  Provide both functional and as required technical support both telephonically and at user sites; provide training for software and/or hardware changes when tasked by PM LIS.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The mission of the USDI BIA OTS DFWFM Branch of Forest Resources Planning (BOFRP) is to have forest management plans on every acre of forested land held in trust status by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for client Tribes. Due to a shortage of BIA and Tribal forestry staff available for this type of project work in the Southern Plains Region of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the only way that this planning can be practically accomplished is by a qualified and competent forest planning contractor (professional forester) who has the ability to offer services and receive payment on a per planning component basis.
The Alabama-Coushatta reservation has approximately 5,000 acres forest land in South east Texas. The Forest Management Plan Project will consist of four planning components. The total cost of the project will be the sum of the four following planning components. 
On a planning component basis, the contractor will provide the following forestry services and associated digital and hardcopy output (forest management Plan and Environmental Document) for the Alabama-Coushatta forest land in trust status.
1.	Delineate stand boundaries on digital orthoquads2.	Match existing timber cruise data to mapped timber stands3.	Use inventory data and stand maps to prepare forest management plan4.	Prepare appropriate environmental document

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Applied Research and Technology, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Brown University, Center for Environmental Health and Technology, Professor. E. Andres Houseman, to develop Open-source architecture for Bayesian decision models in occupational hygiene and exposure assessment.
<p>Purpose and objective: CDC's mission is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability, NIOSH provides national and world leadership to prevent work-related illness, injury, disability, and death by gathering information, conducting scientific research, and translating the knowledge gained into products and services.

Stakeholders include practitioners, regulatory bodies such as OSHA, DOD, DOE, DHS and EPA, and academic programs</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a computationally-efficient robust Bayesian framework to incorporate possibly informative prior distributions from expert exposure assessment judgment, exposure models, and other exposure estimation methods into a data interpretation, analysis, and decision-making system specifically for the small sample (n=3-20 objective exposure measurements) occupational exposure compliance problem.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12470.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to Tomtec, 1000 Sherman Ave., Hamden, CT 06514 for the acquisition of Quadra 4 NS SPE instrument.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 339999, All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 60-90 days.</p>
<p>Tomtec sells a system which is unique to the field of liquid handlers. The Tomtec Quadra 4 is a semi-automated system which has no equivalent due to its capability and incorporation into several CDC response methods. The Tomtec Quadra 4 is unique because it can perform simplified solid phase extraction for micro-plate processing in a manner that other systems cannot. The Quadra 4 is the only semi automated liquid handler that provides the ability to manually and semi-automatically process liquid samples in a 96-well format, it is already in use at the CDC, and it is available in a positive pressure processing format.</p>
<p>Tomtec is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because it supplies a positive pressure and a manual vacuum system.. The Quadra 4 is semi-automated with options for manual control where required and the instrument is compatible with other existing equipment. Other contractors were considered but did not meet the Government's needs due to a number of reasons which include the inability to process samples using positive pressure, the inability to manually manipulate samples in a similar fashion to the Quadra 4, the inability to process samples online, and the speed of other systems was slower than that of the Quadra 4.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Tomtec. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 82585 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 24, 2010. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Unintentional Injury, intends to award a sole source contract to Pacific Institute Research and Evaluation (PIRE), 11720 Beltsville Drive, Suite 900, Calverton, MD 20705-3166 for the analysis of the 2007 National Roadside Survey data.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is for Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation to provide available data on people who ride with drinking drivers. In addition to data on passengers of drinking drivers, this dataset also contains information on the trip including information about the drinking driver. Because of this, the relationship between the driver and passenger can be examined in addition to examining prevalence.</p>
<p>Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation is the only responsible source that can analyze and provide access to the data from the 2007 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers. There are no other recent datasets that collect information on the passenger, driver, and trip and provide information on the BAC of the driver and the amount of alcohol that the passenger has ingested. As a result of Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation being the only contractor with access to this data, no other vendor is qualified to conduct these tasks without substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-Q-12468 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 24, 2010. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), Paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUNPOWER ADVANCEDSTIRLING CONVERTOR (ASC).The NASA Glenn Research Center intends to award a contract to Sunpower, Inc. for thecontinued development of the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC), including the nextgeneration ASC-E3 and its variants.  The ASC is being developed to meet the requirementsof NASAs Radioisotope Power Conversion (RPS) program for highly efficient, low mass,reliable power convertors that enable the reduction of plutonium fuel requirements by afactor of four compared to current state-of-the-art thermoelectric systems.  Due to thelow U.S. plutonium inventory, development of high efficiency systems is critical tofuture NASA Space Science and Exploration missions.  The Sunpower ASC technology wasoriginally developed under a previously competed NRA (02-OSS-01) contract that resultedin delivery of several generations of ASC that uses Sunpower intellectual property,patents, data rights, or trade secrets.  The ASC convertors progressively demonstratedcapabilities to meet RPS flight requirements, culminating in the ASC-E2 convertors.  TheASC-E3 to be developed as part of the proposed new contract will validate newrequirements-driven design refinements, fabrication processes, and quality assurancestandards, and will verify that the design meets RPS requirements, specifically that ofthe Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG).  Requirements for the ASC-E3include:	Greater than 79 watts electrical power and greater than 38% conversion efficiency(electrical power out/net heat input) at Beginning of Mission reference conditions of850C Thot and 90C Treject.	Greater than 75 watts electrical power and greater than 40% conversion efficiencyat End of Mission reference conditions of 850C Thot and 36C Treject.	Capable of operating at 850C Thot, defined as the acceptor temperature.	Mass of less than 2.6 kg including heat collector and cold-side adapterflange thermal and structural interfaces. 	Non-wearing parts and no lubrication	Capable of meeting the 17 year life requirement (3 years storage, plus 14 yearmission)	Provide piston telemetry for health monitoring of the convertor withoutfeedthroughs	Not susceptible to exposure to radiation of 50 krad	Hermetically sealed design for reliability and long life 	Mature technology including demonstrated and independently verified performanceand mass	Demonstrated integration of the convertor configuration within an electricallyheated ASRG generator	Unchanged operation after Vibration testing:  Each convertor is tested atworkmanship level vibration;  the convertor configuration must be validated for launchlevel vibration, and qualification level vibrationThe contract shall provide design, analysis, trade studies, hardware production, testing,and associated tasks needed to continue development of the ASC for potential use onfuture NASA missions that require RPS.	This includes eight (8) ASC-E3 convertors, withoptions for additional units.  Development of variants based on the ASC design to meetnew and evolving requirements are also included such as higher rejection temperatures,different generator configurations or scaling of the design to meet additional RPS powerrequirements.  The contract also includes support of NASA GRCs in-house Stirlingdevelopment including consultation and support related to the operation, maintenance,reconfiguration, study, and any potential repair of the various ASC convertors alreadydelivered by Sunpower under the previous NASA contract or the new contract.  Further, thecontract includes technology development and system integration support tasks related tothe ASC including studies, hardware evaluations, design modifications, and development ofmission kits to provide data to NASA, Department of Energy, system integration partners,and potential mission planners.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 23, 2010.

GOVPAY
GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>This is a follow up synopsis to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00421-10-NR-55021. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-273 NAVAL UNDERGRADUATE FLIGHT TRAINING SYSTEMS, Patuxent River, MD has a requirement for tasking and equipment required for Organization, Intermediate, and possibly Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support for the USN T-34, T-44 and T-6 trainer aircraft programs. This support is currently being performed under Contract N00019-06-D-0017 awarded to Sikorsky Support Services, Inc (SSSI). In addition, Contract N00019-10-C-0051 was awarded to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC to primarily assist SSSI with on-site scheduled maintenance for both T-34 and T-44 to recover Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) FY10 Pilot Throughput Rate (PTR). The NAVAIR Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) website is available at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to assorted satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms at the following satellite sights: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC).</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC). The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.</p>
<p>THE USN NO LONGER INTENDS TO USE SEAPORT-E TO SOLICIT OFFERS FOR THIS EFFORT AND NOW INTENDS TO USE FULL &amp; OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES VIA FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES USING SOLICITATION NUMBER N00019-10-R-0069. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATION RELEASE IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN SEPTEMBER WITH INDUSTRY SITE VISITS TO VIEW THE MATERIAL CONDITION OF AIRCRAFT AFTER SOLICITATION RELEASE. FULL PERFORMANCE IS ANTICIPATED TO COMMENCE BY 1 APRIL 2011. Please continue to monitor this website, as well as the NAVAIR open solicitation website at the following URL http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm for updated information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Attached hereto is a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and DRAFT associated documents for industry's review and feedback. The Government has incorporated comments provided during previous PMA 273 industry days and one-on-one sessions, and is receptive to additional ideas to further reduce or limit constraining requirements, approaches to reduce risks, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award, and the Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) reflects areas of interest and concern to the Government. The PMF represents a more focused means of measuring Contractor performance, and measures alignment with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Sustainment, Performance and ultimately PTR. The Government is seeking input with respect to the notional incentive arrangement itself, and how best to incentivize meeting PTR, which is a critical component of CNATRA's mission.&nbsp; The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the upcoming requirement is intended to include at least a base year with one (1) or two (2) one-year options. The final selection of contract types and the scope of work within each type have not been determined at this time. Fixed price elements are likely to be associated with Total Lifecycle Product Support (TLPS), other than conditional maintenance. Cost reimbursement elements are likely to be associated with conditional maintenance and the parts and consumables. The Government expects to project expenditures for the parts and consumable cost reimbursement elements, based on past experience in the procurement of parts and consumables supporting the PWS. Incentive elements are likely to be associated with attainment of performance measured by the PMF. The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions regarding contract type, incentive arrangements, and contract line item structure.</p>
<p><strong>The Government invites industry feedback via written comments, recommendations, and questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 24 June 2010; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals. </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the requested written submittals, PMA-273 intends to host one-on-one sessions with industry for those who wish to offer comments and recommendations in person. The intent of the one-on-one sessions is to get meaningful feedback regarding the requirement and the structure of the PWS and PMF. <strong>The one-on-one sessions will be held during the week of 14 June 2010, and shall not be longer than two (2) hours per session.</strong> Attendance for the one-on-one sessions is limited to three attendees per company. This is a no fee event and seating is limited. Contractors are directed not to present proprietary information submitted in writing or presented during the one-on-ones; any information submitted will become Government property and not be returned to the contractor. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting. The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the one-on-one's. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Responses and comments will not be published, nor will they be released.</p>
<p><strong>Any questions concerning this synopsis, and requests for scheduling industry one-on-one's shall be submitted via email to Jessica McGee at Jessica.mcgee@navy.mil. One-on-one's shall be scheduled no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on 9 June 2010. </strong></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>NOTE: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award and payment from any DOD activity. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements for CCR may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Flagstaff, Arizona, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 11,960 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Boise, Idaho, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,442 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

The space must be available for occupancy by March 3, 2012. The building must be located in the Central Business District of Boise, Idaho.
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>CAP SECTION 14, ELK RIVER, near the City of Elk River, Sherburne County, Minnesota.<BR>The work consists of, but is not limited to, furnishing all plant, labor, material, and equipment to stabilize the existing riverbank adjacent to Sherburne County Road 35 on the Elk River where overland flow from the roadway adjacent to the river combined with channel flow at the base of the slope has resulted in erosion of the bank to within a few feet of the shoulder of the road.  Remedial actions to stabilize the slope include removal of the exposed portions of existing timber retaining walls and drainage culvert followed by placement of R20 riprap and B1 bedding on the exposed channel bank to a finished 1V on 2H slope. The minimum thicknesses of the R20 riprap and B1 bedding are 12 inches and 6 inches, respectively. The R20 riprap and B1 bedding are standard Corps gradations used on similar projects. In addition to the riprap and bedding slope, a riprap bench with a 5-foot top width and a minimum 18 inch thickness will be placed at the toe of the slope.  Approximately 350 linear feet of concrete curb and gutter will be constructed along the south shoulder of the highway to divert overland flow away from the critical area of erosion to a location further east where it can be safely discharged into a swale adjacent to the highway. An erosion stabilization mat along with topsoil and seed will be placed at the location where the flow enters the swale. Restoration of the site will include replacement of pavement damaged by construction as well as establishment of turf along the top of the channel bank above the riprap, including placement of topsoil, seed, and an erosion control blanket. A guard rail approximately 275 in length will be installed adjacent to the highway. In addition, the project will incorporate curb and gutter drainage at the edge of the road to divert storm water away from the exposed bank.  Storm water will be diverted away from the site, down a grass swale with a gradual grade. The grass swale will include a vegetative mat cover to prevent scour while the grass is being established. A guard rail will also be installed at the top of the bank where the channel bank is close to the roadway.<BR><BR>The estimated price range for this acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.  This solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bids (IFB) and will be 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. The solicitation with drawings will be issued on or about August 13, 2010.  <BR>

<DESC><p>42nd Contracting Squadron proposes to award to College Options Foundation, LLC on a sole source basis. This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(2), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. A firm-fixed-price contract is anticipated. The period of performance is 2 August 2010 - 17 July 2011.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. Interested parties may provide a Statement of Capabilities to be considered by the agency. If no written responses are received by 23 Jul 10; 4:00 PM CST, the contract will be awarded without further notice.</p>
<p>The Challenge shall include two on-line preliminary rounds of competition between participating JROTC units, wherein an unlimited number of 4-person teams go on-line at specified times to compete with each other by answering questions posed by the offeror and/or competing via games produced by Disney-MGM for the offeror via interactive software. In advance of these rounds, the offeror will provide ASVAB/ACT/SAT test improvement software CDs, based upon the type questions found on these nationally recognized entry tests, to each participating unit to assist in preparation. Winners of the preliminary rounds will then be scheduled for a Final Round at a college site mutually acceptable to the Air Force to facilitate a live, in-person championship round, comparable to the old television show that competed college students in an academic college bowl setting. The offeror will provide, as part of the contract, professional academic bowl moderators and organizers to coordinate all logistical support to include lodging, transportation (one-six passenger vehicle will be authorized per team for those teams not driving to the event) and meals for all cadets, instructors and chaperones. The offeror will provide lodging for 5 cadets (4 team members plus 1 alternate), 1 instructor and (if required for dual gender teams) an additional chaperone for 3 nights. The offeror will provide all questions, buzzer systems, materials and supplies needed for the event. The dates of the in-person championship round will be determined by Air Force JROTC headquarters based on availability of academic teams and resources. Overseas teams that compete online and win a spot to the final round will be offered a stipend of $3,500 to cover transportation. The offeror will be responsible for all local transportation, billeting and meals for all cadets, instructors and chaperones.</p>
<p>College Options Foundation, LLC has been used by Air Force JROTC, Army and Navy JROTC as a source for supplemental SAT/ACT prep software for their programs for several years. The Air Force JROTC program's goal is to encourage cadets to live up to their full potential, build better citizens for America and contribute to the success(es) of students pursuing a college education and/or military service. It is important to continue to purchase services from College Options Foundation, LLC and to maintain the same program used by Army and Navy JROTC managers to implement identical Academic Bowl competitions. By using the sources from College Options Foundation, LLC, Air Force, Army and Navy JROTCs are staying in line with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and joint ROTC service senior leaders for ROTC initiatives to drive all service JROTC programs to common curricula and programs. In addition, Tri-Service ROTC Conference mandates that the service JROTC programs continue to work toward common program elements, courses, etc.</p>
<p>College Options Foundation, LLC will conduct a competitive Academic Bowl Challenge to reach 110,000 plus AFJROTC cadets at the program's 884 units. The Academic Bowl Challenge will consist of three levels of competitions using two on-line preliminary rounds and a final live round. The preliminary rounds will mirror ACT/SAT/ASVAB tests from test improvement software and from products by the Holm Center, Maxwell AFB, AL.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that have the capability to develop revised standards of seismic safety for existing federally owned and leased buildings.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition strategy for this requirement is for a firm fixed-price purchase order.</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND:<br />In Executive Order 12941 (reference 1.a.(1)), the President directed that minimum federal standards of seismic safety for existing federally owned or leased buildings, known herein as the "Standards," be adopted and then updated at least as often as every five years. The last update of the Standards is in the form of ICSSC RP 6 (reference 1.a.(2)). It is necessary to update the Standards.<br />Since ICSSC RP 6 was issued, two American Society of Civil Engineers publications have been issued that can support this update, ASCE/SEI 31-03 and ASCE/SEI 41-06, references 1.a.(3) and 1.a.(4). In addition, the International Building Code (IBC), reference 1.a.(5), has been updated, and the International Existing Building Code (IEBC), reference 1.a.(6), has been promulgated to provide model building code requirements for the evaluation and rehabilitation of seismically hazardous existing buildings. <br />OMB Circular A-119, reference 1.a.(7), directs federal agencies to "use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards in their procurement and regulatory activities, except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical." National model building codes are such consensus standards, so they should serve as the primary source of federal construction requirements whenever possible. <br />Finally, many of the federal agencies have gained substantial <br /><br />B. SCOPE OF WORK:<br />The Contractor shall analyze ICSSC RP 6 to determine where new technical information, such as ASCE/SEI 31-03, ASCE/SEI 41-06, and the IBC/IEBC can be applied in the Standards to improve technical accuracy. Secondly, the Contractor shall analyze the experience of the federal agencies in their implementation of ICSSC RP 6 to determine where improvements in that implementation can be made and where OMB Circular A-119 provisions should be applied. Third, the Contractor shall prepare, in coordination with NIST, a revised edition of the Standards that will be proposed for adoption to the ICSSC agencies. <br />This update of the Standards shall be consistent with the stated intent of ICSSC RP 6, "... to identify common minimum evaluation and mitigation measures for all federal departments and agencies, and to ensure that all federal entities have a balanced, agency-conceived, and controlled seismic safety program for their existing owned or leased buildings." It is not the intent of this task order to develop new federal agency requirements that are either more or less stringent than those stated in ICSSC RP 6. Rather, it is the intent of this task order to improve the stated requirements to take advantage of both technical advances and of agency experiences since ICSSC RP 6 was released, and to ensure compliance with OMB Circular A-119.<br /><br />C. SPECIFIC TASKS<br />The Contractor shall provide the professional, technical and support personnel, services, materials, equipment and facilities necessary in satisfying the objective and conducting the work as required in the following:<br /><br />Project Technical Team Formation: Within 15 calendar days of task order award, the Contractor shall appoint a Project Director (PD) who shall have overall responsibility for project management. The PD shall be a structural engineering practitioner with proven experience in seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of existing federal buildings. The PD shall have overall responsibility for project management and technical performance. Within 30 calendar days of task order award, the Contractor shall appoint a Project Technical Committee (PTC) composed of the PD as PTC chair and at least two other eminently qualified earthquake engineering practitioners. The PTC shall have proven experience in seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of existing buildings, including federally leased buildings; seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of non-structural details associated with existing buildings; and, experience in foundation analysis associated with seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of existing buildings. The PTC shall be responsible for the technical quality and practical direction of the project, under the direction of the PD. PTC members shall not be associated with any specific materials industry or be in the employment of any industry associations or interests. This shall not be interpreted to mean that practitioners who have been occasionally funded by such interests would be exempt from participation. The PTC shall review project activities on a regular basis and be available for immediate consultation as required. All project documents shall be approved by the PTC prior to distribution. The PTC shall be responsible for reviewing project deliverables and providing advice and consultation throughout the project. The Contractor shall consider experience, expertise, and geographic, gender, and ethnic diversity in selecting the PD and PTC members. All participant selections shall be made in consultation with NIST. The Contractor shall also include representatives from FEMA and NIST as ex-officio members of the PTC.<br /><br />Project Work Plan Development: Within 45 calendar days of task order award, the Contractor shall confer with the NIST COTR to review the task order and develop an outline for the investigation of necessary information to satisfy the task objective. Based on this meeting and the requirements of this task, the Contractor shall develop a Project Work Plan (PWP) that outlines the overall project performance strategy and estimates other Contractor requirements for task completion. <br /><br />Federal Agency Input Meeting: Within 30 days of COTR approval of the PWP, the Contractor shall schedule, organize and host a one-day workshop for the PTC and representatives of participating agencies from the ICSSC. At this meeting, the PTC shall outline potential technical improvements that could be made to the Standards based on advances that have occurred since the release of ICSSC RP 6 and seek ICSSC responses to those potential improvements. At this same meeting, the PTC shall seek ICSSC inputs on potential programmatic improvements that could be made to the Standards, consistent with the stated Objective and based on their field experiences with implementing the provisions of ICSSC RP 6. This input meeting would be announced by official correspondence from NIST that invited ICSSC participation and requested ICSSC inputs. The PTC shall accept written inputs from ICSSC agencies that are unable to attend this meeting, if those inputs are received no later than the date of the meeting.<br /><br />Development of Initial Draft Updated Standards: Within 60 days of the Federal Agency Input Meeting, the Contractor shall produce proposed updated Standards (a "new" ICSSC RP 6) that addressees changes to the existing Standards that arise in the Federal Agency Input meeting. NIST will distribute this draft update in electronic form to the ICSSC agencies, for their review.<br /><br />Federal Agency Review Meeting: Within 90 days of the Federal Agency Input Meeting, the Contractor shall host a second one-day workshop for the PTC and representatives of participating agencies from the ICSSC. At this review meeting, the PTC shall present the draft Standards and solicit review feedback from the participating ICSSC agencies. With NIST support, the PTC shall seek to reach agency consensus at the meeting on the draft Standards.<br /><br />Development of Final Draft Updated Standards: Within 30 days of the Federal Agency Review Meeting, the Contractor shall produce a final draft of the updated Standards in a form that is suitable for official publication as a NIST Grant or Contractor Report (GCR).<br /><br />Publication of Updated Standards: Following receipt of the final draft of the updated Standards, NIST will review the draft and, within 15 days, provide inputs for needed edits to the draft. Within 15 days of receiving these needed edits from NIST, the Contractor shall produce a camera-ready final draft of the revised Standards.<br /><br />Federal Agency Orientation Meeting : Within 30 days of the completion of publication, the Contractor shall host a workshop for ICSSC agency representatives. At the workshop, if it is funded, the PTC shall brief the attendees on how the provisions of the updated Standards can be implemented.</p>
<p>D. DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERABLE DUE DATES:<br /><br />(1) The Contractor shall submit recommendations for the PD and PTC members within 30 days of effective date of award.<br />(2) The Contractor shall submit a draft Project Work Plan (PWP) within 45 calendar days of award. Following this submittal, the NIST COTR will provide review comments. The Contractor shall submit a final Project Work Plan within 15 calendar days of receiving the NIST review comments.<br />(3) The Contractor shall submit an initial draft of the updated Standards to the NIST Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) within 60 days following the Federal Agency Input Meeting.<br />(4) The Contractor shall submit a final draft of the updated Standards to the NIST COTR within 30 days following the Federal Agency Review Meeting.<br />(5) Within 15 days of producing the camera-ready final draft of the updated Standards, the Contractor shall publish the final version of the updated Standards as a NIST Grant/Contract Report (GCR). NIST will provide a report number for use by the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the Standards in electronic form, both WORD and PDF formats, and shall provide 250 printed copies of the Standards for distribution to the ICSSC members.<br />(6) The Contractor shall provide a draft MS PowerPoint file no later than 30 days after receipt of deliverable (5. The file shall be used to brief meeting attendees on how the updated standards can be implemented. The COTR will provide comments on the draft presentation no later than five (5) days after receipt of the presentation.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. <br /><br />
<p>National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine annually acquires over 400 monographs in the Japanese language, and it has an arrearage of over 900 titles in this language which the Cataloging Section is mandated to eliminate during the next fiscal year. NLM requires ongoing assistance in cataloging these monographs since it does not have the necessary resources or the language expertise to catalog them.</p>
<p>Contracted cataloging assistance has been an essential activity for the last several years during which the Cataloging Section contracted for the cataloging of foreign language materials in order to meet its mandate of providing bibliographic control and for announcing the Library's acquisitions to the biomedical library community.</p>
<p>The purpose of this purchase order is to acquire copy or limited cataloging of 200-350 Japanese language monographs. Cataloging shall include the vernacular script elements of the description.</p>
<p>The project entails limited or copy cataloging for a minimum of 200 and a maximum of 350 Japanese language monographs. The tasks of the project include: 1) searching an outside source (i.e., OCLC) to retrieve copy cataloged records when available and identifying any duplicates to be returned to NLM uncataloged; 2) completing the cataloging, including vernacular script descriptive elements, subject analysis, classification, and authority work, according to established cataloging rules and NLM copy cataloging procedures; and 3) preparing limited cataloging records for items for which no available copy is identified, according to established cataloging rules, including vernacular script descriptive elements, subject analysis, classification, and authority work, and following NLM cataloging procedures.</p>
<p>Vendor Requirements</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the vendor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this purchase order, as needed to perform the work as stated above.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement must identify the responder's small business type and size.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 4:30pm Eastern Standard time on Wednesday July 21, 2010 to Ms. Uyen Phuong at phuongu@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting/default.aspx .  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division is seeking prospective sources for existing Flash and or Sound Suppressors for the family of Special Operations Forces (SOF) small arms, including carbines, lightweight machine guns, and sniper rifles.  Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division is seeking improved methods of attachment, enhanced flash and or sound suppression for:  M4A1, MK11, MK12, MK13, MK14, MK15, MK16, MK17, MK18, MK20 (SSR), M240 family, M249, MK46 and MK48 Crew Served Weapons.  This effort is named Family of Muzzle Brakes and Suppressors (FMBS) until such time as the Government may assign formal nomenclature.  The Weapons Accessories (WPNAC) Special Operations Peculiar Modification Kit (SOPMOD) Program managed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward ordnance and electronics, processes, systems, subsystems and components in support of our nation's war fighters.  The mission of the SOPMOD M4A1 Accessory Kit is to provide the M4A1 Carbine and SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) with the flexibility and versatility to adapt basic issue weapons to meet SOF mission-specific requirements.  Because Special Operations Forces lack organic heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery and are limited in capacity to carry or resupply ammunition, success and survival often depends on the effective employment of individual weapons.  Items contained within the SOPMOD Kit enhance the weapon's operational effectiveness through increased target recognition/acquisition, speed of engagement, accuracy, and signature suppression.  WPNAC SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to upgrade its subsystems with new combat technologies.  The FMBS effort is underway to identify commercial items that exhibit marked improvement in performance over fielded signature suppression items and to extend signature suppression to designated weapons currently without signature suppression.   The WPNAC program management office is interested in receiving current product and product information in support of the Family of Muzzle Brakes and Suppressors (FMBS) mission area.  This submission may be in the form of commercial product literature, operating instructions, and/or supplemental technical documentation that define the item and associated hardware.  Request that potential sources address Fit, Function, Flash Suppression, Sound Suppression, Accuracy, and Interoperability.  Potential sources should also provide any test results on the item, and should certify that the product is safe for use for its intended purpose.  A technical description of the product, such as physical characteristics, operational features, performance data, photographs, and physical characteristics should be included, while a functional production representative product is optional.  Submissions may be sent by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  The WPNAC Program encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUB Zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs).  WPNAC is not interested in concepts that have not been developed or proven.  Proposals should be of suitable development and Technical Readiness Levels (TRL) that permit immediate use. All interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  Offerors should submit acceptable white papers prior to 5:00 p.m. on 9 August 2010.  Submittals after this date will still be accepted, although there is no guarantee they will be evaluated.It should be noted that the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government.At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract in connection with this announcement.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.

The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security plays an essential role in ensuring that foreign policy missions are accomplished in a safe and secure environment. The primary mission of surveillance detection services is to enhance the ability of the U.S. mission overseas to recognize potential pre-operational terrorist surveillance directed against its personnel and facilities.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform surveillance detection operations under this contract. Surveillance Detection Operations are discreet and are not to be considered as a replacement for ongoing efforts by others such as members of the Local Guard Force; they will only supplement activities already in place.

Since coordination and cooperation with host country police and/or security forces will be required, it will be essential for the Contractor to recognize any political sensitivity that may arise in the performance of these operations. The Contractor shall be able to adapt the program to accomplish its objectives while easing any concerns by either the Mission or the host country.</p>
<p>The major duties of a Surveillance Detection Specialist include identifying and immediately reporting suspected surveillance of personnel and facilities, providing protective surveillance of U.S. personnel as directed by the Regional Security Officer (RSO) in his/her capacity as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and assisting the RSO in route planning and analysis.</p>

<p>The Government will solicit this requirement using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, and the small business size standard is $18,500,000 in average annual receipts. The Government plans to award one or multiple contracts for these services. The anticipated period of performance is a base year consisting of 12 months of full performance and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours of surveillance detection (SD) operations to be conducted by Surveillance Detection Specialists under this contract at US Consulate Calgary approximately 7,904 hours; US Consulate Winnipeg zero SD hours; US Consulate Quebec City approximately 10,704 hours.

No subcontracting is allowed under this prospective contract for Surveillance Detection Operations which are performed by Surveillance Detection Specialists; however, support services can be subcontracted. All Contractor personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor, including checks on employment history, criminal record, residence, and credit. Additionally for employees who will operate vehicles in performance of these services, the individual's driving record will also be reviewed.

<p>Therefore, any solicitation released for guard services is subject to Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (22 U.S.C. 4864). Each solicitation and contract for guard services includes DOSAR 652.237-73 Statement of Qualifications For Preference As A U.S. Person (APR 2004) as well as a requirement for the Contractor to complete a certification (Statement Of Qualifications For Purposes Of Obtaining Preference As A U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4864) if the Contractor is requesting eligibility for the statutory preference. (See Attachment)</p>
<p>TRANSITION PLAN AND PHASED TAKEOVER:</p>
<p>A timely and smooth transition is of the utmost importance to the Government.</p>
<p>A Preliminary Transition Plan is requested as part of any proposal and is approved at the time of award. A Final Transition Plan is required within ten (10) days of contract award. The transition period shall not exceed ninety (90) calendar days and full performance shall commence at the date specified in the Notice-to-Proceed issued by the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>
<p>An incoming Contractor assumes full responsibility for an orderly phase-in of operations that minimize the impact to the Embassy. Outgoing Contractors develop a Phase-Out Plan for the orderly transition of the operations. The transition procedures shall not disrupt or adversely affect the day-to-day operations of the Consulate and shall result in a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibility to the successor.</p>
<p>The Government prefers that the Contractor begin full performance of the contract requirements on a specific changeover date. Failure of the Contractor to complete transition either within ninety (90) days after contract award or by the start date stated in the Notice-to-Proceed, whichever is later, may be grounds for termination of the contract for default. <br />HOW PROPOSALS WILL BE EVALUATED IF REQUESTED:<br />General Information:</p>
<p>Each proposal must meet all the requirements stated in the solicitation and be prepared in accordance with Section L (Instructions, Conditions and Notices To Offerors). The Government will evaluate acceptable proposals as described in Section M and the Offeror's responsibility in accordance with FAR Part 9. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the technical requirements, (i.e., Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA)).</p>
<p>In order to be considered acceptable and receive a "pass", the Offeror's Technical Proposal must demonstrate the ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. The Government will consider the factors and sub-factors, described in the solicitation in determining acceptability.</p>
<p>The evaluation of each factor and sub-factor will consider completeness and clarity, degree of compliance with the solicitation, and the likelihood that the approach will be successful as proposed. The Government is seeking to determine if the Offeror demonstrates a thorough understanding of the scope and complexity of the work and recognizes the need to protect government property, employees, and the visitors.</p>
<p>The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.<br />Rejection of Offers:<br />The Government reserves the right to reject an offer if one of the following conditions exists:</p>
<p>&bull;Offer fails to submit any of the required proposal documents as required by Section L;<br />&bull;Offer submits a cost/price proposal that cannot be adequately explained or substantiated; and<br />&bull;Offer submits an offer that could not be made technically acceptable without a major re-write.<br />Overall Evaluation:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposals in three phases:</p>
<p>1. Review of the proposal to determine whether it is timely and complies with the instructions in Section L (Instructions, Conditions and Notices To Offerors);<br />2. Technical evaluation to determine the technical acceptability of the offer to the solicitation's technical requirements; and<br />3. A price evaluation to determine the total price proposed by each Offeror, including any applicable U.S. preference.</p>

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

This is a Sources Sought notice for Enterprise Run Time Licenses for developing VistA Imaging applications for use within the VA.  The VA utilizes the Laurel Bridge DICOM Connectivity Framework (DCF) to develop VistA Imaging applications for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities.  Currently, the licensing scheme for a Laurel Bridge Run Time Licenses is for a single-user.  These are permanent licenses tied to a single user by means of linking a license key to each affected VistA Imaging machine's Machine Address Control (MAC) address on the Network Interface Card (NIC).  Given medical device reliability requirements, each VistA Imaging machine is procured with redundant NICs.  Over time, NIC failures are returned for repair and replacement, making the logistics management of these licenses very labor intensive.

The VA seeks an enterprise licensing scheme.  The VA intends to procure a approximately 1000 Enterprise Run Time Licenses for developing VistA Imaging applications that will not be affected by the logistical problems described above; i.e., are not linked to a machine's MAC address on the NIC.  The VA also requires support and maintenance for these licenses.  The enterprise run time license must be equivalent to the Laurel Bridge DICOM Connectivity Framework (DCF) in capability and meet all of the technical requirements identified in Attachment 0001.  

It is requested that any interested party submit the information required below via email to the point of contact listed at this bottom of this announcement.

<DESC>The Sources Sought Notice of the planned extension of the CDTF General Physics contract ordering period was posted on 11 Mar 2010 on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps).  It requested any interested parties provide their interest in the CDTF program, with a description of their capabilities, as it applied to the umbrella statement of work (SOW) requirements.  One response was received and evaluated primarily for technical/management qualifications and capabilities, chemical demilitarization experience and past performance, and operations and maintenance of a government-owned, contractor-operated facility.  Based on this evaluation and analysis, the Government has decided to extend the General Physics contract ordering period in accordance with the regulatory provisions at DFARS 217.204(e)(i) and FAR 6.302-1.  The General Physics contract will be modified accordingly.  The General Physics contract contains an umbrella SOW that will be revised to reflect the overall requirements and capabilities for Stockpile and Non-Stockpile support for the CDTF program.  The length of the ordering period and overall period of performance will also be extended to 30 Sep 2014 and 30 Sep 2015, respectively.  The contractor/contract affected by this is General Physics, Contract W52P1J-04-D-0009.

<DESC><strong>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration</strong>: TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) Study
<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide medications and equipment/supplies required for the treatment of youth with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>: Type 2 diabetes has traditionally been viewed as a disease of adults; however, recent epidemiological data reveal an increasing number of cases of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population, especially among adolescents and in certain minority populations. The increase of type 2 diabetes in youth is presumed to be a consequence of widespread obesity.</p>
<p>The drugs currently approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes have not been systematically studied in children. Thus, treatment options for those children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are restricted by the lack of data on the use of such pharmacological agents. In addition, the adolescent period presents special challenges to health care providers and families when attempting to promote behavior and life style changes, as well as medication adherence. Finally, treatment programs must also consider cultural differences among racial and ethnic groups that may influence acceptance of medical or lifestyle regimens. This is especially important for type 2 diabetes in children, which disproportionately affects minority groups.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The TODAY study is designed to determine the best approach(es) to treating children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. The study, conducted at 15 clinical sites and a coordinating center, recruited 700 youth, ages 10-17 years, who were within two year of diabetes diagnosis. Youth were randomized to one of three arms: metformin, metformin plus rosiglitzaone, and metformin plus an intensive lifestyle change program. TODAY is testing the hypothesis that initial aggressive therapy will provide better glycemic control than traditional, step-wise therapy. This could potentially have long-lasting benefits in adolescents who may be thrown into diabetes by pubertal insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The primary outcome is time to failure, defined as HgbA1c &gt; 8% for 6 months. The intervention phase will end in February 2011.</p>
<p><strong>STUDY GOALS</strong>: The NIDDK plans to maintain the TODAY cohort for at least two years once the intervention has ended, and possibly longer, to study the clinical course of type 2 diabetes in those who develop the disease at an early age, particularly with respect to 1) development of diabetes complications and risk factors for complications, and 2) evolution of beta cell function. To facilitate retention of the cohort and to enable the investigators to examine the long-term effects of original randomization arm, it is desirable to continue to provide diabetes treatment to the TODAY subjects, in as uniform a manner as possible.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with the TODAY study group by providing medications, equipment and supplies required to treat the TODAY subjects. This would include: 1) metformin; 2) insulin; 3) statin; 4) ACE inhibitor; 5) other anti-hypertensives, including thiazide diuretics and ARBs; 6) glucose meter and/or strips; 7) insulin syringes; 8) lancets; 9) urine ketone strips.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</strong>: Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate. Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. Examples of the Clinical Trial Agreement and the CRADA can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/.</p>
<p><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS</strong>: The NIDDK will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in continuation of the TODAY study. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria: <br />1. The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of therapeutic agents including drugs, biologics, and devices in patients with type 2 diabetes and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease management in these patients. <br />2. The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the medication, supplies and/or equipment in a timely manner for the duration of the study. <br />3. A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data. <br />4. The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of type 2 diabetes, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development. <br />5. If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research. <br />6. Must agree to have their preparation used in the above-mentioned TODAY study-developed protocols which will be conducted by the Network and will have data collection and analysis performed by the TODAY study's Data Coordinating Center. <br />7. Must provide IND sponsor of the studies with cross-reference access to a US FDA filing that contains the chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for the drug substance and drug product. <br />8. Adverse event profile from human studies must be provided. <br />9. Must agree to share (with NIDDK and potentially the TODAY study) all safety data from other studies involving their preparation as well as relevant efficacy data from other studies (, etc). <br />10. The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results. <br /><br /><strong>SUBMISSION DATES</strong>: <em>Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before October 1, 2010 will be considered</em>.</p>

Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) has been funded by the USACE Middle East District (TAM) to determine the structural adequacy of the existing airfield pavements to accommodate mission aircraft at Cairo West Air Base, Cairo, Egypt. The proposed schedule is August 12-24, 2010. The structural capacity of the pavements will be determined based on test results from nondestructive testing (NDT) utilizing a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and the NDT evaluation procedures developed by the Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB)<BR><BR>A Dynatest FWD, on loan from the Egyptian Air Force and operated by a Dynatest Contractor will be used to test the airfield pavements at Cairo West AB. However, the Egyptian Air Force (sponsor) requires that an operator from Dynatest Consulting, Inc. be used to conduct testing with their equipment due to previously encountered problems with their device.<BR><BR>In 1989, the Dynatest system was selected by the Army, Air Force and Navy as the primary NDT device for testing airfield pavements. All APB evaluation software to complete analyses of the data collected using the FWD is only compatible with the Dynatest system. <BR><BR>If APBs NDT equipment is required, the estimated cost for shipping one way is $24,000 from Vicksburg, MS to Cairo, Egypt. The shipping office estimated the return cost to be approximately $3,000 more based on past experience. The total estimated cost for shipping APB equipment to and from Cairo, Egypt is $51,000. The above shipping charges are for air freight. Shipping over water is cheaper but unacceptable because of time required for this mode of transportation. <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR A COMMERCIAL ITEM PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. (ii) Solicitation No. BBG50-R-10-xxxx is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) and a contract will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures in FAR Part 15. (iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect from the Federal Acquisition Regulations 2005-041, dated May 13, 2010. (iv) The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541910. (v) The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB), Office of Contracts (CON) located in Washington, D.C. has a requirement, subject to the availability of funding, for a Contractor to conduct music research in the Middle East cities of Amman, Jordan, BEIRUT, LEBANON, Alexandria, Egypt, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Casablanca, Morocco and Baghdad, Iraq. The project will consist of research on the musical tastes and preferences of Arab adults, ages 17-28. Research will be conducted by playing musical excerpts provided by IBB to a sample drawn from the target audience and recording reactions to a brief questionnaire designed to elicit listeners' likes and dislikes, as well as the intensity of their preferences. Contractor shall have demonstrated ability and experience in performing market research and public opinion polling services as outlined herein. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED FIELDWORK: The primary object of this research is to test respondents' familiarity with and reactions to individual musical selections, as identified by brief, easily recognizable excerpts, usually lasting between 5 and 10 seconds in length. Details of required fieldwork are as follows: [1] Contractor shall provide supervision of fieldwork; [2] Music research shall be conducted on a weekly basis in all cities with the exception of Baghdad which shall be conducted on a bi-weekly basis. [3] Sample universe shall be the adult populations between the ages of 17 and 28 (inclusive) of the following cities: Amman, ALEXANDRIA, Abu Dhabi, Casablanca and Baghdad. [4] Contractor shall recruit a fresh sample of 50 respondents each week in each city, except in Baghdad, where a fresh sample of respondents shall be recruited every two weeks. [5] In the initial stage of sampling, recognized probability techniques shall be used to select households for screening to ascertain the presence of eligible household members. In the event that a selected household does not contain any members eligible for this study, or eligible members within the household refuse to participate, successive additional households shall be identified, again based on recognized probability techniques until a substitute respondent has been successfully recruited. In no case shall more than one respondent be drawn from the same household. [6] Screening criteria and quotas: Contractor shall ensure that all respondents fall in the SES categories A, B, C1, or C2, as these categories are commonly defined by market research agencies in the countries concerned. Proportions of each week's sample in each group should roughly follow the underlying population distribution. In no case should the total proportion of A/B individuals in a weekly sample exceed 20%. Each weekly sample should be approximately half male and half female. In addition, approximately half of each weekly sample should be between the ages of 17-22 (inclusive) with the other half between the ages of 23 and 28 (inclusive). All respondents should listen to music at least one hour per week and should listen to music on the radio at least 30 minutes per week. Contractor shall screen all potential respondents for musical preferences. Contractor shall eliminate from the sample all respondents who dislike contemporary Western music. [7] Interviews will take place in the respondent's home, with interviewer playing musical hooks on a CD or tape player provided by the Contractor. [8] Interviewers will employ a questionnaire requiring respondent to indicate familiarity with each song played, as well as favorability rating for each song with which respondent is familiar. Questionnaire will contain up to five minutes of additional questions, to be determined by IBB in consultation with Contractor. [9] Approximately 100 songs shall be tested each week, using hooks to be provided by IBB (with the exception of Baghdad, where the number of songs shall be tested approximately every two weeks). It is expected that weekly compilation of hooks will be provided electronically to contractor as MP3 files. CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES: The Contractor shall be responsible for the project design, drafting, translation, formatting, adaptation and printing of the survey instruments; developing the sample plan and screening procedures; training interviewers, supervising fieldwork; cleaning and encoding survey responses; entering and processing the data; preparing tabulations in data books; submitting data in electronic form, and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner. DELIVERABLES: Results from Amman, Alexandria, Abu Dhabi, BEIRUT, and Casablanca shall be delivered to IBB each week in electronic form. Results from Baghdad shall be delivered to IBB bi-weekly in electronic form. Data shall be presented in a manner that allows analysis by age, gender, and extent of liking for the Western music.

The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB.</p>
<p>A pre-conference planning meeting will be conducted after the contract has been awarded. The appropriate hotel staff will meet with the NLRB's designated personnel in order to establish a time frame and process for planning the conference and finalizing menu selections</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>All offerors must confirm in their proposal that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Evaluation.</p>
<p>These proposal factors are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p><strong>1. Technical Proposal:</strong> <br />(a). Proposal shall be evaluated on the ability to provide all conference requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />(b). Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br />(c). Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session and breakout rooms, location and office space; the atmosphere of the meeting rooms (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking, exercise facility and business center; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br />(d). Location: A maximum 15 minute walking distance to restaurants, entertainment and to a metro stop. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under the technical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Past Performance:</strong> The contractor shall provide a list of three recent contracts that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW. The contact information for each contract shall include:<br />- Contract value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Type of services provided</p>
<p><strong>3. Price Proposal:</strong> This price shall be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Each offeror shall complete the PRICING PROPOSAL, AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>CLIN 001 Hotel Lodging in accordance with this SOW.</p>
<p>CLIN 002 Meeting Space Rental in accordance with this SOW.</p>
<p>CLIN 003 Food and Beverages in accordance with this SOW.</p>
<p>CLIN 004 Audio Visual/Flipchart services in accordance with this SOW.</p>
<p>CLIN 005 Miscellaneous Expenses in accordance with this SOW. (NOT INCLUDING PARKING) The cost of parking will be considered and evaluated in the Technical Evaluation, but will not be charged on the Master Bill.</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; However, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.</p>
<p>In case of a receipt of a large number of proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.</p>
<p>First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><br />a. If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><br />b. If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.</p>
<p>c. After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.</p>
<p>The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE SUBMISSION: <br /></strong>Proposals shall include a Technical Proposal that clearly addresses the requirement of CLIN 001 through CLIN 005 (facility pictures, room dimensions, menu lists, and amenities that support the training) in accordance with this SOW. In addition, a Pricing Proposal utilizing Attachment A shall be included in accordance with this SOW. Past Performance shall be included in accordance with this SOW.</p>
<p>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Technical proposals or otherwise included documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>

Background
The Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP) is a mandatory residential 12-month program designed to attract the most creative, research-oriented medical and dental students to the intramural campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.  Participants, known as fellows, spend a year engaged in a mentored clinical or translational research project.  All participants are expected to live in our assigned residential housing.  Fellows live adjacent to campus in furnished apartments Bethesda, Maryland.  
The apartments are two-bedroom, two-bathroom leased for two fellows to share, along with one-bedroom and one-bathroom apartments leased for couples.  The CRTP Fellows have been living in these apartments since 1998.  The apartments will need to have professional cleaning services to keep, sanitize and maintain the appearance of the apartments.  
The individualized program is developed for fellows, who attend clinics, see patients on the wards, and work with a principal investigator in laboratories on selected clinical research projects.  Fellows are given an opportunity to learn about translational research from bench to bedside and back to bench; they attend lectures on clinical research; and they participate in an interactive, group learning experience with the members of the class and leading NIH physicians and scientists.  Fellows collaborate closely with one another and with leading clinical investigators on the intramural NIH campus. 
The CC has been approved by the NIH Space Review Board to use Building 15D2 for on-campus housing for a new Sabbatical Program that has just been launched.  The housing will be offered to those accepted into the pilot program who will be doing 212 month studies at the NIH.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N7140100037 is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to provide chemical treatment of Kudzu (Pueraria montana) infestations at various locations along the Mississippi portion of the Natchez Trace Parkway (NATR) and Vicksburg National Military Park (VICK) during one spring-summer and one summer-fall period. The Contractor shall furnish all necessary vehicles, personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities
The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.  The applicable NAICS number is 115112 and a small business size standard is 500 employees.  This is Total Small Business Set Aside procurement.  
SCOPE OF WORK - Exotic pest plants are species of plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an area outside of their natural range.  The invasion of exotic pest plants is one of the many serious threats facing the Natchez Trace Parkway and Vicksburg National Military Park today. If exotic pest plants are not actively managed or controlled, the integrity of floral and faunal resources is at risk of significant degradation or loss.  
A member of the Pea or bean family (Fabaceae), Kudzu is an exotic plant species first brought to the United States from China around 1876, primarily to control erosion but also to provide cattle an additional forage plant. It is a highly aggressive, semi-woody perennial vine capable of growing 60 feet per year. The result is a dense blanket of foliage that chokes out both woody and herbaceous native vegetation, resulting in large-scale alternation of natural communities. Kudzu leaves are alternate and compound, with each of three leaflets entire or deeply 2-3 lobed and with hairy margins.  Flowers are purple, fragrant, about 0.5 inches long, and resemble pea flowers in shape.
Management Guidelines and AuthoritiesNPS management policies mandate the control of exotic species up to and including total eradication when practical or whenever such species threaten protection or interpretation of resources being preserved on NPS lands. 
Authorities to control exotic plants on park lands include but are not limited to the following Public Laws and Federal Regulations:(1)  Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, Public Law 94-579;(2)  Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat 388(3)  The "Carlson-Folry Act" Public Law 90-583(4)  Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, Public Law 93-629, as amended.(5)  Endangered Species Act. Public Law 93-205, as amended.(6)  National Park Service Organic Act, 39 Stat. 535(7)  Departmental Manual, Pesticide Use Policy, 517(8)  Executive Orders: 11514, 11738, and 11987.
Project Locations and DescriptionOver 100 acres of Kudzu have been mapped in the Mississippi portion of the Natchez Trace Parkway.  This 100+ acre total is contained in 20 or so discreet locations spread out over 250 miles. Each infestation ranges in size from about 1/4 acre to 25 acres. Approximately 30 acres of Kudzu are located within Vicksburg National Military Park (NMP), with infestations ranging from 1/10 acre to 10 acres. Primary focus will be on the treatment of the larger infestations located at Vicksburg NMP and the large 1+ acre infestations located in the Mississippi portions of the Natchez Trace Parkway.  Funding availability may limit the amount of infestation that can be treated.  Thus, the Kudzu acreage available to be treated under this SOW will be located at ten or more sites between Natchez, MS and the Alabama state line and within Vicksburg NMP (see attached maps) and not exceed 100 acres in total. Upon award of contract, more detailed maps delineating each infestation to be treated shall be made available to the contractor.
Phase I consists of an initial spring-summer (May/June 2011) herbicide and mechanical treatment of Kudzu present in each treatment area. Mechanical treatment should proceed the chemical treatment, and consist of cutting all Kudzu vines growing up the sides of trees. Each vine should be cut and the lower portion stump (basally) treated with Garlon.  Foliar herbicide application can then proceed; making sure to treat all vines pulled to the ground.   
Phase II consists of the re-treatment of all Phase I sites in the Summer/Fall (August/September 2011).  Phase II may not involve a mechanical treatment.   	Treatment MethodsHerbicide application shall be the primary control method used.  The method of herbicide application is currently restricted to direct plant (foliar) and cut stump applications.
Herbicide Use and ApprovalThe National Park Service (NPS) / Department of the interior (DOI) has approved Transline and Garlon for treating Kudzu at NATR and VICK.  Transline is selective for Legumes only and will minimally impact non-target, native plant species in the treated areas. Garlon 4 or chemical equivalent shall be used for cut stump applications unless Garlon 3A or chemical equivalent is indicated by the presence of surface water. Garlon 3A shall be used for foliar applications at all sites along the Natchez Trace Parkway and Vicksburg National Military Park (VICK) where surface water is present.  The NPS will specify areas where Transline foliar applications are desired in lieu of Galon 3A in order to preserve desirable grass cover.   If the contractor wishes to utilize herbicides other than Transline or Garlon , the contractor shall submit a pesticide use proposal to the BITH Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) at least two weeks prior to expected application. When a Pesticide Use Proposal is submitted, convincing evidence of the effectiveness and safety of the proposed treatment in a habitat similar to that found at NATR and VICK shall accompany the proposal.  After reviewing the supporting documents submitted by the contractor, the contracting officer shall approve or disapprove, or require the submission of additional data that may be required to make a decision. 
The contractor shall be requested to possess all chemical applicators licenses, certificates of training and permits required by the state of Mississippi.  Evidence of this documentation shall be presented to the COTR prior to initiating on the ground control efforts. Use of chemicals on NPS lands shall strictly adhere to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, manufacturers label directions, state of Mississippi pesticide laws and NPS regulations to include label restrictions for use over standing water.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shall conform to label requirements.
Foliar ApplicationAll herbicide formulations utilized will include a dye (red dye preferred) in order to facilitate determination of treated areas.  The herbicide formulation for Kudzu control shall be per label directions for foliar applications. Applications cannot be made when winds exceed 10 mph, if rain is expected within four hours or where adjacent native vegetation could be subjected to damage by spray drift.
Data CollectionThe ground crew supervisor is responsible for collecting the following daily data: Kudzu location named location at Vicksburg NMP or nearest tenth of a mile along the Natchez Trace Parkway, treatment date, herbicide formulation and volume used, number of applicators, and hours worked.  This information will be supplied daily to the NPS Exotic Plant Management Team (EPMT) Crew Leader in charge.  
Supplies and EquipmentThe contractor will be responsible for providing herbicide applicators with all supplies and equipment for exotic plant (Kudzu) control including vehicles, herbicide, herbicide dyes and adjuvants, sprayers, hand tools, gloves, safety equipment etc.  
Field Personnel Qualifications Crew Members and supervisors: All personnel performing exotic plant control operations shall posses the following minimum qualifications. 1.Ability to correctly identify Kudzu in the field.2.Ability to mix, handle, and apply herbicides in accordance with label directions and crew supervisor instructions.3.Ability to handle and maintain tools, equipment, and supplies in good working order for daily operations.4.Ability to work under adverse environmental conditions including: high humidity and temperatures, inclement weather, exposure to poisonous plants and reptiles and biting insects, and difficult terrain (steep slopes and dense thickets).

STATEMENT-OF-WORK (SOW)
A.  Overview
This statement identifies "supplies and services" to provide an on-site maintenance agreement for Government owned assets, at Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRC-SW), PO Box 357058, San Diego, CA 92135-7058. The primary Period-of-Performance (POP) shall be 01-October-2010, through 30- September-2011. Additionally, the Government reserves the right to exercise THREE (03 EA) subsequent Option Periods. Upon request of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resumes of corporate personnel for the purpose of ascertaining their qualifications, relative to the terms and conditions stipulated herein. Maintenance and repair services shall include: all travel, accommodations, labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the work.   
The agreement will provide annual maintenance services to establish a leak-free system and supporting "Letter of Certification," attesting to operational compliance with the Environmental Protective Agency (EPA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), and/or San Diego Air Pollution Control District (APCD). In particular, the work, associated with the performance of this order, shall facilitate "Leak-Free" Status and Certification, in compliance with California (CALIF) O.S.H.A., Regulation #5143 (a) 5. 
B.  Service Requirements and Performance
Services shall provide basic equipment cleaning, the inspection and/or identification of components for wear, lubrication, adjustment, and testing that is commensurate with maintaining and/or restoring operation and function to the designed and engineered parameters of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). 
The Contractor shall schedule all services requiring "on-site" visitation by corporate personnel with the Designated Government Representative (DGR) cited in the order, a minimum of FORTY-EIGHT (48 EA) Hours in advance of their anticipated arrival. Oversight or failure to meet this requirement has the potential to delay the receipt of required "Contractor Authorization" and contribute to further equipment downtime. Additionally, and for purposes of clarification, this is the only Government representative, in addition to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist or Purchasing Agent, who is authorized to place service calls to your company.  
Services are to be performed Monday through Friday (excluding federal holidays or shutdown period),during the hours of 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM, local time. Work schedules that are influenced by either afederal holiday or shutdown period will be initiated or resumed on the next regularly scheduled workday, of the Government. The Contractor shall provide all test equipment, including: tools, diagnostic and alignment devices, meters, hardware, software, etc., needed to complete the work. C.  Leak-Free Testing and Letter of Certification  
The work associated with the performance of this order, shall facilitate "Leak-Free" Status and Certification, in compliance with California (CALIF) O.S.H.A., Regulation #5143 (a) 5. The Contractor shall undertake and complete a confined space entry flood leak test and certification procedure, during either the "second or third" Week, of July. The application will entail Measurement of Mechanical Ventilation Equipment: 27000 acfm airflow per Pilot Traverse Method, as required. It is duly noted, the dynamics of operating said equipment require "due diligence" on behalf of FRC-SW, and that the Contractor cannot guarantee or warranty (either expressed or implied) the equipment will continue to operate mechanically correct or leak-free after the original date of certification. Identified maintenance necessities will include: all preparation costs, adjustment of components, sealing of doors, man-ways, hatches, etc., and a coordinated shutdown of the system prior to testing, and the test itself.  Work completion shall be achieved within SEVENTY-TWO (72 EA) Hours, following the arrival of the field-service technician. The only exceptions to this requirement will be for extenuating circumstancesthat are considered beyond the immediate control of "maintenance and/or service" personnel, and to be reasonable or prudent within industry standards. 
D.  Off-Site Repair
Should circumstances develop wherein the Contractor is unable to specify the extent of repairs needed, the Contractor is authorized to take the equipment "off-site" for repair, with approval from the Designated Government Representative (DGR). The equipment shall be repaired, and returned, within FIVE (05 EA) Business Days. If repairs cannot be completed within the allotted timeframe, it shall become incumbent upon the Contractor to notify the FRC-SW DGR, in a timely manner, of the new delivery date.
E.  Field Service Reports

F.   Replacement Parts
The purchase of replacement parts will require prior approval and the award of a separate purchase order, or One-Time (1X) procurement via a Government Purchase Card (GPC). In the event such items are formally requested by the Government, they must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) standards, and be of equivalent quality.
G.  Instruction/Guidance for Additional Supplies/Services   
Should the Contractor be confronted with uncertainty related to performance, or have knowledge of a necessity that has not been previously identified within the limitations of this negotiated agreement, the Contractor is instructed to immediately notify the cited DGR of a potential disparity in requirements, which may adversely impact the ability of the Contractor to provide requested and/or identified supplies or services. In the event of the unavailability of the DGR, wherein modification of this order may either be indicated or implied, the Contractor shall not undertake any additional actions without the receipt of written approval from the Contracting Officer, at the Fleet & Industrial Supply Center San Diego (FISCSD). 
H.  Termination and Unused Portion

In the event that such actions are required, all related correspondence and/or documentation will be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer, at the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center San Diego (FISCSD).

<p><br />COAL MINING PROCESS TECHNICAL REVIEW SUPPORT</p>
<p><br />I. Introduction</p>
<p>On April 2, 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region III (EPA) published and sought public comment on a proposal under the Clean Water Act to restrict or prohibit discharges associated with mountain top mining at the Spruce No. 1 surface mine in Logan County, West Virginia. Additional information about the Spruce No. 1 mine and EPA's proposal can be found at http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/spruce1.html. Additional information about existing mining practices, policies, and regulations can be found at http://www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/guidance/mining.html.</p>
<p>II. Objective:</p>
<p>In order to support EPA's review of this project, EPA is seeking support in performing a technical assessment of potential alternative mining practices at the Spruce project site. The contractor shall assist in the analysis and/or evaluation of alternative designs that have the potential to minimize environmental impacts at the project site.</p>

The contractor shall track and report expenditures by task to allow accurate accounting of activities. All deliverable products under this contract are the property of EPA.</p>
<p>Task #1 - Spruce No. 1 Project Scoping <br />1.1 An initial scoping conference call will be convened by the COR within seven (7) calendar days of contract award. <br />1.2 Contract review calls will occur weekly with the COR to confirm the status of tasks and discuss any scoping issues.<br /><br />Estimated level of effort: 50 hours</p>
<p>Task #2: Review and Evaluation of Alternatives for Spruce <br />At the direction of the COR, the contractor shall review the authorized Spruce No. 1 mine design and construction method and provide a technical assessment. Review may include one or more of the following categories of project assessment related to potential alternatives and minimization techniques that would result in less environmental resource impacts at the project site:<br /><br />&bull; Alternative potential project locations within a given area defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential project site designs to meet needs defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential project construction sequence and/or methods defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential waste and wastewater treatment methods defined by EPA.</p>
<p>All review of potential project alternatives shall include estimates of cost and level of extraction and/or extraction efficiency for the proposed alternatives. All review of potential project alternatives also shall include a review of each alternative's "practicability" as defined at 40 CFR Section 230.10(a)(2) "An alternative is practicable if it is as available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes." The term "cost" should be considered as including the cost of constructing the alternatives compared to the project as currently authorized under the issued Clean Water Act Section 404 permit and the impact of each alternative to the economic viability of the project as a coal extraction activity.</p>
<p>EPA will provide the background materials on the project and the alternatives to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Estimated level of effort: 500 hours</p>
<p>Task #3: Comment Review and Evaluation<br />At the direction of the COR, the contractor shall review EPA selected comments submitted by the public in response to EPA's Proposed Determination on Spruce No. 1 and provide EPA with a technical assessment of the comments as they relate to mine design and construction methods, including alternative potential project locations, site designs, construction sequence and/or methods, and/or waste and wastewater treatment methods. The technical assessment shall include evaluation and estimates of cost, level of extraction and/or extraction efficiency, and practicability of alternatives discussed and/or proposed in the comments.</p>
<p>Estimated level of effort: 200 hours</p>
<p>Task #4: Report <br />The contractor shall prepare a report including the review and analysis of the Spruce project, potential alternative designs, and comments on the Spruce Proposed Determination as discussed above detailing technical recommendations, cost estimates of alternatives, and the practicability of minimizing environmental impacts at the project site.<br />The contractor shall submit a draft report no later than fourteen days (14) before the final report is due. EPA comments on draft report shall identify whether additional information is needed. <br /><br />Estimated level of effort: 400 hours</p>
<p>Task #5: Option for Continuing Review<br />The contractor shall be available to respond to questions and/or comments on any proposed alternative designs and costs from Task 2 and provide technical recommendations on potential project design changes as a result of this alternatives analysis. <br /><br />Estimated level of effort: 1,000 hours</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quote (RFQ) number SECHQ1-10-Q-0082 is assigned to this requirement.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently concluded an acquisition for XBRL analytic services, and desires to obtain additional XBRL capability through commercially available subscription services.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519190 and the business size standard is $6.5 Million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is not applicable.

A.  Statement of Government Need

Through this synopsis/solicitation, the SEC intends to enter into one or more commercial subscription agreements for vendor-hosted XBRL data and analytic services.  The SEC anticipates entering into more than one subscription agreement under this solicitation, but reserves the right to enter into only one agreement or make no award.  The service(s) will be used primarily by SEC staff who do not have a technology background, though they may be familiar with spreadsheet-style applications. 
 
At minimum, the data set accessed through the service must include all public XBRL filings submitted to the SEC via the EDGAR disclosure system since 30 June 2009.  This data set must be available at the time Offeror responds to this solicitation.  Going forward, the service must add XBRL data and exhibits subsequently filed with the SEC to the repository on a timely basis.  The cost of maintaining a complete, up-to-date set of XBRL filings must be included in the pricing proposal.  Offerors are encouraged to provide access to additional publicly available interactive data files (e.g. XML, XBRL) from the SEC such as the Forms 3/4/5 and the Mutual Funds Risk/Return Forms (starting in December 2010), and from other U.S. Government sources such as the FDIC.

The Offerors service must be accessible via the Internet.  It must have an intuitive and user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing the services data via any computer connected to the Internet through a standard browser (e.g., Internet Explorer), an application plug-in, or both.  The service should provide robust analysis and reporting features that will maximize the utility to the SEC of interactive SEC filing data.  The Offeror must keep the associated technologies, data, and services up-to-date with relevant technology standards, and must keep the methodology (of searches and data requests), stored searches and analyses, and search and analysis history, secure and up-to-date.

Solicitation number FCCRFQ100000QRD5 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This procurement is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-42. This RFQ is issued unrestricted under NAICS code 519130. The size standard is $25 million. <br />2. The following contract line item number (CLIN) is included in this RFQ:
<p>CLIN 0001: Provide Television Program Scheduling Data in accordance with paragraphs a through e below.<br />1 JB ________<br />Pricing: Vendors shall provide Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes.</p>
<p>a. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is conducting a Quadrennial Review of its media ownership regulations. For this Quadrennial Review, the FCC requires television program scheduling data for four one-week periods, one each during the months of November 2007, May 2008, November 2009, and May 2010. The specific dates are: November 8-14, 2007, May 1-7, 2008, November 5-11, 2009, and May 6-12, 2010. Contractor shall provide complete program scheduling data for each of these periods for every United States full-power television broadcast station in Contractor's database (each station to be identified by call sign, channel number, and Designated Market Area), subject to a minimum requirement to provide data for 1,625 or more United States full-power television stations. The 1,625 station minimum shall apply to United States full power television stations' primary program streams (see subparagraph b. below). The data provided shall include, at a minimum, the program name, the time it airs, the program genre (the genre choices must include separately "news" and "public affairs" or equivalent terms), the program source (i.e., network, local, syndicated, other), and a program description. <br />b. Every full-power television broadcast station in the United States now transmits its programming digitally. Some of these stations transmit more than one program stream simultaneously. The primary programming stream is generally identified by the station call letters, e.g., WXYZDT. Additional programming streams are generally identified by adding number to the call letters. Thus, if WXYZDT transmitted three programming streams, they would be designated as WXYZDT, WXYZDT2, and WXYZDT3. The streams designated WXYZDT2 and WXYZTVDT3 may be referred to as "multicast program streams." For the November 2007, May 2008 and November 2009 designated weeks, Contractor shall provide program scheduling information, as specified in paragraph a, for the primary program stream only for all US full power television broadcast stations in Contractor's database. For the May 2010 designated week, Contractor shall provide program scheduling information, as specified in paragraph a, for all program streams, including multicast program streams, provided by all US full power television broadcast stations in Contractor's database.<br />c. Contractor shall provide a detailed description of the database delivered including, for each data file, the name of the file and complete field specifications, listing for each record, the field number, the field name, the field length, the field description, and a list of definitions of terms used in the record (e.g., a list of program genres and sources). <br />d. Data Rights: Notwithstanding any other term or condition in any attachment or addendum, the Contractor grants to the Government and the authors preparing statistical studies on the Government's behalf as part of the Quadrennial Review (the "Authors"), subject to the Authors' agreement to non-disclosure restrictions, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to use television program scheduling data delivered to the Government (the "Data") for the purposes of supporting the official business of the Government and the Authors' academic work, but not for any commercial purpose. The Government and the Authors may: (1) reproduce and distribute the Data internally and prepare derivative works for internal use; (2) publicly cite limited, insubstantial portions of the Data; (3) prepare and publish derivative works, including statistical analyses, that utilize the Data but do not include publication of the underlying Data, with appropriate citation to the source; and (4) release the Data to a federal court if directed by a court order. In addition, during the pendency of the FCC's Quadrennial Review proceeding, the Government may make available to the public and the peer reviewers for each study, for the sole purpose of evaluating the Authors' studies, compiled data sets prepared by the Authors that include the some or all of the Data, subject to the following limitations: compiled data sets shall be made available to peer reviewers subject to the terms of a non-disclosure agreement, which shall prohibit use of the Data for any commercial purpose; and compiled data sets shall be made available to the public for the sole purpose of allowing members of the public to comment upon the Authors' studies and subject to the terms and conditions of an FCC protective order, which shall prohibit use of the Data for any commercial purpose. Except to the extent expressly stated herein, the above data rights shall continue indefinitely with respect to the Data.<br />e. The data described above shall be delivered to the FCC within two (2) weeks of the issuance of a purchase order by the FCC.<br /><br />Provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition with the following addenda: Vendors should submit: (1) a complete list of all US full power television stations in Vendor's database, identified by call sign; (2) a description of Vendor's database including, for each data file, the name of the file and field specifications, listing for each record, the field number, the field name, the field length, the field description, and a list of definitions of terms used in the record (e.g., a list of program genres and sources).

Vendors shall submit their quote via email to: Bridget.Gauer@FCC.gov no later than the response date stated in this notice. Please ensure you include the solicitation number in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) the total number of stations for which data is available; (2) the distribution across DMAs of the stations available <br />Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with no addendum.

<p>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria (GFATM) is a global public private partnership which was created in 2002 to dramatically increase resources to fight HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, and to direct those resources to areas of greatest need. Governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities partner to implement programs and work in close collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral organizations to supplement existing efforts dealing with the three diseases. The USG contributes to the GFATM through PEPFAR, and has provided about 27% of all GFATM contributions. The USG therefore has a great interest in the success of GFATM grants. It is important to state that, though the GFATM Liaison position will be funded through PEPFAR, s/he will be actively engaged in improving the performance and management of GFATM grants in all three diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria).</p>
<p>GFATM in Central Asia</p>
<p>The five Central Asian Republics have current approved funding for 24 grants totaling $287 million. In some countries, problems with program management, conflicts of interest and accountability have resulted in program audits and rejection of several Round 10 grant proposals. Recent failures of key countries to meet the GFATM's six CCM minimum requirements highlight the need for the CCM to reassess their structures and modes of operation. Frequent issues noted by the GFATM Secretariat include basic CCM structure, representation and governance.</p>
<p>Recent GFATM audits in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have highlighted shortfalls in decision-making and leadership which affect program performance. Many CAR governments view the CCM as a government project management unit (PMU), rather than a broadly representative oversight body, and the majority of CCM members are Ministers and senior government officials. The Chair of several of the CCMs is the Deputy Prime Minister. In many countries, CCM members do not have sufficient technical understanding of the diseases their programs are meant to address, nor do they have time to conduct real program oversight and informed decision-making. GFATM requirements for CCM composition are well-known and have been presented to all CCMs, though in many cases they are not met. Historical leniency in country grant oversight by the GFATM Secretariat is now becoming more stringent and several countries are finding it very difficult to make the needed adjustments to their grant management behavior. Other challenges to grant implementation include ongoing issues of management deficiencies in grant implementation, limited civil society involvement, and restrictive government policies. Most problems faced by the CCMs (including those rendering them ineligible for funding) are resolvable or could be assisted with minimal outside technical assistance. One challenge is that once grants are awarded, CCMs and Principal Recipients (PRs) rarely request or want involvement of international partners to assist with grant implementation or monitoring. In recent months, more countries are now making use of available technical assistance.</p>
<p>B) BASIC FUNCTION</p>
<p>Most of the Chiefs of Mission (COM) in the five countries have limited engagement or knowledge of the GFATM, its goals, and implementation challenges in each country. While each USG point of contact has provided Global Fund briefings to the COM, more could be done to increase COM engagement in order to strengthen host country commitment and involvement. The Regional Global Fund Liaison will help to elevate the importance of the success of the Global Fund through more routine communication with COMs and technical support to USG points of contact to strengthen COM awareness of the Global Fund in each country.</p>
<p>The USG (represented by USAID) is a member of the CCM in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The USG has provided technical assistance to writing proposals in all countries and provided feedback in the USG's parallel review of the proposals. The USG is a member of the GFATM Board and is involved in important policy decisions.</p>
<p>The USG in CAR recently completed its first PEPFAR Regional Operational Plan (ROP) which will guide future USG HIV/AIDS activities in the region. The PEPFAR team has established ambitious targets which can only be achieved with well-functioning GFATM and national HIV programs in all countries. The plan therefore includes providing intensive assistance to governments and GFATM PRs to improve grant performance and efficiency. The role of the Regional Global Fund Liaison will be to find ways of leveraging and improving the performance of these much larger Global Fund grants.</p>
<p>The USG is in the process of launching several new projects, which are intended to work closely with and provide technical assistance to improve GFATM grant implementation. The Regional Global Fund Liaison will help identify areas and activities to which these projects can provide targeted technical assistance and support.</p>
<p>The Central Asia Regional GFATM Liaison will work under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassadors to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and under the day-to-day oversight of the PEPFAR Regional Coordinator in Kazakhstan, as part of the USG PEPFAR Team in Central Asia. This position will be administratively hired and managed by the USAID Regional Office in Almaty. In accordance with USAID rules and regulations governing its programs and operations, USAID shall administer most administrative and human resource requirements of the Regional Global Fund Liaison, including but not limited to, payroll, personnel files, managing the USAID contractor evaluation process, and any required formal approval of travel. The Regional PEPFAR Coordinator will provide day-to-day oversight of the selected individual.</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. SPONSOR: Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB)</p>
<p>2. PROJECT NUMBER: AUD 07092010 HH</p>
<p>3. PROJECT TITLE: Recovery -&nbsp;Annual Financial Auditing Services</p>

<p>5. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) was established by Public Law 111-5 to coordinate and conduct oversight of funds distributed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or the Recovery Act) in order to identify fraud, waste, abuse, and/or mismanagement. The RATB includes a Chairman, appointed by the President, and 12 Inspectors General (IG) with authority to provide oversight and promote transparency of the expenditure of ARRA funds at all levels of government. The Recovery Act identified 6 specific functions to be performed by the 13-member Board culminating in "flash, quarterly and annual" reports to the President and the Congress. <br /><br />6. SCOPE AND EFFECT</p>
<p>The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 requires federal agencies not covered by the CFO Act to obtain annual audits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, generally accepted auditing standards, and Government Auditing Standards ("Yellow Book"), which produces financial statements, notes to financial statements, a comment on the effectiveness of internal control, and comments on compliance with laws and regulations.</p>
<p>7. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>The purpose of this Blanket Purchase Agreement contract is to obtain financial auditing services for the RATB for fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>8. SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>Task - Audit of Financial Statements</p>
<p>Financial statements are prepared by General Services Administration, Heartland Finance Center, Kansas City, Kansas, in accordance with OMB Bulletin No. 97-01, Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS), and the remainder of the hierarchy of accounting standards comprising the Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting (OCBOA), as this term is defined by AICPA.</p>
<p>The audit should be performed according to generally accepted auditing standards as issued by AICPA; generally accepted government auditing standards as set forth in Government Auditing Standards, 1994 Revision (Yellow Book); and OMB Bulletins No. 93-06 and 98-08, Audit Requirements of Federal Financial Statements (or its successor).</p>
<p>Planning Phase</p>
<p>The Planning Phase shall include a high level review of the agency's organization, controls and risks. The Contractor shall gain an understanding of, and document, the agency's internal control structure including the control environment, control procedures, and accounting systems.</p>
<p>Internal Control Phase</p>
<p>The Internal Control Phase shall provide an understanding of the elements of the agency's internal control structure and how the assessment of this structure is used in performing the financial statement audit. The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining sufficient, reliable audit evidence as to whether the Board's internal control structure provides reasonable assurance of achieving internal control objectives.</p>
<p>Substantive Phase</p>
<p>The Substantive Phase shall consist of detailed tests to form conclusions about whether financial statement amounts are reliable, accurate, complete, and include all disclosures. The Contractor shall perform some degree of substantive testing on all account balances. <br />The level of testing required will be dependent on the degree or reliance being placed upon the internal controls that affect the accounts.</p>
<p>Reporting Phase</p>
<p>The Report Phase shall be the culmination of all work that is performed during the audit. The Contractor will follow up as needed, develop overall conclusions and communicate them to management. <br /><br />Also, perform several quality control functions, as well as prepare reports. The audit report shall be made up of at least the following three parts:</p>
<p>A. A complete overall analytical review of procedures, making sure that the Board is in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards (AICPA, GAO, and OMB).<br />B. A report on internal controls which conforms with the requirements of Government Auditing Standards and OMB Bulletin 93-06 Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statement's.<br />C. A report on the agency's compliance with applicable laws and regulations.<br />D. Potential audit findings should be discussed with the appropriate personnel throughout the course of the audit.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, if applicable, provide a written management letter of suggestions for improvement for those matters which are not considered to be material weaknesses or reportable conditions in the agency's internal control structure.</p>
<p>Audit Management</p>
<p>In performing the audit, the Contractor shall adhere to the following:</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall arrange entrance and exit conferences to be attended by key agency officials. The entrance conference provides an opportunity for the Contractor to discuss the overall audit approach with agency officials. The exit conference provides an opportunity for the Contractor to discuss the results of the audit.</p>
<p>B. During the course of the audit, and in the progress reports in the form of briefings, the Contractor shall discuss the status of the audit, including the progress to date compared with the audit plan and time scheduled or any problems the Contractor has encountered or that have come to the Contractor's attention that <br />could impact the opinion on the financial statements, the report on internal controls, the report on compliance with laws and regulation or completion of agreed upon tasks or the due date of deliverables.</p>
<p>C. It is the responsibility of the Board's Administrative Officer to ensure that all records are available, all accounting entries and adjustments are made, and all other necessary steps are taken to make it possible for the audit firm to perform the work necessary to be able to present the final audit report no later than (NLT) 45 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>D. The Contractor shall, at the conclusion of the audit, provide hard copy of all working papers, drafts and final reports which become the property of the agency.</p>
<p>E. The Contractor's work papers shall be subject to access and review by the GAO and any other oversight organization deemed appropriate by the agency or the contracting offices' technical representative (COTR).</p>
<p>At the completion of the audit, the Contractor shall hold an exit conference with the Board officials to communicate the findings and recommendations developed during the audit.</p>

<p>The Offeror shall provide a Deliverables Schedule showing interim milestones as part of their solution. Final delivery shall be NLT 45 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The schedule for performance of the audit should meet OMB and AICPA requirements. Specifically, OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, revised June 10, 2009, requires the audit to be completed 45 days from the close of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>This schedule shall include, as a minimum, the following:</p>

The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An vendor within the United States may contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at: http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.<br />Any vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless the vendor is exempted in accordance FAR 4.1102, by submission of an quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 12.602(a) and FAR 13.106-2, the following is provided:<br />EVALUATION<br />(a) The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the vendor whose quotation conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price<br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.<br />(b) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowledgement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>SCOPE:<br />CONTRACTOR TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE OFFICE OF SHORE FORCES (CG-7411) TRAINING FOR OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF INSPECTION COURSE</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:<br />PLEASE SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this project, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration and demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a brief (20 pages or less) Technical and Cost Proposal by 12:00 PM, ET, JULY 16, 2010. Technical proposals must include: (1) Specific approach in meeting requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and compatibility of system/process with existing agency configuration. (2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number). References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability. (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. <br />Cost Proposal: provide Firm Fixed-Price "broken out by labor hours, labor category, materials, and other direct costs". Offerors must submit an original and one copy of the proposal to MARY PRICE, USCG SILC DETACHMENT WASHINGTON, Room B411, 2100 Second St. SW, Washington, DC 20593. Electronic transmissions to MARY.E.PRICE@USCG.MIL are acceptable, but must be timely.</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will be evaluated based on two criteria: (1) technical merit and (2) cost/price. Technical evaluations will be based on how the following subfactors are addressed in the proposal:</p>
<p>Subfactor A: Overall Mission Understanding. The proposal must demonstrate understanding of the processes and procedures required for performing training support services for the Coast Guard's Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examiner Course.<br />Subfactor B: Proposed Management Plan. The proposal must demonstrate understanding of the task order objectives and deliverables required.<br />Subfactor C: Quality Assurance.

The proposal must demonstrate present and past performance as it relates to the current proposal.</p>
<p>The second evaluation factor is cost/price. The Government may be willing to pay more than their estimated cost if a proposal's advantages warrant it. However, as technical merit ratings equalize, price may become the deciding factor. Proposed costs and fees for all years will be evaluated as the total price proposal.</p>
<p><br />The following Federal Acquisition Regulations clauses are incorporated by reference: <br />FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (NOV 2007).<br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2007)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Feb 2008)<br />52.222-3 Convict Labor (June 2003) (E.O. 11755).<br />52.222-19 Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (Feb 2008) (E.O. 13126).<br />52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999).<br />52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Sept 2006) (38 U.S.C. 4212).<br />52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (Jun 1998).<br />52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3332).</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />Description/Work Statement<br />Title of Project: Behavioral and Serologic Surveillance of Long Distance Truck Drivers and their Assistants in Angola <br />1 Background and Need <br />Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. CDC collaborates with U.S. government PEPFAR partners, host governments, Ministries of Health, non-governmental organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector to achieve this goal. <br />To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC: <br />&bull; Builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related <br />surveillance systems and surveys; and assists and train countries on how to analyze, <br />disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data. <br />&bull; Develops tools, guidelines, recommendations, and policies to translate research for <br />improved planning and program implementation. <br />&bull; Evaluates and implements novel approaches for conducting surveillance and surveys. <br />Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that BSS be conducted with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Luanda, long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces, and young women involved in transactional sex in the border region of Cunene. <br />This request for contract is to conduct a BSS among long distance truck drivers in Luanda and Cunene. <br />Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV. <br />2 Project Objectives <br />To assist the Government of Angola in understanding the HIV epidemic among long distance truck drivers, CDC will support a behavioral and serological surveillance (BSS) baseline survey for the targeted population. <br />The objectives of the survey are:</p>
<p>1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among <br />truck drivers; <br />2) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence among truck drivers; and <br />3) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys <br />among most at risk populations for HIV. <br />This information collected will be used by program managers and planners to develop and improve HIV prevention and care programs for the target population. <br />3 Scope of Work <br />BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Protocol Development, <br />&bull; Develop a comprehensive, cross-cutting protocol that includes behavioral and serologic data collection among long distance truck drivers and their assistants in Luanda and Cunene. <br />&bull; Obtain required Institutional Review Board approvals or exemptions.</p>
<p><br />Phase 2: Survey Implementation, <br />&bull; Recruit long distance truck drivers and their assistants to participate in the survey. <br />&bull; Conduct in-depth interviews with eligible survey participants. <br />&bull; Provide HIV counseling and testing services. <br />&bull; Collect and test syphilis and HIV specimen. <br />&bull; Provide clinical services and referrals for participants with positive test results and participants <br />with complaints of STIs. <br />&bull; Follow-up with participants that have reactive tests results. <br />&bull; Pay participant allowances.</p>
<p><br /><br />Phase 3: Data Management and Analysis <br />&bull; Analyze both quantitative and quality data collected. <br />&bull; Summarize analyses.</p>
<p><br /><br />Phase 4: Dissemination of Results <br />&bull; Prepare a final written report of the survey. <br />&bull; Disseminate information, in writing and orally, to interested stakeholders.</p>
<p><br />Continuous: Capacity Building <br /><br />&bull; Share tools with host government epidemiology staff. <br />&bull; Include appropriate representatives of the host government on the study team. <br />&bull; Provide training.</p>
<p>4 Technical Requirements</p>
<p>Phase 1: Protocol Development (90 days) <br />Subjects and Methods <br />Use a cross-sectional design for the survey of long distance truck drivers and their assistants; include biological testing for syphilis and HIV with an interviewer-administered questionnaire. <br />Include only truckers and their assistants who travel with them will be included in the survey if aged 18 or over and who have travelled across provinces or internationally. Use a systematic sampling method to sample trucks passing at four data collection points, the fiscal police station of the three main exits of Luanda (i.e. Barra do Kuanza, Cacuaco and Viana), and at the entrance of the main parking station of Santa Clara in Cunene. <br />Secure an adequate house or office in a discrete area of the center of the survey sites.<br />Informed consent is required of all participants.<br />Participants must be sober, not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, when interviewed.<br />Consent for syphilis and HIV testing are not required for inclusion. <br />Use Time Location Sampling (TLS) methodology.<br />Conduct face to face interviews in Portuguese only.<br />Interviewers will enter the data in handheld computers.<br />Protocol must be reviewed by the appropriate IRB (s) before initiating data collection.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Survey Implementation (180 days) <br />Survey Procedures <br />Recruit 700 participants in Luanda and 250 participants in Cunene according to the inclusion criteria and methods described in Phase 1. <br />Obtain informed consent and conduct in-depth for interviews using hand-held devices. <br />Offer and conduct counseling and testing for HIV and STDs according to established local guidelines; collect specimen for testing when accepted.</p>
<p>Conduct rapid tests for HIV and syphilis (treponemic) using rapid testing technology according to local policy; provide results during post-test counseling on the initial visit. Refer participants with positive test results to a predetermined site for care and treatment; this includes participants with complaints of other STDs. <br />Follow participants to assist with care and treatment referrals.</p>
<p>Record recruitment cards, conduct recruitment interviews, and pay allowances.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Data Analysis (150 days) <br />Data Management and Analysis</p>

The solicitation number is VA-249-10-RQ-0316CSS and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
This procurement is a Total Small business Set-Aside per FAR 52.219-6, and NAICS Code is 561621. Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30. Closing date for this notice is 4:00 PM CST 07/09/2010. RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED to the CONTRACTING OFFICER via the e-CMS vendor portal see below instructions.

VAMC Memphis Security Camera System Upgrade
Statement of Work

DVRs:
DVR shall be Pelco DX8132 or equivalent 32 channel with looping expansion module and 2 terra byte video storage, must be compatible with existing cameras both PTZ and fixed which are remaining in service. They will be located on the west wall per drawing. When installed the DVRs will be the first set of devices to receive the signals from the cameras in the field. From there the signal will be routed downstream and terminated at the switch. The DVRs will also be networked so that remote users will be able to access the units as needed via their work stations:	_
Coaxitron Translator:
One additional Pelco CXTA or equivalent translator added to the existing remaining translators allowing an additional 16 PTZ cameras as needed, must be compatible with existing Pelco Spectra 2, 3 and 4 PTZ cameras. Existing coaxitrons will be relocated to the west wall.

Matrix Switch:
Given that the current configuration of the existing switch is no longer capable of expansion and is near its maximum of 128 cameras, a new switch matrix is required. The new switch, located on the west wall per the drawing, will include a new CPU, cage and all the video cards necessary to produce a switch that will provide a total of 160 camera inputs with 16 monitor outputs. New switch must be compatible with existing coaxitron translators, cameras and new DVR's. Along with the new switch, 2 new keyboard controllers will be provided to replace the existing worn-out controllers.

Re-Cabling of CCTV Head End:
The primary goal of re-cabling the head end is to provide "strain relief" or relieve the pressure and strain the cables are currently placing on the system components. Over time this has had a dramatic effect on the performance of the system by directly creating termination issues in the form of shorts and disconnects, or poor connections. In addressing the goal it will give an opportunity to deploy cable management trays and recable the entire system at the head end. This will include organizing and re-routing of the cable in a manner which will allow for easier service of the system in the future.
The camera viewing monitors are currently a mix of 9" crts and other sizes of CRT and flat panel LCD's and are scattered across south and west walls along with a mix of various computer monitors. All camera monitors will be relocated to the west wall in accordance with the included configuration drawing. The existing KVM/Voice logger monitor and keyboard and the Notifier NRT monitor and keyboard and two phones will be relocated from the west wall to the south wall per the drawing. If the monitor output card from the existing switch is still serviceable and compatible with the new 160 input
switch matrix it will be reused in the system allowing expansion to 32 call monitors. In this configuration the operators will have the ability to display 28 cameras on 7 monitors, displayed as 4 pictures per screen with the addition of 5 new DMV94Q or equivalent multiplexers to the existing multiplexers. They will also be able to use the 8th monitor as their primary call monitor to view any camera as a larger single view directly in front of them.
The monitors displaying the DVR's will remain the same with the exception of being relocated to the west wall and existing CRT monitors changed to flat panel. Five new AGN-EP-19AV-LT or equivalent flat panel monitors with mounting kits will be provided to bring the total number of existing plus new monitors to thirteen.

Included in this portion of the scope is the re-cabling of the existing KVM to maintain the administration of the DVRs, switch, and other systems currently being administrated from this work station. Also included is the cabling required to relocate Access 1 CPU display, Access 2 CPU display, telephones, KVM / Logger CPU display, and the Fire CPU display to the south wall per the drawing.

Included with any new equipment is all required software and programming necessary to properly identify, display and record all existing cameras to the Police Chief's specifications. Two copies of all submittal documents and technical manuals will be provided.

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

<DESC>Please submit your quotes to the secondary contact listed in the synopsis.&nbsp; Under the contemplated contract action, ViaSat, Inc. will provide RIMS spares equipment (items shown in the table below) needed to allow quick turn-around when outages occur . The RIMS is a principal part of the RSTN which consists of four solar radio observatory systems geographically positioned such that solar radio frequencies can be observed on a 24 hour-per-day basis. It automatically monitors, collects, quantifies and reports solar radio events on eight discrete frequencies using three parabolic dish antennas. Both standard reports and alerts are produced when appropriate. Data is processed on-site at each network location and summaries and alerts are forwarded to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). Processed data is transmitted continuously, within one minute of observation. The data is applied to meet Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and national program stated requirements for alerts and warnings when solar flares occur. This data is also applied to forecasts of near-earth space environmental conditions that adversely impact military satellite and surveillance systems, as well as High Frequency (HF) and satellite communications and power grids.
<p>This is a first time buy of these items.The quantity of these items is sufficient since they will only be used to replace failed items while those items are repaired.</p>

<SUBJECT>Distribution Labor for Temporary, Intermittent Support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Defense Distribution Center (DDC) Mission 
<SOLNBR>SP3300-10-R-0009
<CONTACT>BRIAN R ROSE, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-4673, Email brian.rose@dla.mil - THOMAS F MARTINO, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 717 770-6169, Fax 717 770-5689, Email thomas.martino@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects.  The Contractor may be required to provide a distribution capability that includes furnishing facilities, equipment, and materials and supplies to perform the requirements. Work could be performed anywhere in the DLA/DDC locations across Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC released a DRAFT solicitation on 14 January 2010.  DDC anticipates the release of the final solicitation on or around 16 July 2010.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government intends to issue a single award from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website concurrently with release of the final solicitation. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) ACTION.

DESCRIPTION: RECOVERY  This is a PRESOLICITATION SYNOPSIS. The USDA Forest Service,  (hereafter "the Government," "the Forest Service," or "the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit"), announces a requirement to construct a timber glue-laminated trail bridge with concrete abutments. The work includes the furnishing of all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, lodging, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work required under the terms and conditions of the resulting contract. Funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) will be utilized for this project. This acquisition is being advertised on an unrestricted basis and any resultant contract award will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 19, Subpart 19.10, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. In accordance with FAR Part 36.204(c), the estimated magnitude of construction is between $100,000 and $250,000. Contract period of performance time is 135 calendar days after issuance of the notice to proceed. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310. The Small Business Administration size standard is $33.5 million. Contractors are required to be actively registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis, the pending solicitation or any follow up information requests. The solicitation with supporting documents (if any) will be posted to the FedBizOpps website on or before March 20, 2010. No hard copies of the solicitation, supporting documents and applicable amendments, if any will be provided. To receive the entire solicitation package and any applicable amendments, prospective offerors must download them from the FedBizOpps website. This project is located at 35 College Drive, South Lake Tahoe, California 96150. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract.  A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. The Forest Service will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price. Technical factors consist of past performance and technical capability. Technical factors when combined are approximately equal when compared to cost or price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

PLEASE DO NOT CALL TO ASK WHEN THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED AND WHERE ARE THE DRAWINGS. THE DRAWINGS AND STATEMENT OF WORK WILL BE WITH THE RFP***** THE RFP WILL CLOSE ON MAY 28, 2010 AT 2:00 P.M. PACIFIC TIME The solicitation is being conducted as a Small Business Administration HUBzone set-aside (FAR part 19) and offers will only be accepted from HUBzone certified businesses.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** THE SOLICITATION IS NOW POSTED. PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN SECTION L AND THE TECHNCIAL EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SECTION M. THE CLOSING DATE IS CHANGED TO 19 MAY 2010, 2:00 P.M., PACIFIC TIME. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU VISIT THE SITE LOCATED WITHIN THE SAN BERNARDINO FOREST. THE POINT OF CONTACT IS AMY TERRY, AND YOU MAY CONTACT HER EITHER BY EMAIL aterry@fs.fed.us OR BY PHONE 909-382-2617.

######################################################################################################################################################AMENDMENT 0001 IS ISSUED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRE-BID MEETING/SITE VISIT. THE PRE-BID MEETING IS SCHEDULED FOR MAY 10, 2010 @ 10:00AM PACIFIC TIME. ADDRESSES OF THE BUILDINGS WILL BE PROVIDED SO YOU CAN VISIT THE SITE AT YOUR OWN PACE. PLEASE HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SPECIFICATION READY. YOU MAY EMAIL YOUR QUESTIONS TO ablodgett@fs.fed.us. THE GROSS FOOTAGE LISTED ON THE SPREADSHEET IS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE BUILDING, YOU WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE THE AREA IF THE SPECIFICATION CALLS OUT TO DO THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR WALLS OF SAME BUILDING. THE MAPS WERE OMITTED FROM THE SOLICITATION WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED ON APRIL 30TH, HOWEVER I HAVE UPLOADED THE CORRECTED SOLICITATION WITH THIS AMENDMENT. THE CLOSING DATE IS EXTENDED TO MAY 24, 2010 @ 2:00 PM, PACIFIC TIME. ######################################################################################################################################################

Amendment 0002 dated May 5, 2010 has been issued to change the pre-bid meeting date and time to May 18, 2010 @ 9 a.m., Pacific Time due to a schedule conflict with the COR and Inspector. Therefore the solicitation is extended to May 24, 2010 @ 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The award may result in more than one award due to a contractor's limited capacity to perform the large scope of work. Please download the Amendment 0002 for more details. You must acknowledge all Amendments at time of offer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%The solicitation was issued as a commerical service request for proposals, however there were inquiries on whether a bid bond was required. After revisiting the specifications, a mistake was made. The painting is a commerical service however the siding removal/repair or replacement is construction. Therefore the original solicitation issued May 5, 2010 is deleted in its entirety as well as the amendments issued against it (Amendments 0001 and 0002). The replacement construction RFP is attached to this notice under the same solicitation number dated 17 May 2010. You must acknowledge at time of offer that you are bidding the new solicitation issued 17 May 2010. A bid bond is required. The site visit is scheduled for May 18, 2010 at 9 am, Pacific Time at San Bernardino National Forest, Supervisors Building, 602 S. Tippecanoe Ave., San Bernardino. The Point of Contact is Amy Terry and this notice is posted in Section L of the solcitation. Please folllow the proposal submittal instructions in section L. Section M has the technical evaluation criteria. The locations of the buildings will be given at time of the pre-bid meeting and the buildings will be available for inspection on the 18th and 19th of May only. The solcitation is extended to May 28, 2010, 2:00 pm Pacific time.

The bid bond and performance bonds only apply to the siding and stucco costs of the solicitation. See amendment 0003. You are to acknowledge amendment 0003 and the new solcitation dated 17 May 2010 with your proposal. Amendments 0001 and 0002 are cancelled as well as the original solcitation.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; May 26, 2010, As a result of the pre-bid conference held last week (May 18th and 19th, 2010), numerous questions have been submitted for response/clarification. The engineering team will be answering those questions and modifying the specification accordingly. If you attended the pre-bid meeting and have additional questions, you must submit them to ablodgett@fs.fed.us no later than June 1, 2010 to allow sufficient time for response.

No arrangements will be made for those who have not attended the pre-bid meeting due to time constraints. Please monitor this website for changes/clarifications to the specification. As a result, the closing has been extended to June 11, 2010. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award any contracts now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this pre solicitation notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is contracting to renovate Building 3 at the NIST Boulder Campus in Boulder, Colorado. The Government intends to solicit this acquisition as a 100% small business set aside. All small businesses or small business concerns (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to propose on this project. The main requirements are assigned a NAICS code of 236220. with a small business size standard for such requirements of $33.5M. It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting - the prime contractor is required to perform at least 15% of the labor with their own employees for general construction and at least 25% of the labor with their own employees for special trade construction. For further information on the requirements for general construction and/or special trade construction, please visit the following web sites:
<p>http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/oes/2001/oesi2_17.htm</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NDEF235.HTM</p>
<p><br />Building 3 was constructed in the 1950s for hydrogen research and is a cast in place reinforced concrete and masonry structure with structural steel roof trusses. A major renovation effort shall be undertaken to transform the majority of the building space to accommodate the Fabrication Shop. The total renovated space is approximately 12000 SF [square feet]. All but 1300 SF are located at grade level.</p>
<p>As such, the project to renovate Building 3 shall include all of the following items. New electrical service and distribution, and a new building HVAC system will be installed (chilled water, steam and condensate return provided by the Central Utility Plant). Demolition of the residual equipment left from the hydrogen research as well as demolition of existing electrical service and old HVAC equipment is required. Also, some scientific research was conducted and it will be necessary to perform laboratory decommissioning on those spaces before renovation. The project will also address remediation of asbestos containing material as well as lead paint issues that are present in an aged building undergoing renovation. NIST will identify the presence of all hazardous materials in the project documentation. Architectural renovation will include floor upgrades, window replacement, painting, new suspended ceiling, restroom, office and break room remodeling, and ADA upgrades. Structural upgrades will include refurbishment of existing monorail system, enlargement of openings in structural walls, trench covers, and filling of pits and trenches. A precision measurement laboratory exists in Building 1 Wing 3 and it will be dismantled and moved to its new location in the Building 3 Instrument Fabrication Shop. Other ancillary functions such as the metal cleaning, forklift charging area, and parts washing room will accompany the move to Building 3. The Fabrication shop equipment will be prepared for movement, relocated, and set up to be functional in the renovated spaces in Building 3. One space in Building 3 occupied by the Flow Loop equipment shall remain functional during renovation and will require temporary lighting, heating, and power.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released on or about July 7, 2010, with a proposal due date approximately thirty (30) days thereafter, and an award anticipated for September, 2010. The estimated price range of this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, July 21, 2010 from 10:00am - 12:00pm at the Auditorium of the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is currently projected to be two hundred and ten (210) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Source selection will be made using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (FAR 15.101-2). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the requirements technically or price reasonableness will not be considered. All offerors who do not meet the minimum requirements will be notified as soon as they have been determined not to be in consideration any longer. Any late proposal received is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999).</p>
<p>IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT TIFFANY ATCHISON AT (303) 497-5534 OR JASON GERLOFF AT (303) 497-6320.</p>
<p>As a reminder, all contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>
<p>This procurement is set aside for small business concerns.

<DESC><p>The Government intends to solicit this acquisition for unrestricted (full and open) competition. The requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 236220 with a small business size standard of $33.5M. Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate in the performance of this contract. Each large business will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder) business concern participation. Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor, the prime contractor is required to perform at least 50% of the labor with their own employees for general construction. For further information on the requirements for general construction and/or special trade construction, please visit the following web sites:</p>
<p>http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/oes/2001/oesi2_17.htm</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NDEF235.HTM</p>
<p><br />The objective of this acquisition is to remove the existing main elevator and lobby elevators located in Building #1 and replace the elevators with new elevators, control panels, and machine equipment. The primary reason in replacing the main elevator is to provide a modernized elevator that will serve as a passenger/freight elevator as well as floor to floor transportation for scientific equipment and materials. The elevator will showcase state-of-the-art VIP control technology to transport scientific equipment "unmanned" floor to floor which will provide immediate safety to the building's community and visitors as critically sensitive equipment will not need to be accompanied by personnel.</p>
<p>The lobby elevator will also provide an essential need for citizens requiring ADA access from the main lobby level to the main elevator level which allows access to the remaining floors. The lobby elevator will be code compliant in dimension and requirement to house wheelchairs, walkers, and strollers.</p>
<p>The replacement elevators will be "Green" sensitive as the side wall support shaft piers will not penetrate the earth's surface, instead supports will rest on concrete plates above ground which eliminate contact with the surface of the environment.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released on or about July 9, 2010, with a proposal due date approximately thirty (30) days thereafter, and an award anticipated for September, 2010. The estimated price range of this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for TUESDAY, July 20, 2010 from 10:00am - 12:00pm at the Auditorium of the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is approximately 90 calendars days (the final duration will be detailed in the solicitation) after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Source selection will be made using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (FAR 15.101-2). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the technical requirements or price reasonableness will not be considered. All offerors who do not meet the minimum requirements will be notified as soon as they have been determined not to be in consideration any longer. Any late proposal received is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999).</p>
<p>THE TECHNICAL DATA, SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS, WILL BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST ONCE THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN ISSUED ON OR ABOUT JULY 9, 2010. EMAIL A REQUEST TO TIFFANY.ATCHISON@NIST.GOV REFERENCING THE SOLICITATION NUMBER (SB1341-10-RP-0084) AFTER THE SOLICITATION IS RELEASED IN FEDBIZOPPS. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT JULY 9, 2010. <br /><br />IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE PLEASE CONTACT TIFFANY ATCHISON AT TIFFANY.ATCHISON@NIST.GOV OR JASON GERLOFF AT JGERLOFF@NIST.GOV .</p>
<p>As a reminder, all contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for advancing the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) specifically focuses on supporting the development of promising biodefense therapeutic candidates/products or lead series with broad spectrum activity. The research and development activities supported through this BAA will allow candidate therapeutic countermeasures to progress through the product development pipeline toward licensure. The eventual goal is to enable the U.S. Government to stockpile these medical countermeasures to protect the American public.</p>
<p>Broad spectrum activity is a characteristic that enables a particular product to mitigate biological threats across a wide range or class of agents. There are a number of traditional threats for which effective treatments are either non-existent, of limited usefulness, or vulnerable to both naturally emerging and intentionally engineered antibacterial and antiviral resistance. A limited number of anti-infectives with broad spectrum activity directed at common, invariable, and essential components of different classes of microbes could potentially be effective against both traditional and non-traditional threats. This approach would allow a small number of drugs to replace dozens of pathogen-specific drugs for emergency use. Additionally, strategies to overcome bacterial and viral drug resistance could extend the clinical utility of existing broad spectrum anti-infectives and have immediate benefits. Moreover, broad spectrum treatments directed towards host targets or human immunological responses to infection have the potential to be effective against one or more diseases. For instance, targeting host receptors and cellular processes to treat infections and/or cellular intoxication can directly prevent or treat diseases. As well, targeting immune response mechanisms may be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality by controlling the host responses that contribute to disease or by non-specifically activating the host's natural immune defenses to induce a faster, more potent protective response. These approaches could provide clinical utility when used alone or in combination with conventional anti-infectives.</p>
<p>Broad spectrum therapeutics supported under this BAA are specified as the following classes: <br />&bull; Broad spectrum anti-bacterial: Therapeutic with activity against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C bacterial threat agent AND including at least one of the following bacterial pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, and Rickettsia prowazeki. <br /><br />&bull; Broad spectrum anti-viral: Therapeutic with activity against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C viral threat agent AND including at least one of the following viral pathogens: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Junin virus, Variola major, Dengue virus, Venezuelan encephalitis virus, Western Equine encephalitis virus, Eastern Equine encephalitis virus and human influenza virus.</p>
<p>&bull; Host-directed broad spectrum therapeutic: Therapeutic directed at a host response thereby reduces morbidity and mortality from exposure/infection and is effective against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C bacterial or viral threat AND including at least one of the following bacterial and viral pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, Rickettsia prowazeki, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Junin virus, Variola major, Dengue virus, Venezuelan Encephalitis virus, Western Equine Encephalitis virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus and human influenza virus.</p>
<p>&bull; Broad spectrum anti-toxins: Therapeutics with activity against more than one of the following toxins or activity against multiple serotypes of one of these toxins: Botulinum neurotoxin, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens, and ricin toxin.</p>
<p>Offerors shall propose a well-defined product development path that must enable and include the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial prior to or within a 5-year contract period of performance. The performance of studies in vertebrate animals and clinical studies must be consistent with all applicable Federal regulations and the DMID, NIAID, and NIH policies and guidelines for the conduct and oversight of research in vertebrate animals and human subjects. This solicitation will also support post-Phase 1 product development activities which are enabling for a biologic license application (BLA) or a new drug application (NDA), including: <br />&bull; Manufacturing scale-up leading to consistency lot manufacturing. <br />&bull; Phase 2 clinical trials. <br />&bull; Animal studies leading to pivotal animal efficacy studies required to support licensure under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "Animal Rule" (New Drug and Biological Drug Products; Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible: http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/humeffic.htm).</p>
<p>Plans for advancing therapeutic candidates/products or lead series through the product development path shall be proposed, implemented and funded in stages with specific decision gates and well-defined criteria for determining the merit and feasibility of advancing to the next stage. Offerors may submit proposals for more than one therapeutic candidate/product or lead series; however, a separate Technical and Business Proposal is required for each therapeutic candidate/product or lead series. If a single therapeutic candidate/product or lead series is being proposed for activity against more than one of the selected pathogens within the scope of this BAA, only a single Technical and Business Proposal is required.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to apply state-of-art and innovative technological approaches and platforms in the development of the proposed broad spectrum therapeutics. State-of-art and innovative technological approaches refer to capabilities, such as temperature stabilization or delivery method, that can be engineered into a wide array of existing and candidate products to enhance the product performance. Technological platforms, on the other hand, are standardized methods that can be used to significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring medical countermeasures to market.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded on or about July 29, 2011. The length of the project proposed by the offeror, should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research, but should not exceed 5 years.<br />The NIAID estimates that one to three contracts may be issued for a total cost of up to $17 million per year. However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about June 25, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a follow up synopsis to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00421-10-NR-55021. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-273 NAVAL UNDERGRADUATE FLIGHT TRAINING SYSTEMS, Patuxent River, MD has a requirement for tasking and equipment required for Organization, Intermediate, and possibly Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support for the USN T-34, T-44 and T-6 trainer aircraft programs. This support is currently being performed under Contract N00019-06-D-0017 awarded to Sikorsky Support Services, Inc (SSSI). In addition, Contract N00019-10-C-0051 was awarded to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC to primarily assist SSSI with on-site scheduled maintenance for both T-34 and T-44 to recover Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) FY10 Pilot Throughput Rate (PTR). The NAVAIR Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) website is available at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to assorted satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms at the following satellite sights: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC).</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC). The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.</p>
<p>THE USN NO LONGER INTENDS TO USE SEAPORT-E TO SOLICIT OFFERS FOR THIS EFFORT AND NOW INTENDS TO USE FULL &amp; OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES VIA FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES USING SOLICITATION NUMBER N00019-10-R-0069. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATION RELEASE IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN SEPTEMBER WITH INDUSTRY SITE VISITS TO VIEW THE MATERIAL CONDITION OF AIRCRAFT AFTER SOLICITATION RELEASE. FULL PERFORMANCE IS ANTICIPATED TO COMMENCE BY 1 APRIL 2011. Please continue to monitor this website, as well as the NAVAIR open solicitation website at the following URL http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm for updated information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Attached hereto is a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and DRAFT associated documents for industry's review and feedback. The Government has incorporated comments provided during previous PMA 273 industry days and one-on-one sessions, and is receptive to additional ideas to further reduce or limit constraining requirements, approaches to reduce risks, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award, and the Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) reflects areas of interest and concern to the Government. The PMF represents a more focused means of measuring Contractor performance, and measures alignment with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Sustainment, Performance and ultimately PTR. The Government is seeking input with respect to the notional incentive arrangement itself, and how best to incentivize meeting PTR, which is a critical component of CNATRA's mission.&nbsp; The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the upcoming requirement is intended to include at least a base year with one (1) or two (2) one-year options. The final selection of contract types and the scope of work within each type have not been determined at this time. Fixed price elements are likely to be associated with Total Lifecycle Product Support (TLPS), other than conditional maintenance. Cost reimbursement elements are likely to be associated with conditional maintenance and the parts and consumables. The Government expects to project expenditures for the parts and consumable cost reimbursement elements, based on past experience in the procurement of parts and consumables supporting the PWS. Incentive elements are likely to be associated with attainment of performance measured by the PMF. The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions regarding contract type, incentive arrangements, and contract line item structure.</p>
<p><strong>The Government invites industry feedback via written comments, recommendations, and questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 24 June 2010; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals.&nbsp; Please submit to Jessica McGee at <a href="mailto:jessica.mcgee@navy.mil">jessica.mcgee@navy.mil</a>.</strong></p>

Prime contractor should have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm, or team, with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects. The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Civil Engineer, Natural Resources Specialist, Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator and Architect.
Probable Scope:
The project will develop approximately 10,000 columbarium niches in two separate areas, one on the western side of Outer Drive and a second in the southeastern section of the cemetery where the existing administration building and public restroom is currently located. In addition to the columbarium development, the project will provide a new administration building with public information center (PIC), including public restrooms, and electronic gravesite locator; demolition of the existing administration building; replacement of the existing signage and site furnishings throughout the cemetery; utilities, irrigation, and supporting infrastructure; access roads; energy (LEED) improvements; global positioning system site integration; and road improvements and repairs, as well as infrastructure repairs and upgrades as identified in the Study on Improvements to Veterans Cemeteries. The new building complex (comprising the administrative offices, PIC and public restrooms) will incorporate enhanced information technology and physical security requirements. Design shall include mitigation of any environmental and historic issues identified during the environmental assessment process.
Once a thorough analysis of the user and the cemetery needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.
Incorporate Green Building Principles and Renewable Energy Initiatives. The complete project shall be LEED silver certified and meet all Federal Energy and Sustainability mandates.
This project will be accomplished utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide.

The selected firm shall design to the estimated government cost for construction.
The schematics and design development will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost. The construction documents and construction period services shall be awarded at the option of the government. In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the cost and scope management capabilities of the applicants. Applicants must be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work and be licensed in the State of Hawaii. Preference will be given to firms with working offices in the State of Hawaii.
No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (00CFM3B1, Attention: DEREK UNDERWOOD, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW (00CFM3B1), Washington, D.C. 20420, one on a Compact Disc or DVD and one original hard copy on or before 2:00PM Local Time, August 2, 2010. A current SF 330 Part II, representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with current SF 330 Part IIs for each proposed consultant offices involved.
Applicants will be rated based on the relevant experience - planning and design of projects of similar scale and scope - of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicant capacity to do the work, record of past performance on VA work, geographic consideration, the participation of minority-owned and woman-owned consultants and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.
Award of contract is dependent upon the availability of funds.
This is not a request for a proposal. If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, HUB Zone Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business contracting goals will be: 17.7% (SB), 5% (SDB), 5% (WOSB), 3% (HUB Zone), 5% (VOSB) and 3% (SDVOSB).

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA) of 2009. In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder (TO) 41 was issued under contract NNJ08JB01C, the Environmental Contract, toprocure environmental services in support of the JSC Waste Disposal Support forConstruction of Facilities Projects to Repair, Clean and Caulk PEAF Panels funded by theRecovery Act. The environmental services include project and field activity oversight forcompliance with JSC Policies and Procedures and applicable permits and other applicableregulatory constraints.  The contractor shall obtain and track usage of air emissions;(volatile organic compounds) for the purpose of assessing conformance with TexasCommission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) air regulations. In addition modification 84was issued for funding Task Order 41. &lt;P&gt;The Environmental Contract was awarded on a competitive basis. These Task Orders wereissued under the cost-type contract arrangement in accordance with the contract. Acost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertainties involved in contractperformance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use anytype of fixed-price contract. In addition, a cost-type contract was selected to providethe contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given thetypes of services to be performed. This Environmental Contract has experienced personneland documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet therequirements of the Recovery Act in the most prudent business manner, with the timeconstraints imposed, the existing Environmental Contract is the most appropriatecontractual vehicle for the work required.

<DESC>The proposed research program is aimed at stimulating research that will lead to the development of evidence-based strategies that encourage regular heavy drinkers to initiate and sustain a change from a maladaptive to a healthier lifestyle. A key innovative concept to be applied is the modeling of the drinking behavior control system, which integrates relevant variables and processes to produce specific drinking behaviors and trajectories and the interdisciplinary approach to understanding how and why behavioral change initiation for alcohol drinking occurs. The proposed research program is interested in three levels of analyses: (1) Neurophysiologic factors, (2) Intrapersonal factors and (3) Interpersonal factors. The anticipated result of this research program is the development of new models to be used to design behavioral interventions in alcohol abuse.
