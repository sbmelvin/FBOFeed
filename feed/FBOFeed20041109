<RESPDATE>022205
<ARCHDATE>11092005
<CONTACT>Raymond Balcerak, Program Manager, MTO, Phone (xxx) xxx-xxxx, Fax (703) 696-2206, Email rbalcerak@darpa.mil
<DESC>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Visible/Short Wave Infrared-Photon Counting Arrays (PCAR).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

DARPA is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design and testing that directly supports revolutionary advances in imaging technology at extremely low levels of ambient illumination, from the visible through the short wave infrared.  The goal is to develop large format, high resolution imaging sensors compatible with on-focal plane image enhancement and image transmission technologies.  Imaging at extremely low levels of illumination, where images are obtained with only a few photon events, allows operation in a wide variety of environments and situations, and imaging in conditions where current sensors are inadequate.  The overall program goal is development of imaging technology with performance and image quality exceeding current low light level imagers and image intensifiers and extension of the response into the short wave infrared. 

Operating near background photon fluctuation limits is the ultimate technology goal, with high quantum efficiency sensors that have photon counting capability from the visible to the short-wave infrared.  Innovative techniques must be developed for achieving a high gain with near-zero excess noise in a high-density array format.  High dynamic range is also important since the sensor must operate over a wide range of light levels.  A large format array, with small pixels for imaging at high light level, and novel approaches for amplification with near-zero noise for conditions of extremely low ambient illumination, addresses the need for high resolution and imaging at low photon flux.  

The sensitivity and resolution must be accompanied by high dynamic range and the ability to image in the presence of high intensity sources without image artifacts.  The high-resolution sensor technology must include controls to limit cross talk between pixels, especially with high illumination.         

Intended applications include unattended sensors, surveillance sights, and micro-vehicles both air and ground.  Missions are envisioned from both stationary and mobile platforms.  The mobile platforms require sensors imaging at sufficiently high frame rate to reduce or eliminate smear in the image.  Applications also include communication among sensors in an unattended sensor network or between sensors in different platforms.  The sensor output must be compatible with high-speed image transmission technology at the data rates required for imaging large format arrays.

In all applications the power requirement is an important system consideration.  Innovative low power device technology and power management strategies must be incorporated into the sensor array to reduce power requirements. 

Operating at room temperature considerably reduces power, sensor size and weight, and facilitates the development of micro-sensor system concepts.  The micro-sensor concept opens new system applications, not previously possible with sensors that require cooling to maintain acceptable levels of dark current.  Strategies for reduction of material defects and minimization of dark current at the device level must be developed to keep power at absolute minimum.      

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Visible/Short Wave Infrared-Photon Counting Arrays program will consist of a Phase I (approximately 12 months) followed by a Phase II (approximately 12 months) and Phase III (approximately 12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards are expected to be made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase) Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-05-06/ - has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.

<CONTACT>Raymond Balcerak, Program Manager, MTO, Phone (xxx) xxx-xxxx, Fax (703) 696-2206, Email rbalcerak@darpa.mil
<DESC>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of High Operating Temperature Mid-Wave Infrared Focal Plane Arrays (HOT MWIR), addressing infrared detectors and focal plane arrays with spectral response beyond 3 microns, operating at or near room temperature.  The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors and focal plane arrays leading to high operating temperature mid-wave infrared arrays.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.      

The primary goal of this program is to establish the technology for high-speed sampling and high spatial resolution infrared focal plane arrays that operate without cryogenic cooling. Designs should have broadband response over the three-to-five micron spectral band and narrow-band response suited to the application.  

Applications include affordable sensor arrays for threat detection and imaging. For imaging, long wave response may be desired in some applications.  The threat detection and imaging functions may be designed into separate arrays or combined into a single array.  The program focuses on innovative concepts and approaches to realize detector technology, which may be either thermally or photon sensitive and will include large area, low defect density material, unique thermally sensitive microstructures, and detector concepts and focal plane read-outs required for wide field-of-regard integrated imaging micro-systems. 

For threat warning, the design of the focal plane array must be consistent with processing to distinguish threats from false alarms and to identify the various types of threats.  The characteristics of the detector technology must also be compatible with this goal.  Various types of target discrimination techniques may be considered, for example time sampling, spectral band discrimination, spatial content and target characteristics with time.  The time and spectral response of the detector and focal plane array components must be compatible with these goals.

In addition, applications of room temperature mid-wave focal planes cover a wide range of platforms, both high and medium performance systems.  In the high performance systems, an increase in operating temperature serves to reduce cost, increase reliability, and provide the enabling technology to produce an increased number of sensors for particular application.  In medium performance systems, the operating temperature may be increased to room temperature, while meeting performance goals.  The room temperature mid wave infrared has the capability to be the enabling technology, creating new classes of systems, significantly enhancing military capability and leading the way to new applications.

<CONTACT>Charlotte Rupprecht, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5856, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Charlotte.Rupprecht@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in projects offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and development of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperatives agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

The emergency responder community has a need to acquire, synthesize, communicate and share critical information. These abilities are key elements in an effective response to
any emergency situation. This need has become more critical as the emergency responder community prepares to employ more coordinated responses to emergency situations and
new terrorist threats facing our nation. It is crucial to ensure that all information flowing into and out of the focal point of incident command is managed properly to ensure optimal use in supporting command and control and decision support.
This BAA seeks proposals to develop an innovative new architecture to support the information management and sharing requirements of the emergency responder community. After the completion of these studies, HSARPA anticipates competing and
funding a follow-on program to develop and field test technologies and systems which are found to be most advantageous during the architecture study phase.

The ability to manage personnel, direct equipment, and seamlessly communicate, gather, store, redistribute, and secure any mission critical information needed by incident
commanders and emergency responders during an emergency situation defines Unified Incident Command & Decision Support (UICDS). At present, the emergency responder community, composed of law enforcement, fire departments, emergency medical teams,
chemical weapons response teams, radiation and nuclear specialist, etc. have had limited success in the area of coordinated response due to inadequate, insecure, and incompatible training tools and information technologies. The full capabilities of information management technologies should be brought to bear on behalf of the emergency responder community in the form of a system that allows incident commanders and emergency responders to manage the flow of data, voice, and video information in addition to other forms of information. The very nature of emergency situations and the
complexity and volume of information flowing into and out of incident command positions demand a more integrated information management architecture. UICDS systems based on this highly interconnected and integrated architecture should meet the
needs of the entire emergency responder community and its design should allow for integration, when needed, between local, state, and federal information management,situation awareness and C4ISR systems. The integration of individual local, state, and/or
federal information management systems should create an interconnected, information sharing ‘network of networks’ whose overall capabilities are greater than the sum of its
individual parts.

The research, development, and launch of a UICDS information management system is crucial to the future operations of incident commanders and emergency responders. The goal of this BAA is to harness innovative ideas in an effort to create an information management and sharing architecture specifically designed to meet the needs of incident commanders and emergency responders throughout the nation and realize a robust, fully
functional UICDS information management system to enhance the safety and effectiveness of this nation’s emergency responder community.

<DESC>This requirement in support of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this requirement issued as a request for quotation is N00253-05-Q-0031. The solicitation document incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-25.  NUWC Keyport has a requirement for the following:  CLIN 0001: Quantity, 2 each, E-Tester, Floating Network License, Part Number: ETR-XXXXX-FN-P or equal per list of critical requirements.  CLIN 0002:  Quantity 1 each, E-Manager Enterprise Single Floating User License Part Number: EGE-XXXXX-FN-P or equal per list of critical requirements.  CLIN 0003:  Quantity 1 each ! E-Load Controller, Node Locked License, Part Number: ELD-CRTRLR-NL-P or equal per list of critical requirements.  CLIN 0004:  Quantity 1 Group, 50 Web Virtual Users for E-Load–Node Locked License, Part Number ELV-00050-NL-P or equal per list of critical requirements.  CLIN 0005:  Quantity 1 Group, E-Test Suite On-Site Training Class Part Number: TRA-00003-OS-X or equal.  Class anticipated to be two to three days.  CLIN 0006:  Quantity 1 Group, Software Subscription E-Test Annual Support, Part Number: MTI-XXXXX-ST-X or equal.  Background:  Currently there is no efficient method of testing ASM.  Testing such an enormous application with current resources would require a vast amount of time and manpower as each and every section would have to be laboriously checked and rechecked.  In addition to checking the forms for validity, one must take into consideration the way in which ASM is used.  Meaning that it is a multi-user application that resides on a server and must be tested ! in a way that confirms its ability to perform adequately under heave user loads.  We require a software suite that not only allows the tester to create macros that confirm validity but also create a large number of simulated users that can load test ASM and provide statistical information as to how well it performed.  Without this ability the team cannot be certain of ASMs performance issues until after a server loaded with it has been fielded and goes online.  This is not an acceptable method of determining if there are software problems that need to be resolved.  The automated software testing suite and user should be able to effectively do the work of a whole team of testers at a fraction of the cost and provide more detailed and accurate results.  Following is a list of critical requirements that must be met:  1. Must be able to interact with personal key infrastructure (PKI) certificates.  2. Must be able to use software to create test scripts for a web-based applicatio! ns as well as have support for .NET and J2EE environments.  3. Test scripts must be able to test application for functionality and survivability.  4. Must be able to create variable data scripts that accept information from file input.  5. Must be able to load test the application and have reporting tools to convey test information that is easy to understand.  6. Single point control for distributed load testing agents.  7. Functionality tests must be able to be reused for load testing as well.  8. Must have customized programmability using VBA.  9. Software suite must have a centralized management system for scripts, results, requirements, etc. 10. Centralized management system must be able to utilize a local web server in order to allow users to access it from any location.  11.  Centralized management system must have support for both manual and automated tests.  12. Integration between testing products (ie. load tester will work with functionality tester which will commu! nicate to the management system, and so on). 13. Easy to use script creation system including the ability to record user actions (low learning curve). 14. Ability to perform data validation (i.e. when A and B are selected, program insures that the expected value C is returned). 15. Vendor must provide training and support services. 16. Vendor must also have a yearly product maintenance service.  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 541511 and has a size standard of $21M.  This requirement is to be FOB Destination, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport, Keyport, WA 98345-7610 with Inspection and Acceptance at Destination with a required delivery date no later than 7 days after date of award.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for purchasing a 15,000 gallon capacity, stainless steel liquid nitrogen tank to protect and preserve NASA’s astromaterial collection. The nitrogen delivered to the Astromaterial sample collection cabinets must meet high cleanliness and purity standards; therefore, the liquid nitrogen storage tank must be composed of an oxygen-cleaned inner stainless steel vessel. All associated tubing and fittings must be oxygen-cleaned stainless steel as well. The requirements for the Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) Tank are as follows: 1) 15,000 gallon capacity, standard valve and control systems 2) Stainless steel inner vessel, oxygen cleaned 3) Super-Insulation (SI) system 4) Stainless steel fittings/tubing associated with vessel, oxygen cleaned 5) Vessel maximum working pressure 100 psi 6) Telemetry package for remote display of controls 7) Dual relief valves 8) Liquid nitrogen pull-off station NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Firestone Diversified, Inc. in Houston, Texas, a distributor of Chart Industries products. Chart Industries manufactures liquid nitrogen storage tanks with the capacity necessary to meet NASA requirements. Chart Industries’ tank design has a unique insulation system.  Their standard tank comes with an Aerogel-Based Super-Insulation (SI) material that provides excellent thermal performance, and which yields (1) a more efficient system because of its slower evaporation rate and (2) a smaller, lighter weight tank.  The Super-Insulation (SI) System is the required insulation material for the Astromaterials Curation nitrogen tank and it is only available through Chart Industries. Furthermore, the Astromaterials Curation nitrogen tank is classified as a JSC Critical Facility, which is protected under the Mission Essential Infrastructure Protection Program.  The Astromaterials Curation Office requires that this item be provided through a Chart distributor in close proximity to JSC for start-up assistance and future service needs.	Firestone Diversified, Inc. is the only Chart distributor in Houston, Texas and near the Johnson Space Center. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on November 15, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.301, with Process Applications, Inc.  This requirement is to complete efforts to expand the technical scope of the Area-wide Optimization Program (AWOP) to include the control of disinfection byproducts (DBP) formation and the development of an improved jar test calibration procedure to provide treatment plant operations staff with a valuable process control tool.  This work directly supports the optimization program done by the Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water's Technical  Support Center (TSC), who has worked with Process Applications, Inc. to create a model for developing and implementing AWOPs.  Process Applications, Inc. has completed 90% of this effort. An AWOP utilizes targeted performance improvement procedures such as Composite Correction Program (CCP).  The  CCP consists of an evaluation phase, or a Comprehensive Performance Evaluation (CPE) and a follow-up component, called Comprehensive Technical Assistance (CTA).  Under the AWOP model, four Regional AWOPs have been established in EPA Regions 3, 4, 6 and 10.  However, additional work needs to be done  to "fine-tune" several DBP and microbial optimization approaches and verify that the AWOP model is appropriate. This work is critical since commitments have been made to the Regional AWOP programs related to these deliverables being completed in 2005.  Under this requirement, the following tasks  shall be achieved: 1) DBP CTA materials development and pilot testing, 2) DBP Targeted Technical Assistance Tools development and demonstration, 3) strategic implementation of Jar Test Calibration procedures and 4) Assessment of existing State and Regional AWOPs.  This is not a request for  proposal.  Sources that would like to be considered must submit documentation within 15 days of the date of this posting.  Submit your request for consideration in writing to Renita Tyus via email: tyus.renita@epa.gov or fax at (513) 487-2115.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps has a requirement for procurement and delivery of Mobile Electric Power Distribution - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) sets to include Technical Manuals and initial training as follows: 5 kilowatt Power Panel for Indoor use (maximum quantity of 400); 5 kilowatt Power Panel for Outdoor use (maximum quantity of 400); 15 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 300); 30 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 250); 100 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 100); 300 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 50); 10 different cable assembly/set types (maximum quantity of 1750); CAM Lock Connectors Set (maximum quantity of 250); and 2 sizes of Cable Reels (maximum quantity of 1200).

This effort will be 100% Set Aside for Small Business and pursued as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 12. The MEPDIS-R program has been initiated to produce and deploy a commercial-based MEPDIS that will fulfill the performance objectives set forth in the specification. The MEPDIS is a replacement for the existing Mil-Standard MEPDIS, with a commercial based, tailorable system of power distribution panels and cables that can be rapidly procured in support of military operations.  Current systems, although meeting the need, are heavy, expensive and have a long lead-time procurement cycle. The USMC also intends to adopt commercial connectors for power lead interface, vice traditional military-style connectors.

The MEPDIS-R shall be capable of supplying 60Hz electrical power for varied power requirements when used with 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 100 kW standard military generator sets. Additionally, the system must be capable of distributing 120/208V power, Y-connected power. The future MEPDIS is envisioned to consist of lightweight, modular, distribution panels NEMA 3R (minimum), NEMA 4X (desired). The panels shall be in size configurations to handle 5, 15, 30 and 100 kW of electrical through-put, with the ability to be interconnected with lightweight, multi-conductor cables, with connectors sized by amperage, keyed for voltage, and capable of rapid connect/disconnect. Through adaptor cables, the system shall be capable of interconnecting with other Services' electrical power distribution systems, utilizing Military Standard Class-L electrical connectors, with a 3-phase, 5-wire (4-wire with equipment ground) capability.

All information relative to this procurement, to include the release of the Formal RFP document will be available to industry via FedBizOpps on or about November 26, 2004. Questions regarding this effort should be addressed to Gabrielle Trickett.

<SUBJECT>15 -- CH-46E LIGHTWEIGHT REPLACEMENT ARMORED SEAT PROGRAM (LRASP)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N00019-05-P7-ZD035

<DESC>The U. S. Marine Corps has identified a requirement to replace the existing Armored Pilot and Co-Pilot Crashworthy Seat System on the CH-46E helicopter with a lightweight substitute to reduce aircraft weight thus enhancing safety and enabling the aircraft to carry additional combat-loaded troops without degrading the aircraft’s defensive capabilities.  This new seat system will provide, at a minimum, a 200 lb weight reduction over the existing seat system and display the same fit parameters of the existing pair of seats.  The total weight of the existing metallic armor system is 462 pounds (231 pounds each for the Pilot and Co-Pilot seats).  With the exception of mounting rails/tracks, the new seat system shall mate with existing airframe structure without benefit of modification. The new seat system will provide the following ballistic and crash protection characteristics:
Ballistics Protection
Seat back and bottom will be capable of withstanding V50 specification ballistic requirements, 7.62x51 ball M80, 0 degrees obliquity at a minimum of 2500 feet per second (fps) and have a side protection panel that meets V50 specification ballistic requirements to withstand .30 cal APM2 round at 2800 fps with 30 deg angle of obliquity.  The side protection panel must be easily stowed to allow unencumbered aircraft egress during emergency.
Crash Capability/Survivability Protection
(a)Static crash protection thresholds:
1.  Minimum static load factors of 20g forward, 15g aft, 20g down, 10g up and 10g laterally in the aircraft axis each acting separately. 
2. Occupant weight of 265 lbs. 95th percentile occupant required for analysis, qualification and test purposes. 
(b)Dynamic crash protection objectives:  
1. Combined Vertical:  With the seat pitched forward 30 degrees and rolled 10 degrees, the seat will protect occupants in a crash pulse of 48G with a velocity change of 50 fps.  In this combined vertical impact condition the seat will attenuate vertical accelerations transmitted to occupants through downward stroking so that human tolerance limits are not exceeded for 3rd through 98th percentile male occupants.   
2. Vertical:   In the pure vertical direction the seat will protect occupants in a crash pulse 
of 48G with a velocity change of 42 fps.  In this vertical impact condition the seat will attenuate vertical accelerations transmitted to occupants through downward stroking so that human tolerance limits are not exceeded for 3rd through 98th percentile male occupants.   

3. Combined Forward:  With the seat yawed 30 degrees from longitudinal, the seat will 
protect 3rd through 98th percentile male occupants in a crash pulse of 30G with a velocity change of 50 fps.   Longitudinal load attenuation can be included to reduce loads transmitted to the floor interface so that the static load values of Paragraph (a) are not exceeded. 
Industry Day
An LRASP Industry Day is scheduled for Wednesday, 1 Dec 2004, from 8:00 AM EST to 1000 AM EST at the Naval Aviation Depot (NAVAIRDEPOT), Cherry Point, NC, to provide the specific details of the technical requirements and the program schedule. An aircraft will be available for familiarizing potential offerors with the location of the current seat system and to provide access for taking measurements.  The Government will accept written questions from industry following this meeting and will provide the answers as an attachment to the solicitation which is expected to be released on or around 18 January 2005.  The CH-46E program is looking to expedite the fielding of these new seats.  Therefore, only those offerors with a seat currently in production will be considered.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate ergonomic evaluation, seat fit and occupant egress in a CH-46E cockpit prior to written proposal submission.  The seat fit demonstration will be conducted at NADEP Cherry Point NC on or around 1 Feb 2005.  Submittal of test data documenting the crash qualification of the seating system will also be required at time of test fit.  Offerors must be able to deliver their proposed seat to the Government-approved baseline configuration within 5 months after contract award and, upon exercise of the options, shall deliver the production units at a minimum rate of 3 units per month.  Additional aircraft access will be available, by appointment only, for initial seat fit and measurements prior to proposal submission. The estimated quantity for this procurement is 147 kits (294 seats) or other such quantities as may be authorized and appropriated by Congress.   Seats will be procured over a period of 3 years.   All questions regarding this procurement shall be directed to Ms. Julie Matheny, (301) 757-6570, Julie.Matheny@navy.mil or Ms. Janice Woehrer, (301) 757-6551, Janice.Woehrer@ navy.mil.  The address is Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: AIR-2.4.3.3, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg 2272, Suite 353, Patuxent River, MD  20670-1547.  The POC for the LRASP Industry Day is Ms. Trish Butler, (252) 464-9382, Patricia.l.Butler1@navy.mil.  Please contact her for visit request information and to provide attendance confirmation. Visit requests are due to the NAVAIRDEPOT Cherry Point, NC, no later than 23 Nov 2004.  Visit requests received after that date may not be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This project requires the placement of sand along Miami Beach in the vicinity of 63rd Street to 83rd Street using an offshore, upland or a combination of a domestic source of sand to be provided by the contractor.  Approximately 400,000 cubic yards o f material will be required to fill the beach area between monuments DNR-38 to DNR-46.  This segment of beach is approximately 8,600 feet long.  It will have a 205-foot berm width from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) at El. 9 MLW with a foreshore slope of 1  Vertical on 15 Horizontal.  A 50-foot wide pipeline corridor, centered at 553,290 North, is provided for placement of fill from the offshore. Any plan to use a large number of trucks hauling material along the local roads of the beaches will not be accept able.  The contractor will establish the domestic sand source for this project, based upon government criteria.  The sand must be suitable for Southeast Florida beaches.  It must be free of debris, sharp rocks and pebbles, concrete rubble, and clay.  The a verage mean grain size shall be equal to or greater than 0.30 mm [(1.74 phi) for upland domestic sources and 0.27 mm (1.88 phi) for an offshore, domestic source] and less than 0.55mm (0.86 phi) for all domestic sources.  The fines must be less than 5%(pass ing the #230 sieve).  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the material must pass the 3/8-inch sieve for an upland source.  For either upland or offshore domestic sources, ninety-five percent (95%) of the material must pass the No. 4 sieve size with no particles l arger than 3/4-inch diameter.  Sand mineralogy composed predominantly of quartz or calcium carbonate is required.  Sand not hydraulically placed shall be completely saturated to achieve a density comparable to hydraulically placed sand.  The sand shall hav e a color similar to the existing beach.  Manufactured sand is not environmentally acceptable.  Protection of the environment, especially the existing offshore reef system, is very important.  The Contractors operations will have to be carried out in acco rdance with permit requirements.  It is anticipated that this project may be constructed during the turtle-nesting season and precautions will have to be taken.  The contractor will be expected to provide the necessary permit documents and certificates of compliance for use of the borrow source or sufficient data to allow the borrow source to be permitted with regulatory agencies.  The Performance Period is 185 days.  A CD will not be issued.  The solicitation is available on this web site:  https://ebs1.sa j.usace.army.mil/ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp.  THIS  ACQUISITION WILL BE AN UNRESTRICTED PROCUREMENT being issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, past performance and price; however, it will be accomplished by a two-step Reque st for Proposal (RFP) process.  In Step 1, the Technical Proposals will provide information on the sand source, technical merit evaluation factors and past performance.  The Government will evaluate the sand source portion of the proposal on a Go/No-Go bas is.  The sand source submission will be reviewed to determine that the proposed source meets all sand criteria as outlined in the solicitation requirements and, if they do, permits will be sought.  For proposals that meet the sand source criteria, the Gove rnment will then evaluate the remaining technical proposal and past performance submittals.  For proposals that DO NOT meet the sand source criteria, the Government will rate them NO GO and remove them from any further consideration.  Offerors, whose sand source receives permits, will be invited to submit a price in Step 2 of the RFP evaluation.  Offerors should anticipate up to a year delay between Steps 1 and 2 of this action.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered. There will  be a price preference for identified HUBZone small business concerns that comply with the requirements of the solicitation as stipulated in FAR 19.1307. You must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration in order to be eligible to receive an aw ard from this solicitation. Call 1-888-227-2423 for more information.  NAICS Code is 237990, size standard $28.5 million.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/23/04.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 12/23/04  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.

<CONTACT>Judy F. McMichael, 251-441-6510
<DESC>This solicitation, originally advertised and modified on 5 October 2004 and again on 2 November 2004, is again modified as follows:  CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineering (A-E) services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Contract for Surve ying & Mapping Services to support the Mobile District and the South Atlantic Division. The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to award multiple contracts for Survey and Mapping Services for support of the Military, Civil Works, and Support For Oth ers Programs within the boundaries or other locations as may be assigned to the Mobile District and South Atlantic Division as a result of this solicitation. Initially, one contract will be awarded on an unrestricted basis using a full and open competition  and one contract will be a warded as a small business set-aside. One evaluation board will be assembled to evaluate all proposals received from the solicitation announcement.  From the evaluation process no less than six (6) Most Highly Qualified firms wi ll be short listed, while insuring that at least three (3) small business firms are included.  Final rankings of all the Most Highly Qualified firms will be established.  The selection strategy is to first select the highest ranked small business firm to n egotiate a contract to fulfill the requirements of the small business set-aside.  The second contract will be negotiated with the firm that is the highest ranked firm from the remainder of the Most Highly Qualified list.  If a third contract is needed and the second contract is awarded to a firm that is not small business, then the firm selected will be the next highest ranked small business firm from the remaining firms on the Most Highly Qualified list.  If the second contract is awarded to a small busine ss firm, then the third contract will be negotiated with the highest ranked firm remaining on the Most Highly Qualified list.  If a fourth contract is needed the firm selected will be the next highest ranked firm from the remaining Most Highly Qualified li st.  If additional awards are made, firms will be selected in the same manner to insure that at least one-half of all contracts are awarded to small business. The contract term for award to a large business will be for three (3) years and five (5) years fo r a small business. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The cumulative amount of all task orders will not exceed $3,000,000 if an award is made to a large business, and will not exceed $5,000,000 for award(s) to small business(e s). The Government intends to initially award all contracts for $1,000,000, with the reserved right to modify each contract amount to the full solicited amount stated herein during the term of the contract. If a large business is selected for this co ntrac t, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 50.9% of the contractor's intended sub cont ract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), 8.8% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), 7.2% be placed with women-owned small businesses (WOSB), 2.9% be placed with HUB Zone small business, and 0.5% be placed with Service-Disabled V ete ran-Owned Small Business. A detailed subcontracting plan must be submitted during contract negotiation. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan why the above goals cannot be met. Sele ct ion of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these co ntracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4,000,000. All other requirements remain the same.

Compliance requirements include cultural resources site survey and identification, evaluation, protection, collections curation, and development of public awareness programs (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended).   The purpose of this effort is; 1) to develop a Ã¢Â€Âœhistoric contextÃ¢Â€Â for the Nez Perce members of the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho (Nez Perce) for Corps-managed lands in the Walla Walla District, 2) to define expected traditional cultural property (TCP)  types that are associated with the historic context, 3) to identify, map and record specific TCPs located on Corps lands that are associated with the Nez Perce, 4) to complete National Register of Historic Places registration forms for specific TCPs, and 5) to create a final report.

<DESC>This project requires the placement of sand along Miami Beach in the vicinity of 63rd Street to 83rd Street using an offshore, upland or a combination of both of a domestic source of sand to be provided by the contractor.  Approximately 400,000 cubic  yards of material will be required to fill the beach area between monuments DNR-38 to DNR-46.  This segment of beach is approximately 8,600 feet long.  It will have a 205-foot berm width from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) at El. 9 MLW with a foreshore sl ope of 1 Vertical on 15 Horizontal.  A 50-foot wide pipeline corridor, centered at 553,290 North, is provided for placement of fill from the offshore. Any plan to use a large number of trucks hauling material along the local roads of the beaches will not b e acceptable.  The contractor will establish the domestic sand source for this project, based upon government criteria.  The sand must be suitable for Southeast Florida beaches.  It must be free of debris, sharp rocks and pebbles, concrete rubble, and clay .  The average mean grain size shall be equal to or greater than 0.30 mm [(1.74 phi) for upland domestic sources and 0.27 mm (1.88 phi) for an offshore, domestic source] and less than 0.55mm (0.86 phi) for all domestic sources.  The fines must be less than  5%(passing the #230 sieve).  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the material must pass the 3/8-inch sieve for an upland source.  For either upland or offshore domestic sources, ninety-five percent (95%) of the material must pass the No. 4 sieve size with no par ticles larger than 3/4-inch diameter.  Sand mineralogy composed predominantly of quartz or calcium carbonate is required.  Sand not hydraulically placed shall be completely saturated to achieve a density comparable to hydraulically placed sand.  The sand s hall have a color similar to the existing beach.  Manufactured sand is not environmentally acceptable.  Protection of the environment, especially the existing offshore reef system, is very important.  The Contractors operations will have to be carried out  in accordance with permit requirements.  It is anticipated that this project may be constructed during the turtle-nesting season and precautions will have to be taken.  The contractor will be expected to provide the necessary permit documents and certific ates of compliance for use of the borrow source or sufficient data to allow the borrow source to be permitted with regulatory agencies.  The Performance Period is 185 days.  Proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, past performance and price; howeve r, it will be accomplished by a two-step Request for Proposal (RFP) process.  In Step 1, the Technical Proposals will provide information on the sand source, technical merit evaluation factors and past performance.  The Government will evaluate the sand so urce portion of the proposal on a Go/No-Go basis.  The sand source submission will be reviewed to determine that the proposed source meets all sand criteria as outlined in the solicitation requirements and, if they do, permits will be sought.  For proposal s that meet the sand source criteria, the Government will then evaluate the remaining technical proposal and past performance submittals.  For proposals that DO NOT meet the sand source criteria, the Government will rate them NO GO and remove them from any  further consideration.  Offerors, whose sand source receives permits, will be invited to submit a price in Step 2 of the RFP evaluation.  Offerors should anticipate up to a year delay between Steps 1 and 2 of this action.  Award will be made to the offero r whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered. There will be a price preference for identified HUBZone small business concerns that comply with the requirements of the  solicitation as stipulated in FAR 19.1307.

POSITION DESCRIPTION/SOW:

I. 	BACKGROUND

USAID/Tanzania (T) is a sustainable development Mission with four strategic objectives (SOs) in Health, Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), Democracy and Governance, and Economic Growth.  The Mission is in the final phase of implementation of its Country Strategic Plan (CSP) covering the period 1997 – 2004, and is in the process of developing a new 10-year CSP for the period 2005 – 2014 (the Mission anticipates submitting the new CSP for approval in Washington by May, 2004).

The current USAID/T ENR SO Program consists of a portfolio of activities aimed at achieving the Mission’s ENR SO “Improved Conservation of Coastal and Wildlife Resources in Targeted Areas.”  The ENR SO seeks to conserve Tanzania's unique biodiversity by advancing environmental policies, legislation and improved natural resource management (NRM) practices in selected areas.  USAID/T’s approach emphasizes partnership between government and civil society that supports and informs a participatory and transparent reform process.  Four intermediate results underpin achievement of the SO: 1) Natural resource policies applied; 2) Increased effectiveness of institutions that support natural resources conservation; 3) Improved management of targeted protected areas; and 4) Community-based natural resource management regimes functioning in target areas.  The SO serves customers at three levels: 1) conservation of Tanzania's biodiversity benefits the global environment; 2) improved conservation of critical resources for a growing national economy benefits all Tanzanians; and 3) improved NRM practices benefit rural communities living in and around targeted ecosystems by providing sustainable livelihoods.  The activity portfolio of the ENR SO currently includes several large grants, one contract, and two interagency agreements.  Two of grants include public – private partnerships under USAID’s new Global Development Alliance business model.  The Mission ENR Office includes the Team Leader, two professional Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs), and one FSN Administrative Assistant.  During the current CSP, annual expenditures of the ENR SO have averaged approximately $5 million.  The ENR SO also collaborates with and co-manages several ENR activities funded out of USAID Washington offices.  The overall ENR SO is guided by a broad-based expanded SO Team that unites USAID, key Government of Tanzania (GOT) agencies, and various NGOs.  The expanded SO Team serves a central role in the management of the ENR SO portfolio.  During the current strategy period, the ENR Program has consistently performed at a high level, and served in a leadership role among donors working in the wildlife and coastal resources sectors.

The Mission has identified ENR as a key sector for the new CSP and has obtained approval from Washington to develop a new ENR SO.  The proposed new program builds on the foundation and opportunities established by the current program, increasing the attention to improving rural livelihoods, while retaining biodiversity conservation as its core goal.  The rationale for the program rests on the linkage between environment and economic growth and poverty alleviation, and the need to establish a sustainable approach to natural resource-based economic development.  The current program has set the stage for managing an appropriate balance between conservation and development, through policy and legislative reform, capacity strengthening, and pilot activities.  The proposed program will continue investment in these areas, helping Tanzania to attain and maintain that balance, while achieving significant results in areas of both biodiversity conservation and improved livelihoods.  Funding levels for the new ENR SO are expected to be in the range of $4 million per annum.  In addition, the new strategy will seek to maximize linkages between sectors, and to leverage results through integration of cross-cutting themes and tools into program approaches.  Other development sectors expected to be part of the new strategy include health, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, and democracy and governance.  Cross-cutting themes include HIV/AIDS, governance, and gender; cross-cutting tools are public-private partnerships, information and communications technology, and capacity strengthening.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information Only The Golden Field Office (GO) of the Department of Energy is interested in the acquisition of the following services: Background:  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has submitted a proposal to include Post Retirement Health Care Benefits to their suite of benefits.    This proposal was originally submitted during a period of time that DOE was concerned about  Retirement Health Care benefits or other benefits that would potentially increase DOEâ€™s future funding liabilities. Because of sustained interest on the part of NREL to make Post Retirement Health Care benefits an additional benefit, professional analysis of the proposal is being sought. Scope of Work:  The purpose of this effort is to review the data submitted by the Government to, analyze the actuarial assumptions used, risk management, benefit cost management, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and Equal Employment Opportunity considerations for the M&O Contractor supporting the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The review should consider: â€¢ All cost/value studies conducted by NREL in the last five years; â€¢ A comparison/evaluation of commercial market practices related to retiree medical benefits. The deliverable will be a final report, written so as to be easily understood by individual not necessarily knowledgeable of benefits programs,that clearly explains both the pros and cons of accepting the proposal. This action is a Request for Information ONLY.  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but is interested in obtaining small business sources capable of providing the required analysis.  Your response to this request should include your company name, experience in providing similar analysis and price estimates.  The Government will not pay for any costs associated in response to this request for information.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government as a binding contract.  Should the Government receive adequate sources an RFP may be issued. Due date for responses to this Request for Information Only: No Later Than 3:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time 30 November 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to request submissions from companies who have the ability to mechanically seed in aquatic environments.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England  District will perform habitat restoration at the Ninigret Pond, Charlestown, Rhode Island.  The purpose of this habitat restoration project is to restore submerged aquatic vegetation, in the form of eelgrass, to the flood tidal shoal of Ninigret Pond, Cha rlestown, RI.  About 40 acres of the flood tidal shoal has been dredged under separate contract to a depth of about 0.75 meters (2.5 feet) below MLW.  Eelgrass will be restored in the dredged restoration areas through a combination of direct planting and s eeding methods.  The restored beds will be planted in mosaics of patches (at a 0.5 ratio) throughout the restoration area to mimic natural beds and to allow the beds to coalesce through succession.  Monitoring of the effort (by the Corps) will take place f or three consecutive growing seasons to ensure success of the project. As part of this restoration effort, the mechanical seeding of eelgrass seeds is required to plant approximately five acres of subtidal estuarine bottom using An Underwater Seagrass Seeding Machine.  The only known machine capable of performing this type of work has been developed and patented by The University of Rhode Island.  Seeds would be required to be harvested from nearby eelgrass beds and placed in appropriate holding facilities (a flow-through seawater system with physical variable controls) for maturation.  Upon ripening, eelgrass seeds would need to be collected from the holding facility and prepared for planting (i.e., incorporated into a gel matrix to make the seeds negatively buoyant).  The Underwater Seagrass Seeding Machine, a combination  of a pumping system and mechanical sled, would be used to pump and sow the eelgrass seed/gel matrix into sediments.   Interested parties with similar type equipment and materials should submit a written notice to this office demonstrating your technology and experience to mechanically seed in aquatic environments.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mail ing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. Responses are required no later than 29 November 2004.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA  01742-2751, ATTN: Sheila Winston-Vincuilla.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation, in one original form and one copy.   Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the d ate of this notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- AFRL Det 8/PK Web Site
<DESC>The Phillips Research Site Directorate of Contracting is announcing procedures aimed at decreasing  lead-time for Broad Agency Announcement contract-awards to industry.
 
While most procedural changes are internal to the Contracting Directorate itself, the process is founded in a strategy of gathering all  information necessary for award at the onset of the acquisition, and eliminating iterative Government requests for updated, or more complete, information from the offeror.
 
The Directorate recognizes the burden levied upon industry by repeated requests for information, it is costly and time-consuming .
 
Likewise, the Directorate realizes it is incumbent on the Government to sufficiently describe the nature and detail of information required in order to make award.
   
As such, the Directorate has dedicated itself to communicating its requirements for such information to industry, and  has established the Det 8 AFRL/PK web site to facilitate this communication  (http://www.vs.afrl.af.mil/PK) , available on or about 10 Nov 2004) .  There,  the offeror will find a number of documents  to assist in developing complete and responsive offers to Phillips Research Site contracting opportunities.   
With respect to these items, interested offerors are specifically reminded:  1) To adhere to each acquisition's cost-proposal instructions; 2) To submit required subcontracting plans at the time of technical/cost-proposal submission; and 3)  That failure to provide a complete proposal may result in a determination that the proposal is non-responsive, and its elimination from consideration for award by the Government.  
 
It is the Directorate's desire to make this process as  efficient as possible for all parties, and your experiences and opinions are important to the process. We earnestly solicit your support for this initiative in the spirit of acquisition partnership and streamlining.

<SUBJECT>--Biological Standoff Detection Field Demo
<DESC>The Joint Program Manager for Contamination Avoidance (JPM-CA), Joint Biological Standoff Detection System (JBSDS) Team is sponsoring a Biological Standoff Detection Field Demo.  The Demo will be used as a technical test to evaluate potential technol ogies and/or combinations of technologies for meeting the JBSDS Increment 2 requirements.  The Field Demo is planned for Dugway Proving Ground, Utah in June 2005 with a test duration of 3 weeks (including setup).  Key requirements for JBSDS Increment 2 inc lude: Detection Sensitivity (generic cloud detection) during day and night of 1000 ACPlA at a range of 5Km. Discrimination Sensitivity (bio agent cloud vs. other cloud) during day and night conditions of 1000 ACPLA at 1 Km. False Alarm rate of 1 for every 168 hours of operation. On the move detection and discrimination (0-648 km/hr) Scan in azimuth 360 degrees and in elevation - 10 degrees to 50 degrees. 24 hour continuous operation Operationally eye and skin safe Operational temperature range of -12 to 49 degrees C Maximum Weight of 12 kg The Field Demo will include bio simulant releases in the Standoff Ambient Breeze Tunnel (S-ABT)as well as open air releases to determine the sensitivity of selected technologies and their ability to detect and track bio aerosol clouds while not false alarm ing to interferents.  The S-ABT is a 12 foot diameter, 375 foot long tunnel, open on both ends, that is used for system sensitivity measurements.  Bio aerosol simulants are disseminated within the tunnel at known concentrations.  Systems under test are typ ically situated 1 km from the tunnel opening and aligned to have a clear line of sight thru the entire tunnel length.  The JPM-CA is interested in identifying technologies for participation in the Field Demo that meet all or some of the key requirements above.  Technologies that are capable of performing in a field environment will be considered.  Selected technologies wil l be evaluated and modeled by the JPM-CA for potentital applicability in JBSDS Increment 2 by themselves or as an integrated component of multiple technologies.  The US Army is under no obligation to select any technology for the Field Demo or for future a cquisition programs.  The Field Demo will offer participants an opportunity to obtain unique performance data that can be used in their development work.  The US Army is not responsible for any costs incurred by the participants as a result of attending th is Field Demo. To be responsive to this announcement developers/sponsors must supply the following in writing to the US Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, Attn:  AMSRD-ECB-RT-DE/John Strawbridge, Building E3326, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010-5424, no later tha n close of business 8 December2004; a description of the equipment proposed that includes perrformance capabilities, technology employed and physical characteristics; a historical synopsis of the development; all pertinent test reports and performance mode ls; a photograph of the system, safety assessment (include laser safety information for laser systems) and the JBSDS Increment 2 key requirements that you anticipate demonstrating.  Also provide any improvements to the equipment that was used in prior Gove rnment testing (Joint Field Trials and TRE's). Submit information electronically via email or delivered by mail on a CD/DVD.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service – Florida announces a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Architect and Engineering firms interested in contracting for A&E Services for preparation and implementation of wetlands restoration and management plans for projects throughout Florida. 
 
Engineering services required may include but are not limited to design of earthen dikes, water control structures, and other conservation practices, surveying, hydrologic modeling, preparation of construction plans (drawings), preparation of construction specifications, preparation of cost estimates, preparation of bid schedules, preparation of design reports, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the planning, design and construction of the wetlands restoration plans.  The firm will be required to perform engineering design activities in accordance with NRCS standards and certify that designs meet NRCS standards.  A quality assurance plan will need to be prepared for construction activities.
  
The firm shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate Water Management District in the development of the wetlands restoration plan and obtain appropriate permits from the local, state, and Federal agencies.  The wetlands restoration plans shall comply with the consultation requirements of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Appropriate cultural resource compliance studies shall be conducted by individuals meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s professional qualification standards.

The purpose of wetlands restoration is to restore the natural wetland functions on the selected property to its natural condition to the maximum extent practicable by restoring the pre-drainage hydrology which includes time, depth, and duration.  The restoration design concept involves the use of water control structures, dikes, earthen blocks, etc., to maintain the water level in the wetlands at higher elevations for longer periods of time.  The design must evaluate on-site and off-site hydrologic effects and not create adverse on-site and off-site impacts.  The ultimate goal of restoration is to enhance and maintain habitat for wetland dependant wildlife.  Services required may include (1) field investigations to perform biological and cultural resource inventories, (2) preparations of biological and cultural resource evaluations, (3) design and preparation of habitat management plans, (4) certification of completed practices in accordance with NRCS standards and specifications set forth in Section IV of the Field Office Technical Guide, National Biology Manual, National Biology Handbook, National Planning Procedures Handbook and Florida supplements to these documents.

The government contemplates the award of two to three Firm-Fixed Price; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts resulting from this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options.

Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual delivery orders.  The firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $5,000 in fees for the base and each subsequent year where the option is exercised and a maximum of $500,000 in fees for each year of the contract.  Delivery Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and or environmental engineering services consisting of those needed to design and implement a wetlands restoration plan.  Specifically, engineering services are required to perform all phases of preliminary investigation, design, and construction supervision of structures and other practices as needed for successful implementation and operation of a wetlands restoration plan.  Services requested may require (1) field investigations to perform engineering surveys, geologic and soils investigations, (2) design and preparation of engineering plans and construction specifications, (3) performance of construction layout and certification of completed practices in accordance with NRCS standards, specifications, policy and documentation requirements as set forth in Section IV of the Field Office Technical Guide, National Engineering Manual, National Engineering Handbook, the Engineering Field Handbook, and Florida supplements to the referenced handbooks.

These contracts could include design for repair and replacement of existing systems, design review of other A&E firms, and construction inspection services.  Services may involve direct consultation, supervision and inspection of construction for a specific project, including reviews and approvals of shop drawings, material selections, and quality control testing such as those associated with concrete placement and earth fill compaction.  Responses should include proposed sub-consultants for all disciplines including civil, agricultural, environmental, geo-technical, biologist, cultural resource specialist, and soil mechanics engineering.  Responses should also include the qualification of personnel and description of facilities, materials, equipment and services to perform the type of tasks described by this notice.  The preparation of construction and design documents in electronic format and with approved NRCS computer software is required.  All design drawings must be submitted using AutoCAD, version 2000 or later or other similar CAD software that is directly convertible to AutoCAD.

The estimated value of the proposed construction projects is between $1 million and $5 million.  Funding is through the NRCS WRP program. 
 
PRESELECTION CRITERIA.  Project manager must be a Registered Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Florida.
Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit an SF330 (form SF254 and SF255 may be submitted in lieu of an SF330) to Lynn Merrill, Contract Specialist, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2614 NW 43rd Street, Gainesville, FL 32606-6611.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the SMDC DARPA office.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit pr oposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these enti ties.  4.	Contracts, grants, or assistance instruments may be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. Notice of the Broad Agency Announcement shall be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (fedbizopps.gov) and Federal Grant Opportunities (fedgrant s.gov) websites. 5.	In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that offerors first submit a summary white paper for preliminary consideration.  Summary whi te papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA through the expiration date thereof (9 November 2005).  White papers will be considered as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgment of receipt of white papers will not be made, and white p apers will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in the strictest confidence.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in proposal preparation and review.  The SMDC DARPA Office will  ask only those offerors with promising white papers to submit full technical and cost proposals for formal evaluation.  The SMDC DARPA Office will notify offerors within six (6) months of white paper receipt if a full proposal is requested.  White papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.   6.	Formal BAA proposals may be submitted without submission and review of a white paper. Offerors are encouraged to use the Summary White Paper process described above and may submit a formal proposal even if the government does not request it.  Issuance o f the BAA or any request for submission of a proposal does not obligate the Gov ernment to pay any proposal preparation costs. PART I -  WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION 1.	The summary white paper should, in summary, capture the proposed technical concept together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, and its contribution to the USASMDC.

This announcement will become effective upon publication and will remain open for one year from date of publication.   PART III - EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it related to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exis ts.  Proposals will be evaluated monthly. The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.   1.	General:  The Government selection of the proposal (s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation cri teria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. 2.	Evaluation Areas/Factors 	a.	Technical Area.  The quality of the offeror's technical approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1)	Overall Scientific/Technical Quality  The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with sp ecial emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness. 		(2)	Qualifications  Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. 		(3)	Research and Development Contribution  Potential contribution of the proposed research to USASMDC in the above technology areas. 	b.	Management Area.  The quality of the offeror's proposed management approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1) Overall Scheduling and Planning  The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. 		(2) Expenditure Control  The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. 	c.	Cost Area 		The cost area is comprised of two evaluation factors; cost realism and total evaluated probable cost.  The cost realism and total evaluated probable cost to the government of the proposed work will be evaluated using the following: 		a.  Cost Realism:  The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed.  Cost realism will be evaluated but not rated. 		b.  Total Evaluated Probable Cost:  The proposal  will be evaluated to develop the governments estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. 	d.	Relative importance of Evaluation Criteria 		(1)  Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 		(2)  Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 		(3)	Cost:  (a)  The cost area is a substantial evaluation factor, however, it is less important than each of the technical and management areas.  (b)  Cost realism is a very important consideration in the evaluation of the technical and management areas.  Poor cost realism may result in a lower evaluation of the technical and management areas.  3.	Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value consid erations, availability of funds, and program balance.  In some cases, the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to USASMDC goals. PART V - OTHER INFORMATION 1.	The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Issuance of the BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  Offerors will be notified of selection for award approximately 45 days after government receipt of the propos als.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals not selected for immediate funding may be considered for a period of 6 months. 2.	Cost Plus Fixed Fee completion and/or level of effort contracts are expected to be awarded.  Contracts, grants, and other transaction awards will be considered.  For planning purposes, awards are anticipated from $100,000 to $5M for the basic contract w ith a period of performance not to exceed 12 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four (4) options can be proposed.  However, the total contract value for the basic and options cannot exceed $45M and the total period of performance for the bas ic and options cannot exceed 72 months.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of final report.   3.	Any necessary coordination of facility use will be performed by the offeror.   4.	The number and types of reports will be specified in the award document. However, the following are the titles, data item description (DID) numbers, and frequency of data items anticipated to be delivered during contract performance: 		(1)  STATUS REPORT,  			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: Monthly/Quarterly	 		(2)  FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT 			DI-FNCL-80331, Submission: monthly 		(3)  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL REPORTS SUMMARY 			DI-MISC-80048, Special Technical Report,  			Submission: As required by events 		(4)  OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) PLAN, One-time  			(if required) 		(5)  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN 			DI-IPSC-81427A (if required) 		(6)  STATUS REPORT, FINAL REPORT 			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: One Time 5.	Security Requirements:  While non-classified work is relevant, research at SMDC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This is not always known ahead of time, and when it does the applicant must be p repared to deal with classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended.

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW), past performance, and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror¡¯s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are of equal importance; a neutral rating will be given to offerors without past performance experience.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government's intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.
 
Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

Past Performance:  

Offerors shall provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror's customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror's record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror's quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001-00003; Quantity:  Various; 150 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001-0003; Quantity:  Various; 210 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term 'working day' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Acceptance will be by the Ministry of Transportation, Baghdad, Iraq.  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation ¨C Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation:  (1) a price proposal which shows the proposed unit price for each line item, the extended total price for each line item, and the total overall price for all contract line items; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the SOW but not exceeding the clause at 52.212-1; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractors Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractors Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration database in order to receive payment, should they receive a Government contract award!

The Offerors will provide no more than two pages of past performance information.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.

Questions regarding this quotation should be directed to Mr. Charles Clements at email charles.clements@cpa-iq.org; faxed quotes will NOT be accepted.  2.  Question:  Do the cars have to be "new" equipment or can they be "refurbished" equipment? 

Answer:  Yes, they must be new equipment

3.  Question:  The End Doors are Sliding Pneumatic Doors.  What are the types of doors required on the side?  Swing or Pneumatic?

Answer:  Side entrance doors are “electropneumatic swing sliding doors”
 
4.  Question:  We do not have specifications for the Bombardier MD523-1.  Are they available to the public anywhere?

Answer:  Specifications and pricing for Bombardier MD523-1 bogies can be obtained by contacting the Bombardier Company at:

Bombardier Transportation Bogies
Siegstrasse 27
57250 Netphen
Germany
Telephone: +49 271 702-0
Fax: +49 271 702-222
http://www.bombardier.com

5.  Question:  The Bogie wheel base seems to be incorrect.  Instead of 600 mm, should it be 2600 mm to 2800 mm?

Answer:  The bogie wheel base should be 2500 mm to 2800 mm. The bogie must be the Bombardier MD523-1 bogies.  Contact the Bombardier Company for the exact dimension on the wheel base if necessary.  

6.  Question:  The Knorr Bremse brake system with 2/pipes of 8 and 5 bars.  We are familiar with the Knorr brake system.  Is there a difference with that and what you are requesting?

8.  Question:  The specifications require air-tight perfect seal rubber gangways.  We can not find a 100% perfect seal.  Due to the sand in Iraq this may be impossible to obtain.  Is it necessary for the rubber gangways and the side doors?  

Answer:  A near perfect  seal  is acceptable, given the environment.  Maintaining a positive air pressure in the coaches will help achieve a sand/dust-free environment.

9.  Question:  Can you enlighten us on your definition of Eastern versus Western style restrooms?

Answer:  Western style restrooms have sit-down toilets and Eastern style restrooms have squat-type toilets
