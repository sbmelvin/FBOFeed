<p>Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriate funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>

<CONTACT>Patrick J Winders, Phone 7704882669, Email vxx6@cdc.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. <br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Centers Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Reproductive Health contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price Sole Source Purchase Order to Michigan Public Health Institute (Okemos, MI). The work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility. The Period of Performance shall be for 12 months. The North American Industrial Classification Standards (NAICS) Code is 541690 and Standard Business Size of $7M. <br /><br />The sole source award will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This requirement is a continuation of services already provided and is not set aside for small businesses. <br />The objective of this procurement is to provide training and technical assistance to grantees of the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry (SUID-CR) under Cooperative Agreement DP09-904 and the upcoming Cooperative Agreement DP12-12 as they collect review and enter SUID case information. Specifically, Michigan Public Health Institute's National Center for Child Death Review (NCCDR) will conduct site visits to ensure compliance with grant objectives and the NCCDR manual of procedures and train grantees to conduct effective reviews with comprehensive information and how to make practice and policy changes that improve infant death investigation and ultimately prevent SUID. Additionally, the NCCDR will provide quarterly data sets from their Case Reporting system. The data compiled in this NCCDR system forms the basis of the SUID Case Registry's surveillance of SUID, and without it, the CDC would be unable to achieve the SUID Case Registry program objectives. <br /><br />The Michigan Public Health Institute is the only organization with an established mortality review program that allows for the review of population-based SUID data from multiple sources, web -based data entry, and data sharing with the CDC. In order to provide technical assistance and training, an organization would need to access the data, be familiar with the data dictionary, know how to download the data and import it into statistical software. The SUID data is proprietary and owned only by the states who voluntarily share the data with the NCCDR; however, the Michigan Public Health Institute has a data sharing agreement with the states and with the CDC. To provide the necessary training and technical assistance activities, an organization would have to have access to the data and have an understanding of the child death review program functions in each state and locality. <br /><br />CDC is not requesting competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the services required are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, by April 19, 2012. Determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquiries may be sent to Patrick Winders via email at vxx6@cdc.gov.

The requirement will include the purchase of HD encryption systems and accessories, as well as, spare equipment parts. On-site installation and implementation services will also be required by certified expert-level Cisco personnel in the following locations: DMA-BC, Riverside, California; DMA-HQ, Ft. Meade, Maryland; DMA-AFN Europe, Manheim, Germany; and DMA-AFN South, Vicenza, Italy.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a large purchase for NSN 4720-00-053-4577. Specifications, drawings or standards are not available from the Government. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only offers based on approved sources under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) 1. Current approved manufacturers are EATON-AEROQUIP INC. (3E6R6) P/N EH63138-93 and SARGENT FLETCHER INC. (72429) P/N 128B5030-11. This solicitation opens on 4/23/12 and closes 5/23/12. This requirement is for a quantity of 173 each. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based on combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: Unrestricted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br /><br />ITEM DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />&nbsp; HOSE, NONMETALLIC.<br />&nbsp; 2-3/8 IN.

To view and/or download Export Controlled Materials, a company must be certified (via an approved DD Form 2345) by the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS), reference web address http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.  This certification establishes that a company is a U.S. or Canadian contractor eligible to receive unclassified technical data that is under the control of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND).  Questions about this program or DD Form 2345 should be addressed to U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS), Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084; or telephone (616) 961-4358, toll free (800) 352-3572; or email jcp-admin@dla.mil.

When the Contractor clicks to open an export controlled package/document, they should be asked for their MPIN.  After entering the MPIN, the export controlled package/document should be viewable/downloadable by Contractors that have gone through the JCP process.  If a Contractor still has problems, the Contractor should check to make sure that their CCR registration and MPIN are valid and up-to-date.

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid. The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to identify potential Offerors for the replacement of four floating finger piers at Quay  9, Jebel-Ali, UAE. 

The contractor shall provide all the necessary materials, tools, labor, and supervision to dispose the existing finger pier and design, build, and install four new floating finger piers. The proposed finger piers shall have a new configuration, which includes a wider 1.3-m (4.3-foot) and longer 9.0-m (29.6-foot) finger deck that replaces the existing 0.8-m (2.6-foot) by 8.0-m (26.2-foot) version. The new finger piers shall have a rectangular-shaped float and a total of four rubber link connections.
 The basic dock structure consists of the flotation pontoon, the structural frame, and the deck. Flotation pontoons shall consist of a foam core completely encapsulated in a protective shell to prevent contact with water or other deleterious elements. The foam generally consists of expanded polystyrene (EPS) closed cell blocks, but other types of foam may be used. Although the foam should be protected by the shell from water contact; certain materials may lose their water-tightness over time. This shall be acceptable if the maximum water absorption of the EPS core is limited to less than 3% as determined by ASTM Standard C272, Method C, the amount of reground material is limited to less than 10%, and the form core is preformed to the interior configuration of the pontoon as a solid block.
 Deck surface shall withstand prolonged exposure to the elements (sunlight, wetting/drying, freezing/thawing etc.), severe abrasion by scuffing and dropped objects, and fatigue due to dock motions and flexing. Further, the surface shall be non-skid, and resistant to staining by spills and dirt. Additional details and specifications will be posted together with the full solicitation.

This is a negotiated procurement utilizing single phase design build selection procedures. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions based on a successful offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. Selection for award will be based on Experience, Safety, Past Performance, and Technical Solution.

The completion time for this contract is 240 calendar days after award.
 

The Solicitation will be available in electronic format only.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued around mid/late April 2012. The solicitation will be listed as N33191-12-R-1020 on the European Navy Electronic Commerce Online website (EURONECO) at: https://euro.neco.navy.mil. A Vendor User Guide is available for download at the site, as well as the EuroNECO Help Desk contact phone number for any issues/questions related to the website.

The Contractor shall maintain sufficient parts, materials and equipment on hand to support service call work requirements and complete all work within two calendar days.  Lack of availability of parts, material, or equipment will not relieve the Contractor from the requirement to complete service call work within the time limits specified.
  The Contractor shall perform the annual and semi-annual inspection and testing for each VTE in accordance with but not limited to ASME A17.1, A17.2 and A17.3, NFPA, NEC, ANSI and MO118.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source cost reimbursement contract to: Chestnut Health Systems, 1003 Martin Luther King Dr, Bloomington, IL 61701 to provide acquisition support for the training, monitoring, coaching and certification to approximately 37 grantee sites of the Assertive Adolescent and Family Treatment grant program (AAFT) see the grant application announcement at http://www.samhsa.gov/Grants/2010/TI-10-002.aspx.<br /><br />The AAFT Grant Program requires the use of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) and the Adolescent Community Reinforcement (A-CRA) and Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) clinical protocols. The Request for Applications for the Grant Program specified that the cost of training, monitoring and certification in the GAIN, ACRA and ACC would be borne by the Federal Government. Chestnut Health Systems served as the Coordinating Center for the Cannabis Youth Treatment Study in which the GAIN and ACRA were developed and tested. Chestnut Health Systems also developed the ACC Protocol. Chestnut Health Systems holds the copyright for the GAIN and is the sole training organization for the GAIN, A-CRA and ACC. Training, monitoring, coaching and certification require a national center for overseeing these activities that will be from disparate locations throughout the United States and its Territories. The training, monitoring, coaching and certification are in the GAIN assessment and follow up instruments; and the A-CRA, and ACC clinical protocols. The outcomes of this contract will be nationally trained and certified administrators and trainers of GAIN, and nationally trained and certified clinicians and clinical supervisors of A-CRA and ACC. At the end of the base year contract period the grantee sites will be equipped to train and certify their own personnel in GAIN, A-CRA and ACC. Chestnut Health Systems will operate and maintain a data base, updated monthly and forwarded to SAMHSA/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment on the progress and implementation of these tools in their sites. A minimum of 100 individuals will be trained, monitored, coached and certified in these approaches.
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within forty five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (RDC) has a requirement for a follow-on Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) advisory and assistance services contract in order to execute its projects under the CG Acquisition Directorate. The RDC is organizationally aligned under the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Program Office (CG-926) in the Acquisition Directorate (CG-9). RDC is a strategic USCG resource and the sole CG facility performing RDT&amp;E in support of the major missions of Maritime Law Enforcement, Maritime Safety, Marine Environmental Protection and National Security. RDC supports CG acquisition and regulatory processes and strives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CG operations and resources. RDC is also the Coast Guard's principal systems analysis center supporting key acquisition decisions. RDC needs to augment the capacity, acquisition experience, and technological expertise in its role as advisor and consultant to CG-9 and their sponsors. This augmentation will result in a long-term partnership to provide support of major and non-major systems throughout the acquisition lifecycle. RDC support to acquisition teams typically involves complex analyses that require multidisciplinary technical integration of expertise in the following areas: requirements, alternatives, cost and operations analysis; systems engineering and planning; human systems integration; environmental impact and safety assessments; logistics; test and evaluation; scientific and technical studies; and acquisition strategy.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Morphix Technologies, 2557 Production Road, Virginia Beach, VA 23454. The USCG has an immediate need to procure a sensitive, selective, durable, lightweight customized kit of eight (8) chemical detector cassettes that provide an immediate visual indication of the presence of a chemical hazard without the need for a liquid sample. It enables the war-fighter and first responder to visually monitor, in real time, the presence of hazardous chemicals simultaneously. The cassettes must be compatible with the Chameleon Chemical armband produced by Morphix Technologies.</p>
<p>Morphix Technologies is the only manufacturer that is capable of producing an acceptable maritime chemical detection system for the U.S. Coast Guard that has been tested and verified by an independent US Government laboratory. Testing and verification requires the detection cassettes to be fully capable to be worn for an extended period of time in an operational environment (land and maritime), diverse weather climates/environments and be submerged in salt/fresh water for extended periods. The Department of Defense has completed its verification of the Morphix Technologies detection cassettes for the intended operational environment. Additionally, the USCG has completed extended operational evaluations during its 13 month WMD response test and evaluation program. As a result of this verification process, the lightweight chemical detectors have been approved for use by the USCG in a maritime environment that contains chemical agents.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, if your firm currently has a certified product in accordance with the requirements stated herein, you may submit a proposal for consideration. If the proposal is received by 5:00 PM PST, Thursday, April 19, 2012 it will be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this request for information (RFI)/sources sought is in support of market intelligence being conducted by the 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market to perform services under a potential/future Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) IV indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. This RFI/sources sought shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and costs associated with this or any follow-up information submission shall not be paid by the Government
<p>Sources are sought to perform actions within the scope of the AFCAP program:</p>
<p>AFCAP is intended to provides commanders and/or any Government entity a worldwide, responsive, force multiplier option to augment or relieve base operating support (BOS) functions participating in a wide range of support focusing on temporary contingency skills and/or resources to sustain military forces participating in a wide spectrum of activities (e.g. disaster response, Overseas Contingency Operation, Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW), humanitarian response, nation building, etc.), to include disaster recovery (natural disaster such as hurricane recovery) ranging from a geographical theater of operations to global-scale response in minimal time. Capabilities the contractor will be required to provide are planning and deployment support. Planning is expected to be available within the contractor's program management team and other company resources and deployment capabilities are expected to be obtained as required for site-specific requirements. The capabilities under the contemplated contract are intended to support the Air Force, any DoD component, any Governmental entity operating in support of missions which could include National Command Authority, joint or combined United States military forces acting as part of or in concert with United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational force, or other entities. Support can include a wide spectrum of response potentials to meet requirements within and outside the continental United States. The principal effort of this contract will be to provide deployment capabilities generally aligned with Air Force combat support and combat service support functions associated with BOS, to include the "Civil Engineer" and "Services" career fields and to provide logistic support that reduces a dependence on scarce war reserve material stockpiles, fills manpower shortfalls, or provides Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO) relief. A list of skills typically required include: carpentry, plumbing, electrical, mechanical (e.g., refrigeration, air conditioning, heat, controls, etc.), heavy equipment operations and/or leases, paint, power production, food service, lodging management, recreational services, housekeeping services, laundry plant operation, various utility plant operations (e.g., water, sewage, solid waste disposal, etc.), structural fire protection and fire crash rescue, unexploded ordnance (UXO) technician (e.g., clearing sub-scale practice bombs), emergency management, professional engineering, project and program management, transportation, communications, and just-in-time commodities to support mission objectives.</p>
<p>Respondents capable of satisfying the requirements stated herein should send an electronic copy of their response within 30 days of this publication to Dennis W Rogers, Dennis.Rogers@Tyndall.AF.MIL, Contracting Officer, 722 ESS/PKHA, 139 Barnes Drive, Suite 1, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403-5319.

<RESPDATE>050412
<CONTACT>Estela M. Diaz, "CARPOL SOLUTIONS", Phone n/a, Fax n/a, Email CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought: Certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) systems currently in the market.
<p>Objective: To gather industry information regarding existing CARPOL-related systems and services.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) is seeking government, industry, and academic input for information related to Web-based systems and services that currently support certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) activities. Specifically, we want to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify other State and Federal Government agencies, commercial, and academic entities that provide CARPOL services to the public<br />&bull; Learn about the processes, technology, systems, and services that are being used to support CARPOL activities<br />&bull; Determine the best practices for delivering CARPOL services<br />&bull; Determine what functional requirements were used to develop or acquire CARPOL systems<br />&bull; Determine how CARPOL systems are being funded before and after implementation<br />&bull; Leverage lessons learned from the development of CARPOL services<br />&bull; Identify private-sector resources that may provide CARPOL systems or services<br />&bull; Determine what methods others have used to build their existing infrastructures (e.g., software, hardware, middleware, funding) to support CARPOL-related activities<br />APHIS is organizationally located under USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP). MRP's mission is to facilitate domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and ensure the health and wellbeing of animals and plants. The overarching goals of the USDA MRP agencies are:</p>
<p>&bull; Faster delivery of services and products<br />&bull; Improved customer relations<br />&bull; Incorporation of efficiency and innovation into operational solutions<br />&bull; Perpetuation of effective change management<br />APHIS' mission is threefold:</p>
<p>(1) provide leadership in ensuring the health and wellbeing of animals and plants, (2) improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and (3) contribute to the national economy and public health. In supporting USDA's mission to protect American agriculture and natural resources, APHIS issues CARPOL authorizations of various forms to allow the movement of specifically regulated agricultural commodities into and through the United States.</p>
<p>APHIS currently provides a Web-based system for users to apply for permits, check the status of their permit applications, and view issued permits. The system is integrated with the U.S. Department of Treasury www.pay.gov site to process payments of any fees. Federal import permitting officials use the APHIS system workflow capabilities to review the applications and issue permits. In addition, Federal and State enforcement officials use the APHIS system to verify the validity of import permits. <br />The current system has approximately 22,000 registered users, and processes nearly 33,000 applications and issues 27,000 permits annually. The system users include APHIS import permitting officials; other Federal Government employees; State agriculture officials; and private individuals, universities, and businesses. The system exchanges data with separate systems utilized by other Federal Government agencies that are also involved in the inspection and movement of imported commodities under APHIS' regulatory authority. These other agencies include the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Internally, Plant Inspection Stations and Investigative and Enforcement Services staff use the system to validate permits and exchange data with several IT systems. In addition to the current Web-based system, APHIS has other CARPOL processes that interact with the import permitting process as well as other electronic sources of structured CARPOL data. The USDA and its cooperators issue approximately 550,000 permit-type certificates per year.</p>
<p>APHIS' primary goal is to have one flexible, expandable system that will fulfill its common data needs for CARPOL services and that optimizes user productivity, maximizes data value, and is compliant with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and directives. APHIS seeks to expand and improve its sharing, reporting, and analytical capabilities of CARPOL data and business processes. The foundation of a replacement system or service will be improved business processes identified in a business process assessment and reengineering final product produced by APHIS. An additional goal is to leverage, where possible, current technology and other resources. <br />All interested market sources are encouraged to respond with the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Title and description of system.<br />&bull; Type of entity the system supports (Federal or State government, academic, commercial, or other).<br />&bull; Name of contractor or other entity supporting the system, including point of contact for additional information (name, address, telephone number, and email) and business status (small, large, or AbilityOne).<br />&bull; Name of customer (owner of the system or data), including point of contact (name, address, telephone number, and email).</p>
<p>Sources responding to this posting are responsible for appropriately marking any information that is proprietary in nature.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Therefore, no proposals will be accepted. No contracts will result from any submission. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received; nor will the Government reimburse participants for information provided.</p>
<p>Information requested is strictly voluntary and is for informational purposes only. Responses must be emailed to CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov and include the phrase "CARPOL Solutions" in the subject line. No telephone communication will be accepted. Sources responding to this notice will not be entitled to the results.</p>

<DESC><br>1.	INTRODUCTION<br><br>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by Product Director Enterprise Email (PD EE) to provide the Army with a better understanding of potential industry solutions to its' Secure Public-use Common Access Card Reader requirement.  The Secure Public-use Common Access Card (CAC) Reader will be a critical enabler of the Army's deployment of CAC-enabled enterprise solutions, enabling users to securely access CAC-enabled applications from public computing devices, within the limited security tolerance of these devices, and without installing client software or middleware on the public device.<br><br>Responses to this RFI will assist the Army in determining if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Army's Secure Public-use Common Access Card Reader requirement and whether commercial or non-developmental items are available that meet these requirements.  Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI, the PD EE may invite select RFI respondents to further discuss their solution with Government representatives. <br><br>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition.  All information received from this RFI will be used for Market Research purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise reimburse vendors for the preparation of any information submitted or Government use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified regarding the outcome of the information received.<br><br>1.1.	Army PD EE and PEO EIS Background<br><br>Product Director Enterprise Email is a component of the Army Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS).  Product Manager Enterprise Email is responsible for fielding capabilities which support the Army's Enterprise Email and related services; the Secure Public-use Common Access Card Reader requirement is a critical capability which will extend the Enterprise Email solution as well as other CAC-enabled applications.<br><br>Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems provides infrastructure and information management systems to the Army, enabling it to achieve victory through total information dominance. PEO EIS develops, acquires and deploys tactical and management information technology systems and products.  PEO EIS is a systems acquisition, development and integration center of excellence under the management of four deputy program executive officers, five directorates and numerous project/product managers.  PEO EIS develops and fields a wide range of products and services that support the Army and, through its diverse programs, touches every soldier, every day.  <br><br>1.2.	Army's Secure Public-use Common Access Card Reader Requirement<br><br>The Army utilizes Common Access Card authentication to enable user access to a host of applications access over local and wide area networks, as well as the internet and World Wide Web.  The computing devices through which these applications are accessed require a CAC reader and the associated certificates for authentication, available as a matter of course in Army provided desktop computing devices.   Supporting infrastructure enabling the use of Common Access Card and associated devices has been established to enable and maintain the CAC solution.<br><br>There is, however, a need to provide the same authentication method for users who regularly or periodically have access only to public computing devices at hotels, library, internet kiosks, and other non-Government facilities.  These public computers do not commonly include attached CAC readers, nor do they include or enable the installation of client software (including certificates) and the middleware required to attach an external CAC reader.  Thus, the user attempting to access a CAC-enabled application is unable to do so from a public venue, greatly limiting productivity and user satisfaction.<br><br>In particular, one example of a critical CAC-enabled application is DoD Enterprise Email.  DoD Enterprise Email is currently using MS Exchange 2010, and CAC PKI certificates are required for authentication and for S/MIME functionality.  Because S/MIME functionality in Exchange 2010 webmail is provided using ActiveX, Internet Explorer is the only browser that currently enables webmail S/MIME functionality.<br><br>The Army seeks a device that enables individuals to easily use a public computer by simply plugging in the Reader and which provides the requisite functionality without requiring any special (elevated) user privileges.  Key requirements for the Army Secure Public-use Common Access Card (CAC) Reader include:<br>a.	The Army Secure Public-use Common Access Card (CAC) Reader must be entirely self-contained.<br>b.	The device must appear as a read-only device to the operating systems and not require any drivers or other software to be installed before it can be used. <br>c.	The Army Secure Public-use Common Access Card (CAC) Reader must either have middleware resident/installed (or be able to interact directly with the certificates on the CAC) so that CAC certificates are automatically available to Windows and the browser.<br>d.	The Army Secure Public-use Common Access Card (CAC) Reader must include, resident on the device, an internet browser that provides full S/MIME functionality (encrypt, sign, decrypt) with MS Exchange 2010 (or higher) OWA using certificates on the CAC, and full PKI certificate authentication to access .mil and other PKI-enabled websites.  <br>e.	The browser loaded on the device will need to be updated and receive patches and updates to maintain currency, functionality, and availability, of the browser.<br>f.	The device must protect any data and applications resident on the CAC Reader in the event of theft or loss.<br>g.	The device must function on a full range of MS operating systems, including XP, Vista, and Win 7.  It is preferred that the device also function with Apple operating systems.<br><br>PD EE is currently exploring potential technical solutions to this requirement -- this RFI and the resulting responses are intended to enable the Army to make informed decisions as to the best solution for meeting this requirement.<br><br>2.	RFI INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>Responses to this RFI are requested in four (4) parts.  First, the Army seeks to identify the companies that provide products that will meet the requirements listed above.  Second, the Army seeks a description of the device, its capabilities, limitations, etc.  Third, the Army seeks to understand the extent to which the device has been deployed and its current usage.  Finally, the Army seeks answers to specific technical matters as listed in section 6 of this document.<br><br>Response submissions should be submitted in Microsoft Word format and should not exceed twenty (20) pages with Arial font greater than or equal to 10 pt.   Respondents are strongly urged to adhere to this page limitation as well as to limit marketing material in order to provide more substantive information in their response.  Responses are to be submitted via e-mail to Elvia Jaggers at elvia.jaggers.civ@mail.mil no later than 1700 EDT 18 April 2012.<br><br>3.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA Glenn Research Center to post a Request forInformation (RFI) via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties.  Thisdocument is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunityto verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promotecompetition.  When responding, please reference the RFI Number.The objective of this project is to develop an integrated electric propulsion system toTRL 6 that demonstrates the combination of thrust, specific impulse, and efficiencyrequired for human exploration architectures and a possible technology demonstrationmission to begin as early as 2018. The system shall include the thruster,power-processing unit (PPU), propellant feed system, and digital control interface unit(which may be incorporated into the PPU). The proposed system shall offer advantages at asystem level over state-of-the-art flight systems, specifically focused on higher powerand higher efficiency.	NASA is particularly interested in system development approachesthat leverage prior technology investments and heritage solutions as means of reducingdevelopment time, cost and risks. To better understand these factors any cost, schedule,or technology risks to providing the requested system should be clearly identified.The project must include sufficient testing to show compliance with the requested systemspecifications as listed below. The relevant environment as defined for the TRL 6assessment may include those encountered anywhere from low Earth orbit (LEO) all the wayto heliocentric space. Since candidate missions may include spiraling out through thehigh radiation environment of the Van Allen belts radiation tolerance is also requested.At a minimum a TRL 6 assessment shall include component environmental tests showing therequired functionality and environmental compatibility and an integrated propulsionsystem functional test in a suitable space simulation chamber. The top-level specifications for the requested system are:Electrical characteristics:  System input power in excess of 10kW (as measured at the PPU input) with a &#8805;12kW goal.  PPU compatible with a primary power input at 170VDC  10% and a secondary power input(if needed) at 28VDC  15%.  The PPU efficiency in the identified input voltage range above and reducing PPUcomplexity/cost are the primary parameters of interest.  Additional flexibility on the PPU input voltage is recognized as beneficial and anyoptions available that could meet the goals without significant cost and schedule impactsshould be discussed  Conducted and radiated emissions compatible with MIL-STD-461EPerformance & lifetime characteristics:  The system should be capable of providing thrust at a specific impulse ofapproximately 2000 seconds with a total system efficiency of &#8805;0.60 at full power.  System throttle-ability is recognized as beneficial below the full-power operatingpoint and should be discussed in regards to capability and performance at lower powerlevels and higher specific impulses.  The system should be capable of full power continuous operation for &#8805; 10,000hours.  The system should be capable of a minimum of 5,000 on/off cycles. Thermal characteristics:  The thruster should be able to operate at steady state under full power with anadiabatic thermal mounting interface.    The PPU should be capable of operating over its entire operating range of inputs andoutputs in all anticipated space environments while mounted to a temperature controlledbase plate anywhere between -20&#730;C to 50&#730;C.Telemetry and control:  The system should be compatible with a MIL-STD-1553 data bus control interface.  The system should provide sufficient telemetry outputs to permit health and statusmonitoring. Mechanical characteristics:  The system should be compatible with the following launch, ascent, and on-orbitenvironments:  Static and dynamic loads  Thermal environments  EMI/EMC environments  Vibration environments (sine and random vibration)  Vibroacoustic environments (acoustic induced vibration environments)  Shock environments (pyrotechnic and mechanically induced shock)Definition of NASA Technology Readiness LevelTRL 6 Definition:  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevantenvironment.Hardware Description:  A high-fidelity system/component prototype that adequatelyaddresses all critical scaling issues is built and operated in a relevant environment todemonstrate operations under critical environmental conditions.Exit Criteria: Documented test performance demonstrating agreement with analyticalpredictions.PURPOSE OF RFIThe information obtained may be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategydevelopment.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sontek/YSI Incorporated, of Olympia., WA for two 250KHz acoustic Doppler profilers and accessories.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS) needs to collect, analyze and distribute historical and real-time observations and predictions of water levels, coastal currents, and other metrological and oceanographic data. This purchase is for stationary mounted side looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) which provides information about currents critical for marine transportation within Humboldt Bay. They are being put in the area to improve the safety of marine transportation. Other products lack the particular features, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. This equipment is already in use in the field by CO-OPs personnel and contractors with training to calibrate and repair the systems. To introduce another system would require training of field personnel and contractors plus the added expense of purchasing additional parts to repair the systems at a cost to the Government. Therefore it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase the current equipment in use.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the needed services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within&nbsp;4 days after publication of this posting. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

The intent is to identify potential small business sources with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirement stated herein, and detailed in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) referenced below.
The requirement is for ?Greenhouse Gas Inventory Estimates for Agriculture, and Capacity Building on Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Developing (Non-Annex I) Countries,? supporting the mission of carbon management and greenhouse gas mitigation within the Climate Change Division of the Environmental Protection Agency. This requirement is a continuation and expansion of the current work provided by Colorado State University under the fixed rate, time and material contract EP-W-08-013: National Agriculture Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reporting of Soil Organic Carbon and Nitrous Oxide Emissions. Prospective contractors are required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities to perform the following tasks:  Greenhouse Gas Inventory Improvements for the Annual US Greenhouse Gas Inventory; Annual agricultural soil carbon stock change and soil nitrous oxide emission estimates and representation of US land base for inclusion in the annual submission of  the ?Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks;? Greenhouse Gas Inventory Capacity Building in Developing Countries; Quick Turnaround Assignments related to source and sink categories  covered under the Agriculture and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sectors. The current contract is scheduled to expire 13 January 2013. EPA anticipates awarding a fixed rate, time and materials contract with a one year base and four, one-year option years at an estimated total value of $3.1M (inclusive of options).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is:  541330 - Engineering Services.

The requirement is to use Combat Support Training Center installations to train Army Reserve and Active Component unit training. One of these installations is Fort Hunter-Liggett, CA. This project will provide a 700 person Operational Readiness Training Complex with administrative, educational, barracks, dining, storage and vault space. The maintenance shop will provide work bays and maintenance administrative support. The project will also provide adequate parking for all military and privately-owned vehicles.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>A.	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in   multiple crafts or trades. <br><br>B.	The complexity of the project. <br><br>C.	Shortage of skilled labor in region.<br> <br>D.	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br><br>E.	The use of PLAs on other comparable projects.<br> <br>F.	The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br> <br>G.	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br> <br>H.	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. <br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br><br>A.      Should a PLA be executed on the Fort Hunter-Liggett, CA Operational Readiness Training Complex contract? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>B.	Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>C.	Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br><br>D.	Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>E.	The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br><br>F.	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br><br>G.	Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>H.	Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br><br>I.	Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br><br>Responses shall be submitted via email to Misty Jones at misty.d.jones@usace.army.mil no later than 1100 EST on 18 April 2012.  Note:  PDF format is not preferred.<br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<br>

<DESC>Sources Sought: Certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) systems currently in the market.
<p>Objective: To gather industry information regarding existing CARPOL-related systems and services.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) is seeking government, industry, and academic input for information related to Web-based systems and services that currently support certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) activities. Specifically, we want to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify other State and Federal Government agencies, commercial, and academic entities that provide CARPOL services to the public.<br />&bull; Learn about the processes, technology, systems, and services that are being used to support CARPOL activities.<br />&bull; Determine the best practices for delivering CARPOL services.<br />&bull; Determine what functional requirements were used to develop or acquire CARPOL systems.<br />&bull; Determine how CARPOL systems are being funded before and after implementation.<br />&bull; Leverage lessons learned from the development of CARPOL services.<br />&bull; Identify private-sector resources that may provide CARPOL systems or services.<br />&bull; Determine what methods others have used to build their existing infrastructures (e.g., software, hardware, middleware, funding) to support CARPOL-related activities<br />APHIS is organizationally located under USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP). MRP's mission is to facilitate domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and ensure the health and wellbeing of animals and plants. The overarching goals of the USDA MRP agencies are:<br />&bull; Faster delivery of services and products<br />&bull; Improved customer relations<br />&bull; Incorporation of efficiency and innovation into operational solutions<br />&bull; Perpetuation of effective change management</p>
<p>APHIS' mission is threefold:<br />(1) provide leadership in ensuring the health and wellbeing of animals and plants, (2) improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and (3) contribute to the national economy and public health.</p>
<p>In supporting USDA's mission to protect American agriculture and natural resources, APHIS issues CARPOL authorizations of various forms to allow the movement of specifically regulated agricultural commodities into and through the United States.</p>
<p>APHIS currently provides a Web-based system for users to apply for permits, check the status of their permit applications, and view issued permits. The system is integrated with the U.S. Department of Treasury www.pay.gov site to process payments of any fees. Federal import permitting officials use the APHIS system workflow capabilities to review the applications and issue permits. In addition, Federal and State enforcement officials use the APHIS system to verify the validity of import permits. <br />The current system has approximately 22,000 registered users, and processes nearly 33,000 applications and issues 27,000 permits annually. The system users include APHIS import permitting officials; other Federal Government employees; State agriculture officials; and private individuals, universities, and businesses. The system exchanges data with separate systems utilized by other Federal Government agencies that are also involved in the inspection and movement of imported commodities under APHIS' regulatory authority. These other agencies include the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Internally, Plant Inspection Stations and Investigative and Enforcement Services staff use the system to validate permits and exchange data with several IT systems. In addition to the current Web-based system, APHIS has other CARPOL processes that interact with the import permitting process as well as other electronic sources of structured CARPOL data. The USDA and its cooperators issue approximately 550,000 permit-type certificates per year.</p>
<p>APHIS' primary goal is to have one flexible, expandable system that will fulfill its common data needs for CARPOL services and that optimizes user productivity, maximizes data value, and is compliant with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and directives. APHIS seeks to expand and improve its sharing, reporting, and analytical capabilities of CARPOL data and business processes. The foundation of a replacement system or service will be improved business processes identified in a business process assessment and reengineering final product produced by APHIS. An additional goal is to leverage, where possible, current technology and other resources.</p>
<p>All interested market sources are encouraged to respond with the following information:<br />&bull; Title and description of system.<br />&bull; Type of entity the system supports (Federal or State government, academic, commercial, or other).<br />&bull; Name of contractor or other entity supporting the system, including point of contact for additional information (name, address, telephone number, and email) and business status (small, large, or AbilityOne).<br />&bull; Name of customer (owner of the system or data), including point of contact (name, address, telephone number, and email).</p>
<p>Sources responding to this posting are responsible for appropriately marking any information that is proprietary in nature.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Therefore, no proposals will be accepted. No contracts will result from any submission. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received; nor will the Government reimburse participants for information provided.<br />Information requested is strictly voluntary and is for informational purposes only. Responses must be emailed to CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov and include the phrase "CARPOL Solutions" in the subject line. No telephone communication will be accepted. Sources responding to this notice will not be entitled to the results.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7420-00-NIB-0023<br />Name:		Talking Calculator, 508 Compliant, 12 Digit, Portable, Desktop, Battery Operated<br />Description:	508 compliant, 12 digit, portable, desktop talking calculator. Calculator is battery operated with earphones included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7420-00-NIB-0023<br />Similar Items:	6638EP; 221047</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 18, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 18, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		3895-00-NIB-0001<br />Name:		Tamper, Cast Iron Head, Industrial Grade, 42" Fiberglass Handle, Cushioned-Grip<br />Description:	Industrial grade cast iron tamper. This tool has a 8" W x 8" L cast iron head, weighs approximately 11.75 pounds and has a 42" yellow fiberglass handle with a cushioned- grip. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3895-00-NIB-0002<br />Name:		Asphalt Lute, Aluminum Head, Industrial Grade, 67" Fiberglass Handle, Cushion-Grip<br />Description:	Industrial grade aluminum asphalt lute. This tool has a 36' W x 4.5" L aluminum head, weighs approximately 4.87 pounds and has a 67" yellow fiberglass handle with a cushioned- grip. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		3895-00-NIB-0001<br />Similar Items:	SEY TP8</p>
<p>NSN:		3895-00-NIB-0002<br />Similar Items:	SEY AL36</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 18, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.

The MTS HPU is the most critical component in the system, as it powers all but six frames in the laboratory. MTS is the only vendor that can include extended warranty coverage for all parts and labor for repairs for the seven MTS servohydraulic frames, the MTS HPU, and four MTS controllers. The seven MTS servo-hydraulic load frames and the associated MTS HPU are by far the most maintenance-intensive and expensive-to-maintain components of the mechanical testing systems in the laboratory. As revealed by the recent attempt at full-and-open competition, other offers are not able to provide the necessary routine maintenance and repairs required of these items. Splitting out the other requirements in a separate solicitation is not in the government's best interest. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the items that would be split off impose a relatively low maintenance burden, making pay-as-you-go maintenance more advantageous than a service contract.

It also exhibits improved filterability, permitting filtration down to lower pore sizes with increased filter lifetimes, which reduces the chances of scratching by foreign particles. The reduction in slurry settling also reduces overall slurry usage, and the stabilized slurry is easier to process and easier to clean up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to notify the public of the Department of Veterans Affair's intent to enter into a Superseding Lease at its current location. Superseding Leases are used in lieu of a modification to existing leases when changes or modifications contemplated are so numerous or detailed as to cause complications or substantially change the lease.  There are no changes to the current space requirement which includes approximately 21, 831 Net Usable Square Feet (NUSF) of medical space and 152 parking spaces.  While it is not the governments intent to relocate, the VA may consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  Any offered property must be located in Superior, Wisconsin.  The Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure and security costs.  Alternate solutions must include convincing evidence that alternate space is economically advantageous.  The offered space must meet federal Government requirements for security, fire, safety, handicapped accessibility of the offered property as to the building's structural integrity; the highest safety and security of its surrounding areas.  Any expressions of interest should be directed to Christopher Vu, Contract Specialist, at 612-344-2150 no later than April 9th, 2012.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a bid and enter into a contract with Ashbury International Group, Inc., 84 BUSINESS PARK CIR, RUCKERSVILLE, VA to provide Laser Range Finder Binoculars for Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve, Gustavus, AK 99801. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND: Vector IV 7x42 Laser Range Finder binoculars to use as part of the Shipboard Observer project, quantifying interactions between humpback whales and cruise ships in Glacier Bay.  The sole distributor for this equipment, based on my research, is Ashbury International Group, Inc.  Ashbury International Group, Inc., is the sole and exclusive US distributor of the Vector binocular range finders.  They are the most powerful of the available rangefinder binoculars, they are waterproof, and accurate out to 4km which is the distance we are studying whale-ship interactions.  It is absolutely critical to have the same equipment to minimize impacts of measurement error on study quality and inferences.  			
1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Ashbury International Group, Inc., 84 BUSINESS PARK CIR, RUCKERSVILLE, VA is the sole and exclusive US distributor of the Vector binocular range finders.


2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs Vector IV 7x42 Laser Range Finder binoculars.  
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  Based on extensive research, Ashbury International Group, Inc., is the sole and exclusive US distributor of the Vector binocular range finders.
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: In order to minimize measurement errors during studies it is vital to have the same equipment and therefore Vector IV 7x42 Laser Range Finder binoculars is the only binoculars that Glacier Bay National Park can use. 

5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  .  We need these binocs because they are the most powerful and accurate of the range finder binocs and we have used an identical pair for the past five years, one pair that we purchased and one pair on loan from the National Marine Mammal Lab (NOAA).  NMML took the loaner pair back this year necessitating this purchase.  Again, it is critical that the binoculars used among observers be consistent in power and accuracy.  
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  There is no competition, there is no other supplier.

Sources Sought

The Orlando Veterans Affairs Medical Center (OVAMC) has a need to improve and simplify data management to assist with improved efficiency. OVAMC is interested in changing from a manual to an electronic document control process. OVAMC is seeking a software solution designed to streamline and consolidate document control, auditing as well as Non-conformance management, integrating with action plans, personnel and training information.  Other areas may be utilized in due course including document management in other medical center departments such as Sterile Processing Service (SPS). The electronic solution must facilitate with ease OVAMC's ability to comply with guidelines related to document control, upkeep of standard operating procedure manuals, and documentation of quality programs or competency reviews.

OVAMC seeks to mirror other VA Centers currently using a proven product. The Bay Pines Veterans Affairs Medical Center uses a standard COTS (Commercial off the Shelf) product called Proquis Enterprise (web-based intranet software solutions) as the base for the client's system requirement. The software required by OVAMC must offer: control documentation, management information, improvement plans continuous. Software must include College of American Pathology (CAP) checklist and be capable of linking and controling documents, electronic signatures, and clear change history to the checklist for documentation and inspection purposes. OVAMC seeks to reduce risk and increase the level of preparedness for audits.  Annual licenses support and maintenance, installation and configuration, and 20 user licenses will be necessary to meet OVMAC's need.

<DESC>The PMW-205 (Naval Enterprise Networks) Technical Data Research Facilities(TDRFACs) were established to provide industry offerors with equitable accessto all licensed Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) technical data developedby the incumbent in support of the existing enterprise network environment. Inorder to gain access to this corpus of intellectual property (IP) data,individual industry representatives are vetted for requisite clearancerequirements and non-disclosure agreements.  Once vetted, the TDRFACs providecleared Industry Representatives with read-only access to unclassified NMCI andgovernment developed information.  These facilities enable Industry to viewdata that is relevant to the Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) Requestfor Proposal (RFP).
Additionally, the Government understands the need to efficiently mine andanalyze NMCI Intellectual Property (IP) to further understand the currententerprise network operational environment. Keeping this need in mind, PMW-205is currently integrating a world class data mining tool into each TDRFAC.  Thetool, Vivisimo Velocity, is a leading Information Optimization platform thatprovides result-clustering, textual analysis, visualization and collaborativefeatures; such as social tagging, comments, and user ratings.  IndustryRepresentatives will be able to search through the large volume of data in theTDRFACs and refine their searches with the use of detailed metadata.  Industrycan also make comments and save favorites that can be shared with theircolleagues privately and securely within the facility.  Vivisimo Velocity isintegrated with Microsoft Active Directory, allowing for tightly controlledsecurity groups and permissions.
PMW-205 anticipates this new capability to be operational in the facilities on,or about, April 2, 2012.  For more information on the Vivisimo Velocityproduct, please visit their website:http://vivisimo.com/docs/velocity_product_brochure.pdf.

<DESC>OverviewThe Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) Program Management Office (PMO) PMW-205 hasestablished Technical Data Research Facilities that will grant Industryrepresentatives (who possess appropriate credentials) with read-only access tounclassified Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and PMW-205 producedinformation.  These facilities will enable Industry to view data that isrelevant to Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) Request for Proposal(RFP) responses.  This technical data is operational information that cannot beposted to the current MITRE Internet portal due to relevant securityconcerns.   The IP is mostly in raw form.  The Government is continuing toreceive and review the IP and has not completed review of what is being madeavailable.  The Government does not warrant any information available from theFacilities to be accurate or complete.Concept of OperationsReading Rooms within the Technical Data Research Facilities will provideIndustry with access to incumbent developed NMCI Intellectual Property (IP), aswell as Government developed Technical Data.  In order to utilize the TechnicalData Research Facility services to access the data, members of Industry must:1) possess an active SECRET Security Clearance, 2) execute a Non-DisclosureAgreement (NDA) with the PMW-205, 3) have Visitor Request (VAL) on file withthe TDR FAC Facility Security Officer (FSO) and 4) submit a Facility AccessRequest form.  Technical Data, Processes, and Procedures (TDPP) Consultantswill provide assistance to Industry Representatives, as needed, in the realm oflocating information within the data corpus and any associated questionsIndustry representatives may have.  No technical exploratory or acquisitionrelated areas of inquiry will be broached while in the Technical Data ResearchFacilities.Rules of EngagementData which is not accessible from the MITRE portal cannot leave the readingrooms.  For this reason, data cannot be printed, downloaded, or copied from theReading Rooms.  Industry Representatives will be able to take notes but willnot be permitted to bring any items into the Reading Rooms.  Representativesmay also take notes electronically using a text application on the Reading Roommachines.  TDPP Consultants will monitor the Reading Rooms for compliance andescort Industry Representatives to and from the Reading Rooms.  A TDPPConsultant will retrieve notes upon exit for inspection to ensure notes do notinclude data that cannot leave the Reading Rooms, such as Internet Protocoladdresses, schemas, ports, or any other data that would have no relevance tocontract bidding, but full relevance to malicious attacks on the NMCI network.The TDPP Consultants will retrieve and scan all notes and, upon approval forrelease, return to the Industry Representative via electronic transfer.Industry Representatives must take notes in plain English.  Any notesresembling code, or that cannot be understood, will be redacted prior torelease.Technical Data Research Facility DetailsFacilities are located in Arlington, VA and San Diego, CA. Hours of operationwill be Monday through Friday 0900-1700 respective to the locations time zone.The Technical Data Research Facilities will be closed for all FederalHolidays.  These services are available beginning on October 27, 2011 inArlington, VA and November 10, 2011 at the San Diego, CA.

<p>(2) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' and its critical subcontractors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. In addition, the offeror may submit a minimum of three (3) references for subcontractors who are expected to perform aspects of this effort that the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the SOW. Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-related; but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that described in the RFP. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions implemented to overcome problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems solved.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed questionnaires to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The questionnaires shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to Frankie.Murphy@atf.gov or faxed to (202)648-9654.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.PPIRS. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e.

Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>(3) Technical/Management Approach - The Offeror must define a technical and management approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of the SOW and its requirements. The Offeror's technical/management approach should include the following: 1) discussion of the background, objectives, and work requirements of the SOW; 2) discussion of proposed methods and techniques for completing and managing each task in a timely manner; 3) discussion which supports how each task will be managed by the Offeror's perspective; 4) discussion of any anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution; 5) discussion of major logistical considerations and; 6) The Offeror's labor mix required to conduct the tasks and produce any deliverables must be identified.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel (Project Manager, Researcher, Curriculum Developer &amp; Facilitator) - The Offeror must ensure the proposed personnel skill levels, area of expertise, education, capability, availability and experience are adequate to perform the work required by the SOW. Therefore, a resume is required.</p>
<p>- Resume shall be submitted with quotation for proposed Project Manager. Resume shall include a description of the experience and capability of proposed personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments; showing the knowledge that the individual has gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. Resume should not be longer than two (2) pages.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to eight (8) one-sided pages, excluding the resume(s), past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST EIGHT (8) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not attach any additional information as an Appendix.</p>
<p>Proposal shall be prepared in Times New Roman font, 12-point font, single line spacing, 1-inch margins, and 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. Tables, figures and graphs may use Arial, 10 point font, single-spaced.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO COST/PRICE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition. The information submitted as Volume I will be evaluated on the information presented; therefore, organization, clarity, accuracy of information, relevance, and completeness are of prime importance.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE (non rated)</p>
<p>Volume II shall consist of complete breakdown of proposed price; with files formatted in Microsoft Office. In addition to completing and returning the attached price schedule, the offeror must also provide a complete price breakdown of the quotation, which explains the development of the proposed costs (including labor categories, number of hours, corresponding fully loaded labor rates and any other direct costs). The proposed labor skill mix associated with the proposed labor rates will be analyzed to determine if the prices proposed are reasonable, for the type of work proposed. There is no page limit on price volume.</p>
<p>Pricing spreadsheets that are submitted in a very small font size and are not reasonably legible may be considered as unacceptable and grounds for exclusion from further consideration.<br />(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable (travel) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The degree to which to Offeror's experience demonstrates a thorough<br />working knowledge of successfully providing the required course design, development, <br />instruction and assessment.<br /><br />(2) Past Performance - The offerors' proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which<br />their performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements <br />similar in size, scope and complexity of this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate<br />publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past <br />performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offeror. The <br />information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination.</p>
<p><br />(3) Technical/Management Approach - The degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates a <br />knowledge, understanding, technical ability to successfully perform and manage the requirements of the SOW in an efficient and timely manner; as the proposed period of performance contained in the offeror's proposal will be evaluated for realism and achievability. Additionally, the appropriateness, soundness and reasonableness of the Offeror's problem resolution, logistic considerations, corporate commitment to achieve the overall project objectives and methodology for providing resource support will be assessed.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel - The degree to which the Offeror's proposed key personnel's (Project Manager,<br />Researcher, Curriculum Developer and Facilitator) resume demonstrates the individual's ability to<br />execute SOW requirements on the basis of strength of relevant education and training, depth and <br />breadth of relevant experience.</p>
<p>(5) Price - (non-rated) - Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b), Price analysis <br />commercial and non-commercial items.</p>
<p>Factors 1-4 are referred to as technical factors. Factors 1-4 are in descending order of relative importance (Factor 1 is more important than 2, Factor 2 is more important than 3 and Factor 3 is more important than 4). Factors 1-4 (when combined) are significantly more important than Factor 4, Price, which is not rated.</p>
<p>As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), the Government will make an assessment through a trade-off analysis and other analytic means that involve the evaluation of superior technical capability versus the added cost. Based on Best Value, award may be made to the lower priced quotation. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>Award may also be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial quotation should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Mar 2012). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via the BPN website (www.bpn.gov/orca). A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999): The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the current period of performance. (End of clause)</p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATEMENT OF WORK</span></strong></p>
<p>Functional Requirement: Two (2) separate stand-alone systems, each capable of accomplishing in automated fashion all of the tasks specified in ASTM International test procedure D 56 paragraphs 9.2 through 9.7. In particular, the instrument is capable of robotically:<br /><br />1. Increasing the temperature of the petroleum sample at each of 2 prescribed rates, 1 degree C/minute and 3 degrees C/minute.<br /><br />2. Heating the electrical ignition source prior to each introduction into the vapor space. <br /><br />3. Repetitively introducing the heated ignition source into the vapor space above the fuel at prescribed temperature intervals<br /><br />4. Recording the lowest temperature at which the air/fuel vapor mixture above the liquid sample ignites<br /><br />5. Correcting observed flash point temperature for ambient barometric pressure at the time and place of the test.<br /><br />6. Storing all test results for the day's analyses in instrument memory<br /><br />7. Cooling the liquid bath surrounding the sample cup in an accelerated way to prepare the instrument for next use.<br /><br />8. Achieving repeatability prescribed in the test method. In other words, when the same sample is analyzed twice using the robotic instrument, the 2 test results obtained will be within 1 degree C of each other for fuel samples with flash points between 38 degrees C and 60 degrees C (see ASTM procedure D 56, paragraph 14.1.1).</p>
<p>ASTM D 56-2005, paragraphs 10.1 and 12.5 effectively summarize the operations that an automated instrument must conduct.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Utilities Requirement</span>: Each instrument shall be powered by 230V, 50 Hertz electrical power and may additionally use ambient temperature water supply for bath level maintenance, bath cooling purposes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dimensions</span>: Depth of the instrument shall not exceed 22" to allow bench-top placement of the unit. Footprint of the instrument shall not exceed 350 square inches in order to conserve bench space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/D.htm">http://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/D.htm</a><br />"D56-05(2010) Standard Test Method for Flash Point by Tag Closed Cup Tester"appears near the top of the list and it is the test method which the 2automated Tag Flash Point Analyzers must be able to conduct.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;*It is highly encouraged for potential offerors to register in the CCR. Registration is free and the link is:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.asp">https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.asp</a></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Knee Supports. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA a vendor must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><strong>Points of Contact: Ms. Mary Summers, Team Lead, mary.summers1@us.army.mil 808-433-3686 or Ms. Corazon Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil 808-433-2894.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Knee Supports. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $457,594.21. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, two hundred thirteen (213) of the total two hundred thirteen (213) line items represent the top twenty-eight (28) products categories and account for 100% ($457,594.21) of the total volume in sales $457,594.21 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Mary Summers, Team Lead, mary.summers1@us.army.mil 808-433-3686 or Ms. Corazon Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil 808-433-2894.<br /></strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement.<strong> A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>

<p>Each evaluator will evaluate the same Knee Support product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fifteen (15) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. The Knee Supports will be worn by the evaluator for a 2 hour period.</p>
<p>1. Patient Comfort and Safety - NPSG 09 - Knee Supports are lightweight and the construction promotes patient comfort. The Knee Support must be lightweight to provide comfort, support, stability, and not feel so heavy that it is uncomfortable to wear. <br />2. Patient Comfort and Safety - NPSG 09 - Rigid hinge components are fully padded and covered. The rigid hinge components that are in contact with the skin must be fully covered to prevent skin injury, provide protection and comfort, and reduce potential chafing. <br />3. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 09 - Knee Supports provide stability when walking, standing or when performing range of motion exercises. The Knee Supports must provide stability during walking, standing, or during the motions of exercises in order to prevent injury to the knee.<br />4. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 09 - The adjustable straps provide easy application and stability on the Wrap Style Knee Supports. The Wrap Knee Support must be easily applied by the patient, and provide the stability required to maintain support to the affected knee. <br />5. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 14 and NPSG 07 - The fabric material is breathable and wicks moisture to control temperature inside the support. The product must have lightweight and breathable padding that will reduce moisture between the knee and device to control temperature inside the support, making it comfortable to wear, preventing skin break down, surgical site infection and/or potential pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. </strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</p>

NO HARD COPY RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED UNDER THIS REFRESH.
NOTICE CONCERNING MODIFICATIONS TO ALL CONTRACTS AWARDED UNDER THIS SOLICITATION:
GSA WILL ONLY ACCEPT MODIFICATION REQUESTS SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EMODS (http://eoffer.gsa.gov).  
The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

Notice is hereby provided that the Standing Solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule 00CORP - Consolidated Services has been refreshed.  This new solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #14 will replace solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #13, posted on July 1, 2011 and includes updated clauses and provisions.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Offerors are responsible for payment to Open Ratings, Inc. for past performance evaluation prior to submission of an offer.

The Consolidated Schedule program is an acquisition vehicle that streamlines the acquisition process.  Offers may be submitted for evaluation to obtain a single contract for multiple schedule business lines that fall within the scope of participating schedules.  Existing schedule contractors may migrate to obtain a single contract as an alternative to holding multiple (2 or more) schedule contracts.  Offers and migration requests will only be evaluated under this schedule program when the offer/migration proposes 2 or more schedule business lines.  See Part I, Section entitled Goods & Services of the solicitation for detailed information on participating schedules.
This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach to fulfilling requirements that fall within the scope of more than one schedule for acquiring a total solution. Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules. 
  
GSA is only issuing this solicitation/request for proposal through the FedBizOpps internet site, GSA will not provide paper copies of this solicitation. Interested parties may access the solicitation at Internet address http://www.FedBizOpps.gov. This site contains information describing the Federal Business Opportunities and how to register to receive automatic notices of acquisitions. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by this agency. 

For additional information regarding current contract awards review our Consolidated website at www.gsa.gov/consolidated or GSA Schedules E-Library website at http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov.
If you have further questions please contact 1-800-241-RAIN (7246) or e-mail R10MSC.Consolidated@gsa.gov.

<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and the following "best value" factors considered. (1) Past Performance - the government reserves the right to conduct their own investigation other than the contractor's provided list (2) Ability to meet the requirements and qualifications in the statement of work. (3) Response to the technical evaluation factors. <strong>THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE ATTACHED TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS. </strong>The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria.<strong> The evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</strong></p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (February 2012). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (February 2012), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p>Contractor's intending to conduct business with the Federal Government must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award. The CCR is the primary Government repository, which retains information on Government contractors. You may register via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling (888) 227-2423 or (269) 961-5757.</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br />Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 2.0 of the SOW. The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all contract line item prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.&nbsp; Proposal pricing should be presented as the contract line items are listed in this posting.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 14, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>

<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>

<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price".

The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The hauler/supplier is responsible for any and all federal and state licensing, permits and or placards that may be required to accomplish the SOW.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr Inderpreet S. Wadhwa<br />CEO, Azure Power<br />No. 8 Ground Floor, LSC Madangir<br />Pushp Vihar - 110062<br />India<br />Phone: +91-1149409800<br />Fax: +911149409807<br />Email: <a href="mailto:inderpreet@azurepower.com">inderpreet@azurepower.com</a><br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assess and provide planning assistance for two 500 kilowatt (kW) photovoltaic (PV) pilot projects in the Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. The study will not include the construction of a pilot project, but will instead assist in the assessment and planning of two pilot project sites. The analysis of these micro-grid sites will provide the necessary scale to attract equity investors for project implementation and for specialized U.S. solar exporters to establish a foothold in the growing Indian market.</p>
<p>India's increasing population and rapid economic expansion are placing a growing strain on the country's energy infrastructure. Approximately 400 million people in 80,000 to 90,000 villages do not have grid connectivity while many households in electrified villages do not have access to grid supply due to difficulties with establishing "last mile" connectivity. In light of this significant shortfall in India's existing network, off-grid electricity generation via solar power is a logical solution that would enable access to clean energy for millions of Indian citizens. Solar energy is a carbon-free alternative to current diesel generators that are the main suppliers of off-grid electricity. Given that many India locations receive an average of 1,500-2,000 sunshine hours per year, the Indian government and state governments, and many Indian and U.S. companies, have set in motion policies and plans to use this power source to help diversify the country's energy mix and contribute to environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Azure Power aims to set up over 100 micro-grid solar systems with an average system size of 500 kW covering approximately 2-3 acres of land in rural areas that currently have little or no connectivity to existing electrical grids. Through an initial pilot project of two sites, Azure plans to demonstrate the possibility of meeting rural electricity demands via a micro-grid. The main advantage of a micro-grid is that it is treated as a controlled entity within a power system and can be operated as a single aggregated load of electricity. This type of system offers easy controllability and compliance with grid regulations without hampering the reliability and security of the power utility. For electricity customers in rural areas, micro-grids are beneficial for their ability to generate electricity closer to the site of consumption, alleviate transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses, supply an uninterrupted source of power, reduce feeder losses and provide electrical voltage support.</p>
<p>The objective of the proposed FS is to optimize the design of Azure's planned micro-grid solar projects and to provide a business model that can be deployed in remote non-electrified villages throughout the country. The Contractor will provide no equipment for the feasibility study other than solar measurement equipment necessary to complete Task 5, the solar irradiation study. That equipment will be leased to the Contractor or subcontractor and will not be property of the Grantee. The specific districts of Raipur in the state of Chhattisgarh and Sabarkantha in the state of Gujarat have been chosen as suitable sites for these pilot initiatives.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $476,670 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). Azure has agreed to commit US$100,000 towards this project, which together with USTDA funding, will amount to a total project cost of US$576,670.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 Overview. This is a non-personal services contract to provide CISCO Satellite Decoder Equipment Repair and Return services. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.</p>
<p>1.2 Description of Services/Introduction. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform CISCO Satellite Decoder Equipment Repair and Return services as defined in this Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>1.3 Background. Defense Media Activity has a worldwide satellite network that delivers American television programming to active duty, government employees, and their family members stationed around the world. The equipment responsible for performing the mission periodically needs to be repaired, replaced and upgraded.</p>
<p>1.4 Objectives. The purpose of this contract is to establish an agreement with an authorized Cisco Gold Certified Partner/Cisco Authorized SP Video Partner on the repair cost for the specified models and quantities of CISCO Power-Vu satellite equipment and their subsequent shipping to the government.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE.</p>
<p>2.1 General. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) defines the requirements for the repair of integrated satellite receiver decoders (IRDs), Motion Picture Encoding Group (MPEG) encoders and multiplexers, modulators, and other hardware, software and ancillary equipment used by the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS). It establishes requirements for a contractor to provide all repair services including receipt and evaluation, selection and use of parts and material, marking, preservation, and packing for shipment. It defines the requirements for a contractor to provide telephone support to AFRTS staff and customers, and to other contractors that utilize the repairable items defined throughout this PWS.</p>
<p>2.2 Period of Performance. The period of performance shall be for one (1) Base Year of 12 months and two (2), 12-month option years. The Period of Performance reads as follows:</p>
<p>Base Year 20 April 2012 - 19 April 2013 (Est. Award Date)<br />Option Year 1 20 April 2013 - 19 April 2014<br />Option Year 2 20 April 2014 - 19 April 2015</p>
<p>2.3 Technical Exhibit 1 provides a list of equipment to be repaired under this contract. A repair versus replacement cost evaluation shall be performed prior to performance of the repair service to ensure the maximum allowable repair cost does not exceed the replacement cost for each item.</p>
<p>3.0 TASKS.</p>
<p>3.1 General Requirements.</p>
<p>3.1.1 The contractor shall perform the level of repair required to return the equipment or module to a ready for issue (RFI) condition from a non-ready for issue (NRFI) condition.</p>
<p>3.1.2 Electronic equipment shall be processed for the return of unserviceable items to an operational status. This process shall accomplish:</p>
<p>3.1.2.1 Disassembly and cleaning.</p>
<p>3.1.2.2 Repair or replacement of parts that are of marginal quality due to wear, deterioration, or damage so as to return the item to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) operational specifications.</p>
<p>3.1.2.3 Reassembly, alignment, and testing.</p>
<p>3.1.3 Authorized repair and return customers. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will review defective equipment repair requests (Reference PWS Para 6.2). The items that are approved for repair by the COR will be shipped to the contractor. The items to be repaired will come from a variety of sources including, but not limited to DMA, Television-Audio Support Activity (T-ASA), and authorized government contractors.</p>
<p>3.1.4 Obsolete parts/processes. In the event certain parts become obsolete, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and submit 1) rationale and verification of any obsolete part, and 2) a written estimate of the cost required to make the repair. The contractor shall not proceed until a firm fixed price and delivery schedule are negotiated and authorization to proceed is received from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>3.1.5 Unusually damaged items. Normal repair requirements do not include equipment or components received which indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, and severe damage due to mishandling, fire, or submersion. In the event that severely damaged or cannibalized equipment or components are received, the contractor shall notify COTR and submit 1) a description of the condition of the equipment or component as received, and 2) a written estimate of the cost required to make the repair. (See Technical Exhibit 4) The contractor shall not proceed until a firm, fixed price for repair and a delivery schedule are negotiated, and authorization to proceed is received from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>3.1.6 Limitation of Repair. The price in Technical Exhibit 1 is the cost of repair unless otherwise authorized or the Government has exceeded the maximum units in the negotiated schedule. The contractor shall notify the COR of the estimated repair cost and proceed with the repair only if authorization to proceed is received from the COR.</p>

All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. . The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 13, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov. Electronic quotes must be submitted in a format compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 or Adobe. Pricing must be sent as a separate file.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). (2) Tradeoffs are not permitted. (3) Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. (4) Exchanges may occur (see 15.306).<BR><BR>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<DESC>Additional Questions and Answers added 4 Apr 2012:
<p>QUESTION: "Obviously the backhaul bandwidth is an important factor. As there appears to be a wired infrastructure in place, there must be an internet connection for this. Can this be shared?"</p>
<p>ANSWER:*****Yes, there is bandwidth backhaul; however,<br />other users in the building will maintain current capabilities which Internet services is provided through Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), with Outreach services and the AF Military network...both<br />DoD networks. According to AF security policy, these networks cannot share infrastructure.*****</p>
<p>QUESTION:"It would make sense to talk to the provider of this bandwidth to see if there is an economical solution to share these resources."</p>
<p>ANSWER:*****Security policy will not allow sharing infrastructure.*****</p>
<p>QUESTION: "If this is not possible, do you know bandwidth providers near the base, such as Comcast or Verizon, from where a microwave link could be installed or dark fiber could be leased from?"</p>
<p>ANSWER:*****There are other providers on base: Brighthouse, AT&amp;T, Mid Atlantic Broad band (MABB), Knology, Southern Lights and Verizon Business Solutions. *****</p>
<p>QUESTION: "It appears to me, that there is a lot of Ethernet is already in the building. The wireless backhaul could be using the same PHY in a separate VLAN and the provide multiple SSID per wireless node. Would this be acceptable?"</p>
<p>ANSWER:***** No, infrastructure cannot be shared with DoD networks.*****</p>
<p>QUESTION: "If you have bandwidth on premises, how much is it? We feel that 100Mbit/s should be appropriate for the applications here. Would you agree with that?"</p>
<p>ANSWER:*****Yes, we feel that would be sufficient, but we need to make sure it is scalable.*****&nbsp;</p>

This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only offers based on approved sources under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) 1. Current approved manufacturers are EATON-AEROQUIP INC. (3E6R6) P/N EH63138-93 and SARGENT FLETCHER INC. (72429) P/N 128B5030-11. This solicitation opens on 4/18/12 and closes 5/17/12. This requirement is for a quantity of 173 each. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based on combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: Unrestricted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br /><br />ITEM DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />&nbsp; HOSE, NONMETALLIC.<br />&nbsp; 2-3/8 IN.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION: THE RESPONSE DATE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY HAS BEEN EXTENDED FROM 9 APRIL 2012 TO 16 APRIL 2012. ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS THE SAME.
_______________________________________________________________________
MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR BOMBARDIER LEARJET AND CHALLENGER AIRCRAFT 
This is a market survey for timely support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Learjet and Challenger Flight Inspection (FI) Aircraft.  Bombardier Aerospace Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), of twelve (12) FAA FI jet aircraft which includes six (6) Learjet 60, three (3) Challenger 601, one (1) Challenger 604, and two (2) Challenger 605 models.  These aircraft require a wide range of supply and technical support and services that must be provided in a timely manner.  Supply, technical support and services in support of the FAA's Learjet and Challenger aircraft includes parts, rental services, repair services, overhaul services, calibration services, engineering support services, pilot services, and technical publications.  Supply and technical support and services are necessary to maintain FAA Learjet and Challenger aircraft in airworthy, safe, and reliable condition which allows the aircraft to be readily available to perform critical FI missions.  Requirements are identified in the attached draft statement of work which was prepared by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Group (AMEG).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
Market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the supply, technical support and services necessary to maintain FAA Learjet and Challenger aircraft.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, with a size standard of $5.0 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and provide a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify in 20 pages or less:a) Type of services provided by your firm with particular attention to SOW paragraph 3.0 entitled "Supplier Responsibility". b) Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), c) Number of years in business
2.  Identify the geographical areas where your company can provide services. 
3.  Identify if your company has published pricing or online pricing available for supply and technical support and services for Learjet 60 and Challenger 601, 604, 605 aircraft models.   Identify an estimated number of supply items listed in your company published or online catalog that support Learjet 60 and Challenger 601, 604, 605 aircraft models.
4.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a DRAFT of the Statement of Work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the Statement of Work and provide comments.  If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov) the attachments may not be available/viewable to you.  If so, please proceed to the FAA's Contract Opportunities Website at faaco.faa.gov to obtain the attachments.  
All responses to this market survey must be received by 16 April, 2012, 3:00 P.M. CST.  Submittals can be by email, fax, or hard copy.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

REQUIREMENTS FOR A/E SERVICES
FOR PROJECT 586-12-202
CONDUCT SITE STUDY OF UNDERGROUND
WATER & SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE

GENERAL SCOPE:  The primary focus of the work is to provide an in-depth study of the facilitys underground water and sewer utilities to provide complete investigation and upgrade recommendations for these site utilities at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center campus, Jackson, MS.  The study will include, but not limited to, information gathering, site investigation, and system design.  The evaluation shall note any deficiencies within the systems and provide recommendations for corrections.  
The existing water service includes an 8 main loop around the facility site with several taps to feed into various the buildings.  The water loop also feeds the site fire protection system (including both fire hydrants and building fire protection systems, through post indicator valves (PIV) and fire pumps).  The existing loop is connected to the facilitys well and elevated tank system, as well as two city water main feeds (valves are currently closed to city mains, connection is for emergency backup only). [Water loop is ~4600 in length, with approximately 5 building feeds, 6 PIV fire connections (including 2 fire pump feeds), and 10 fire hydrants]
The facility sewer system is divided into separate sanitary and storm sewer systems.  The sanitary sewer ranges in size from 8 to 12, serves all the facility buildings, and connects to a single point of discharge from the site.  There is approximately 4000 of sanitary lines serving the site, connected thru approximately 27 manholes.  The storm sewer system ranges from 6 to 36 and discharges from the buildings in multiple, decentralized feeds into various collection and run-off locations.  There is approximately 8000 of storm sewer serving the site, connected thru approximately 20 manholes.   
A.	Conduct necessary site survey to identify extents and locations of the underground water and sewer systems.  In addition, perform required survey to identify all utilities, roads, sidewalks, curbs, and other features that would affect the design of replacement system components or system repair services.  
B.	Perform sewer pipe camera inspection of all exterior storm and sanitary mains.  Confirm location of manholes, clean-outs, etc.  Provide a complete report, including a video record, which identifies all damaged sections or potential problems within the system.  
C.	Provide plans and specifications for work required to repair (either by sleeving or replacement) of items identified by the above sewer system inspection.
D.	Provide plans and specifications for design of a replacement domestic water distribution loop.  New system to include, but is not limited to, new backflow preventers and meters at connections to City of Jackson mains, connections to all existing building feeds/fire service feeds, and connection to the existing well and elevated tank system.  New distribution system to be constructed with C900 piping and mechanical joint fittings (or an alternative piping system, upon VA approval).  Evaluate existing demands and potential future needs (of up to 250,000 square feet of building addition) to properly size the new loop.  
E.	All repair or replacement design shall include all road patching, sidewalk/curb/gutter replacement, and road/parking striping, as required by the installation work.
F.	Distribution loop design shall include multiple isolation valves, throughout the loop, to allow for sections of loop to be isolated for repairs, while minimizing the overall system disruption.
G.	Distribution loop design shall be modular in nature to allow for installation of sections in multiple, smaller phases, over time as allowed by future funding availability.

<ARCHDATE>06292012

<DESC>PMS 408 EOD/CREW Program Office is hosting a multi-program CLASSIFIED Open Business Industry Information Exchange Day for the Joint CREW I1B1 acquisition program (formerly JCREW 3.3), a System of System (SoS) open architecture program and Symphony Block 40, a programmable Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) vehicle-mounted Counter Radio-controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW).  Both programs provide the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED).

Both programs are managed by PMS-408 EOD/CREW. The purpose of the multi-program CLASSIFIED Open Business (OB) Industry Information Exchange Day is to increase Governments access to creative innovation while educating prospective vendors on strategies to provide new capabilities and services to our warfighters.
 This event is open to system integrators, innovators, and third party suppliers who meet the requirements to attend.

This CLASSIFIED Open Business Industry Information Exchange Day will discuss future acquisition strategies, for both programs, leveraging the benefits of open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).  Currently, PMS-408 EOD/CREW plans for a series of incremental developments, for both programs, to enable technology insertion and technology refresh.  The overall system architectures open, modular and flexible design ensures the ability to upgrade the respective product baselines for performance, affordability, availability and reliability.
  The incremental developments  will allow:  1) New capabilities and technology insertion updates cut into the existing production line to include hardware, firmware or software, into existing production line every three years, 2) Periodic technology refresh of fielded systems every six years (retrofitting - fielded systems) to maintain common baselines and to account for obsolescence while countering the rapidly evolving threat for both programs.  

Both JCREW I1B1 and Symphony programs are different but have similar technology refresh requirements.  The JCREW I1B1 System of System (SoS) is made up of:  dismounted system (man-portable), mounted system (ground vehicle and waterborne), and fixed site system (temporary geographical area and permanent).
  The Symphony,  with the ability to defeat multiple simultaneous threats, Symphony is the preferred counter-RCIED solution for Coalition and Partner Nation combat forces engaged in the Global War On Terror.  Additionally, Symphony was designed and produced specifically to protect forces of multiple nations. Symphony uses "language independent" features to supplement the instructions for installation and operation.  The antenna and installation hardware kits are tactically proven for SUVs, HMMWVs, various MRAPS, and many other commercial and tactical vehicles.
 
The Classified Industry Information Exchange Day will be on 14 JUNE 2012 and held at the CACI Enterprise Solutions Inc, 4114 Legato Rd., Fairfax, VA 22033.
  Directions to CACI Enterprise Solutions Inc. building may be provided upon registration.  Breakfast and lunch will be provided at a cost of $20.00 per person to be paid in CASH ONLY on the day of event. Space constraints make it necessary to limit attendance to two people per company. To register, please contact Sherri Patsos, at 202.781.0078, email:  JCREWIIEDay@navy.mil by 31 May 2012. The email shall include the participants full name, company they are representing, along with their titles and email addresses. ALL VISITORS are required to submit advance notice via faxed to 703.460.1854 to the attention of CACI Security Officer.  Voice Confirmation may be obtained at 703-460-1737.

These states are particularly challenged by the persistent HIV/AIDS epidemic; trade liberalization creating the need to operate in highly competitive open markets; adverse effects of a changing global climate; increased international drug trafficking and an alarming rise in youth violent crime. Added to this menu of mounting issues, the sub-region has been on the receiving end of the global recession, which has caused painful economic contraction reducing government revenues and spending, business profits, employment and personal incomes. The region's vulnerability to multiple forms of natural disasters places further stress on these fragile economies and exposes their populations to grave physical risk. </span></p>

This development assistance strategy comprises four pillars - combating HIV/AIDS, pursuing economic growth through creating economic opportunities for youth, addressing deficiencies in rule of law and juvenile justice, and assisting the region to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. This assistance is focused on the six independent states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)&nbsp;and Barbados, with additional Caribbean Regional Partnership Framework HIV/AIDS and Caribbean Basin Security Initiative activities carried out in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and in Guyana as that USAID Mission closes during 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) intends to competitively issue multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) for Active Tracking and Intrusion Detection (ATID) Services.<br /><br />A basic ordering agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the basic ordering agreement. A basic ordering agreement is not a contract.<br /><br />Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such obligation.<br /><br />Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals leading to award of orders. Issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in the solicitation. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. All Requests for Quotation (RFQ's) will first be offered to small business BOA holders. If offers are not received from at least two responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery, RFQs will then be opened up to all BOA holders. If adequate competition still cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non BOA holders.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notification of the Government's award of a sole source hybrid Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/Time and Materials (T&amp;M) Task Order (TO) in support of the U.S Air Force (USAF) Communications and Information Directorate in the 75th Air Base Wing at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (75ABW/SC), Hazardous Materials Management System Program Managment Office (HMMS PMO) utilizing the procedures of FAR Part 8, to the following incumbent contractor:
<p>IHS Global Inc<br />15 Inverness Way East<br />Englewood, CO  80112<br /> <br />This sole source TO provides the HMMS PMO continued Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste (HM/HW) Management System (HM/HWMS) support. The HM/HWMS support provided in this requirement allows Government agencies supported by HMMS PMO to remain in compliance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 372, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, Air Force Instruction 32-7086 requirements, as well as many other HAZMAT related regulations. IHS will continue to provide on-going HM/HWMS application support to Department of Defense (DOD) and Government sites and program management support to 75ABW/SC. This TO provides management, supervision, engineering services, personnel, and labor required to test, develop, train, and HM/HWMS support. The previous HM/HWMS requirement expired on 3/27/12 and the Government awarded a 3-year sole source TO that consists of one (1) 12-month Base Period and two (2) 12-month Option Periods to IHS to ensure continuity of services. It was critical that the HMMS PMO not experience a break in services to avoid costly fines, increased hazardous waste, and poor HM/HWMS support at numerous DOD and Government sites. This TO was awarded on a sole-source basis to IHS pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the HM/HW application and services at the quality required because the supplies or services required are unique or highly specialized</p>
<p>Any questions regarding the sole source TO shall be directed to the GSA FEDSIM Contracting Officer, Wesley L. Dewalt, via email, at Wesley Dewalt@gsa.gov.</p>

The federal service code for this is 7630 Newspapers and Periodicals.

?Bill Tracker - provides detailed legislative tracking tools and information
?Member Profiles - the detailed congressional member information that is used by the Office of Science
?Committee Coverage - specialized same-day coverage of all authorization committees, including hearing transcripts, markups, and news ? critical to Office of Science during budget review and hearing cycles.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
This is a NOTICE OF INTENT; however, interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency by Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at Noon, 12:00pm (Eastern) via e-mail to Danielle.Hicks@hq.doe.gov.

<AWDDATE>033012
<AWARDEE>International Resources Group Ltd. Inc, 1211 connecticut Ave, NW Sute 700
, Washington, DC 20035-2704 US
<DESC>International Resource Group was awarded the IQC Contract after holding full fair opportunity competition. After further competition between IQC holders, IRG received this Task Order and began work in September 2010. Since then IRG has hired more than a 100 staff members including international and national experts and consultants to implement Component 1 and Component 2 of the project. Till date, IRG has achieved several successes including reduction of DISCO loses by 310 million KWh at a value of $20.7 million and is aiming at a total savings of 1.541 billion kWh at a value of $193 million. IRG has also placed advisors in the Pakistan's Ministry of Water and Power and has established close network and contacts with the nine DISCOs. As a result, IRG was able to complete performance audits, finalize actions plans and seal collaboration agreements with the nine DISCOs in a timely manner. During this time, PDP has undertaken the first major demonstration of smart meter technologies in Pakistan, initiated installation of high tension capacitors across entire networks, and prepared cost of service studies.<br /><br />In addition to the PDP successes, the power sector in Pakistan is in a crisis situation. Sustained development initiatives are required to revive the sector. A new procurement would counter the sustainability of the project and would also derail the relationships established in Government Ministries, Departments and Government owned DISCOs. The proposed modification is an expansion of the activities undertaken by IRG. Pursuant to AIDAR 705.202(b), advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable because under the Expedited Acquisition Procedures this contract action is made in accordance with AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(3)(ii) regarding awards for countries for which the Administrator of USAID has made a formal written determination, with supporting findings, that compliance with full and open competition procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of the foreign assistance program.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
FAR PART 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(A) (URGENCY) 
 
2237 Transaction # 12.MN.TEDMED.A		  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.

Manufacturer/Contractor: Onstream Media Corporation GSA Contract GS-35F-0211S	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  George Stemper 877-932-3400	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 1291 SW 29th Ave. Pompano Beach, FL 33069	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: George Stemper 877-932-3400	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	Program Contracting Office East - St. Louis
		11152 South Towne Sq.           	
		
	St. Louis, MO 63025	
                                                                          VISN:	99- SAO-East	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Live Satellite downlink, encoding, Flash streaming and user support services for the 2012 TEDMED Conference held at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC during the
 timeframe April 10 -13, 2012, to all interested VHA employees/facilities external to the VAKN/CDN Firewall, per direction of the VHA Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Health. Medical Center staff(s) are encouraged to view the live broadcasts as time permits. The number of participants outside of the VAKN/CDN firewall is estimated to be approximately 10,000.	
	
	
	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Services required: Simulcast of 11 sessions (April 10 -13 - 4 days) from the TEDMED 2012 Conference Live from the Kennedy Center, Washington, DC, to be broadcast outside of the VA firewall, to all interested VA employees/facilities who do not have VAKN/CDN capabilities. The TEDMED Conference will be simulcast over VAKN/CDN, but a contract is needed to provide Bandwidth Streaming outside of the VA firewall, in addition to video downlink, webhosting, encoding and project management services during the duration of the transmissions.  Prime Contractor shall provide all technical, management, and helpdesk support for this project. Billing for streaming bandwidth usage shall be in arrears based upon actual Gigabytes (GB) used during the 4 day session by VA employees.
	
	
	
	
	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $24,900.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   April 3, 2012 (to allow time for website configuration and rehearsal/testing/tweaking before Conference begins on April 10, 2012.	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

0	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
TEDMED 2012 Live Conference sessions are proprietary to the TEDMED Consortium and the VA has been given limited rights to rebroadcast ensuring adequate security and tracking measures are in place (i.e. passwords, secure logins to view outside of the VAKN/CDN network). Onstream Media is able to provide the appropriate encoding and security monitoring; Onstream has been tasked by other Federal Health agencies to provide same or similar streaming services for this Conference.	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

1	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
Crystal City EERC was not given the requirement by the PDUSH to develop a delivery system outside of the VAKN/CDN network for the TEDMED 2012 Conference until mid February, 2012.  Research was conducted to determine what was required to be developed and in place to ensure this project could be accomplished. Market research was conducted with a number of video-streaming providers to establish and refine the requirement and the technical intricacies of providing these services.  Although there is more than one contractor who "may" be capable of providing the required services, there is no time to reflect on a "learning curve". The sensitive nature of the requirement and the technical expertise needed to deliver a quality product and to assist VA users in troubleshooting access and other issues that may present during the live webcasts, has to be done by a company who can most expeditiously identify and accomplish all of the technical and coordination tasks required. Onstream Media has worked with the VA on similar projects in the past, and is also a primary provider for live video streaming for commercial television networks. They are a GSA Schedule holder under Contract GS-35F-0211S. To compete this requirement with such a short lead-time would likely result in a failure to get the order in place in time to ensure adequate preparation and testing, and would potentially cause an actual failure in the mission required by the PDUSH. This is a requirement that the PDUSH has deemed to be an essential part of training and development for the VA medical providers, and access to the TEDMED Conference live broadcast sessions is part of the mission to train ALL VA staff. It is thus urgent and compelling to establish this order as quickly as possible in order to preclude adverse training impact to the outlying VA medical staff and innovative knowledge deficits that could negatively impact the welfare of the Veterans being treated.  






(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Price analysis between the 2 GSA schedule holders (Onstream Media and Interface Media Group - IMG) shows a price advantage on the fixed costs portion of the requirement of $2,691.00 if IMG were used. However, this price advantage disappears when the Bandwidth pricing is factored in. The Government requirements are for 10,000 concurrent streams at 500 kilobytes per second for the 26 
hours (1560 minutes) of Live Streaming Conference Sessions. IMG is offering a fixed Bandwidth charge of $0.30 per gigabyte (GB) transfer (using Akamai Technologies as the video streaming provider). Onstream, also using Akamai for the video streaming provider, is offering a Tier pricing structure that breaks down to $0.19 per GB based on up to 10,000 GB and $0.18 per GB over 10K usage. Projected actual usage is approximately 39,000 GB throughout the Conference. The price advantage for IMG disappears after 10,000 GB of use. Based upon fixed costs and Bandwidth costs,
the breakdown is as follows:  	
IMG:           $15,049 + ($0.30 x 39,000GB) = $11,700 = $26,749.00	
Onstream:   $ 17,740 + (10,000GB Tier 4 = $1,899 + $.0.18 x 29,000GB = $5,220 SUM= $7,119)
                        ($ 17,740 + $7,119) = $24,859.00	
Thus, Onstream provides the most advantageous price when the anticipated streaming usage is 
factored into the scenario. Onstream would then be able to provide more concurrent video streams throughout the Conference than would IMG for the price.	
Other factors besides price considered in this Best Value decision are as follows: IMG is providing the broadcast for the TEDMED Conference for the Consortium.  However, Onstream has a history of providing the same or similar requirements for the VA, and is familiar with the particular VA system requirements for streaming outside of the firewall. There will be less of a "learning curve" for addressing the VA-specific systems and requirements of the PWS.	
	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Both Onstream Media and Interface Media are GSA Schedule holders, and known providers of these services.  The GSA price list for Mobile Video Services, Ltd was also consulted, but their pricing was not considered competitive, especially in regards to "streaming" costs. A non-GSA provider, Ustream, was consulted for a quote. Based upon the urgency of the requirement and the short turnaround time, it is not considered feasible to compete nor to do further market research feasibility determinations on additional Schedule holders. This may be a future opportunity to advertise on E-Buy for "Sources Sought" and obtain Capabilities Statements from additional contractors who may be able to provide these services in the future.	
	
	
	
	
	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
N/A	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Recommend a "Sources Sought" announcement for GSA Schedule holders via E-buy to ascertain 
the availability and capabilities of additional providers who may be able to fulfill future like requirements. 	
	
	


(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
