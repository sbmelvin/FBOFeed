<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-99-00044-03 under which General Dynamics Government Systems Corporation (GD) provides Engineering and Construction Management Consultant (E & CMC) services to Telecom Egypt under the Telecommunications Sector Support project.   The envisioned modification will allow GD to continue to provide E&CMC level of effort services for an additional twenty-one (21) months beyond the present GD contract completion date of September 30, 2003.   GD is principally providing, or will be providing in the near future, Telecom Egypt with E&CMC services for three major Design/Build (D/B) host country contracts (HCC).  GD will also be providing advice and assistance for one USAID direct contract.  The three HHCs are for: (1) D/B of the Telecom Egypt Network Operations Center (NOC);  (2) NOC Phase II;  and,  (3) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  Under the USAID direct contract, technical assistance is being provided to Telecom Egypt for training in Network Operations Center Operations and Maintenance.  Two of the three HCC mentioned above (1 & 2) are currently facing implementation delays due to a variety of reasons (technical and non-technical) which have been deemed beyond the control of the E&CMC.

For this procurement, the U.S. government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5).  The purpose of this extension is to allow for the continuation of the E&CMC services that are presently being provided to Telecom Egypt in order to ensure the successful completion of all projects.  The E&CMC services to be provided under these projects include:

Network Operations Center (NOC).  
The E&CMC will continue to provide technical advice and assistance to TE during the two-year Advise and Assist defects liability period.  This is considered the most critical stage of the NOC project during which time the NOC is provisionally functioning and the D/B contractor is providing TE with direct on-the-job experience with the software application and functioning, plus the physical administration of the facility. 

Network Operations Center, Phase II (NOC Phase II). 
This activity will be implemented through a series of change orders to the existing D/B host country contract.  The E&CMC will prepare the necessary documentation and facilitate the negotiations between TE and the D/B contractor.  Additionally, the E&CMC will monitor all activities, handle claims and assist in arbitration as required, and perform other management services relevant to the continued implementation and completion of the project.

Network Operations Center Operations and Maintenance Training NOC Training.  This activity will be implemented through a new USAID direct contract using an Indefinite Quantity Contract procurement mechanism. Due to limited USAID/Egypt Project Office staff, the E&CMC will assist the Cognizant Technical Officer with the direct on-site monitoring of the contract.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  It is envisioned that this D/B host country contract will be awarded September 2003.  During implementation, the E&CMC will monitor all contract activities, to include, but not limited to: inspect, measure, and monitor installations, review and certify payment requests, monitor project schedule and budget, initiate and process change orders, handle claims and assist in arbitration if required.

There will be no solicitation documents issued for this proposed action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within forty-five days days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This technology has shown promising results to generate a richer feature set that  can significantly improve probability of detection and reduce false alarm rates and also offer the greater potential to penetrate the grass/leaf clutter, which is predominant in the humanitarian demining environment, than existing narrow-band vibrameters.   Under this effort, Georgia TECH will be tasked to provide technical support to CyTerra performing the following tasks: 1) Conduct a canonical data collection using existing acoustic/seismic sources with offline processing and conversion to sound alerts t o provide proof-of-principle results; 2) Conduct in-house data collection and analysis and also software development to provide real-time, on-board audio alerts; and 3) Collect test data at various government designated sites.  The integrated HSTAMIDS/Acou stic Vibration Sensor must not affect the basic HTSAMIDS parameters and performance.  It has been determined that CyTerra is the 'Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements'.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfu lly provided the required HSTAMIDS improvements may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages.  The resultant contract will be cost plus fixed price.  Responses are to be received via email wi thin 30 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to the following e-mail address: pat.davi s@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

The PA161 containers are the shipping and storage containers used for the  Modular Artillery Chagre System (MACS).  The MACS Propelling Charge, designed  and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, provides a complete zoning solution for  155mm Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic increment.  The  container was developed to protect the MACS Charges througout the Army's  stringent logistic environments and have design features that improve the  insensitive munitions characterisitics for the MACS system.  The required  delivery schedule is:  July 1, 2003, 7,000; August 1, 2003, 10,000; September  1, 2003, 10,000.  Meeting this schedule is critical to the program; a slip in  this schedule will result in a slip in the LAP schedule and downtime costs will be incurred.  A critical component of the PA161 is steel and the current lead-time is 90-120 days.  Request all information be submitted via electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil. The points of contact are Timothy Jensen,  Contracting Officer, (973)724-4196, or Margaret Rhinesmith, (973) 724-3050.   Large files need to be compressed using WinZip http://www.winzip.com.  The MACS and its components are on the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL).

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that WR-ALC anticipates issuing an engineering services task order against an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (F09603-98-G-0025) with BAE, Nashua NH  03061.  The task provides engineering services applicable to the USM-464 to resolve Obsolete Part and Vanishing Vendor (OP/VV) issues with the USM-464 in an effort to solve part availability problems.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a resolicitation of the requirements for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Contracts Office (NAVFACCO), Port Hueneme, California, has been tasked to do the study at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) for Administrative Support Services. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 50 positions by the Office of Legislative Affairs on 23 January 2001, this action will comply with procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved will include visual media support, technical librarians, technical writers, administrative support, facilities (building management), and command security. The functions being affected by this A-76 study are located in Port Hueneme, California; Crystal City, VA; and Washington, DC. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by Government personnel to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a factor equal to or greater than ten percent of the Government personnel cost. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in NFESC, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with secret information; therefore, the company and some of its personnel must have a secret clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete the required study. The expected term of the contract consists of an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months. A performance-based combination firm fixed price with indefinite quantity contract is anticipated. The majority of work will fall within the fixed price category. The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561110; size standard - $5,000,000.00.

The official planholders list will be maintained on, and may be printed from, this website.  All prospective offerors and planrooms are required to register as planholders on this website.  Hard copies (paper sets) or CD-ROMs of this solicitation or the planholders list will NOT be provided by the Government.

<DESC>BLM Invitation for Bids, NAB030026, FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA HOLDING FACILITY, FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH TWO 12-MONTH OPTIONS.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number NAB030026 applies and is issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the following requirement:  The Bureau of Land Management's Elm Creek, NE Holding Facility has a requirement for feeding services 7 days per week for 12 months, from July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004, with an option for 2 more 12-month periods.  A pre-bid tour of this facility is scheduled for February 11, 2003, starting at 10:00 a.m. local Nebraska time.  Potential bidders are encouraged to inspect the sight at this time.  The Elm Creek Wild Horse and Burro Facility is located at 5050 100th Road, Elm Creek, Nebraska.  If bidders plan to attend the Site Visit, they should contact the Facility at (308) 856-4498 prior to the visit in order to allow facility personnel time to make arrangements for the tour.  Failure of a bidder to inspect the facility shall not constitute grounds for claims or requests for equitable adjustments against the government, due to the bidder's unfamiliarity with the conditions at the job site.  Bidders shall provide a firm fixed monthly unit price for the base year, option year 1 and option year 2. REQUIREMENTS:  ITEM 0001:  The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek (EC) is the primary holding facility for wild horses and burros making there way to private homes across the United States through the Adopt-A- Horse program.  Routinely, EC receives animals from western facilities and conversely ships them to adoption locations around the midwest, southern, and eastern United States.  The facility maintains throughout the year 400-500 animals on a daily basis.  OBJECTIVE: To procure services for the feeding of these animals as they arrive from the western facilities and await transport to adoption locations around the country.  EC is a permanent year-round holding facility requiring daily feeding of the animals residing on the facility.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel and equipment to assure the daily feeding on average of 400-500 animals, 365 days per year, to include all unloading of large round bale hay shipments that arrive at EC from the hay contractor, which is expected to be about once a month. Shipments may occur more than once a month, depending on the number of animals being maintained at the facility, animal, and weather conditions.  Approximately, 195 tons of hay will be shipped per month, and shipments will include large round bales and small square bales.  CONTRATOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:  1.  As a minimum, the contractor will provide a tractor or loader with a round-bale grapple loader capable of transporting round bales to the necessary feeders on the facility.  The tractor will be required to have front assist capability because of the steep grades and slippery conditions during wet times.  Conditions at the facility can become very slippery and this requirement is necessary for the safety of the contract employees, as well as, the facility fences and ability to get hay to the animals.  2.  The contractor provided tractor will remain on the facility 7 days per week to ensure that in the case of bad weather the tractor will be available to the facility to feed horses and not need to be transported to the facility in poor weather conditions.  On occasion, with the approval of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), the tractor may leave the premises for maintenance or fueling.  OPTIONAL CONTRACTOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  1.  A pickup truck to deliver small square bales to the required feeders is optional but recommended due to the ease of driving next to the feeders and delivering the small square bales to the feeders.  2.  The facility consists of 9 large outside pens and 21 smaller pens.  The outside pens are used to house the majority of the animals and can house 50-80 animals per pen.  The outside pens have movable, large round-bale feeders.  The smaller inside pens consist of 10 pens used for animals being ready for shipment or adoption events.  Five of the smaller pens are used for BLM saddle horses or animals requiring special attention.  The smaller pens have hanging feeders requiring the use of small square bales and several have round-bale feeders that can be used.  There are also 6 isolation pens used to house sick or injured animals and have permanent feeders requiring the feeding of small square bales.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:  1.  It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel, one to operate the front-end loader tractor and one to operate the pickup on a daily basis.  Of these two, one will open and close gates.    2.  The contract personnel will be required to unload all shipments of the large round bales of hay that arrive at the facility, and to haul the large round-bales using the contractor-provided tractor/loader to the large outside pens from a central holding area.  In addition, the contractors will need to haul small square bales from a central storage area to the small pens using the contractor provided pickup truck or tractor/loader.  3.  It is anticipated that one contractor employee would drive the vehicles and the other would open gates and off-load the small square bales into the feeders.  As for the unloading of the shipments of the round bales of hay delivered by the hay contractor, it is anticipated that the contractor will need to provide a tractor operator for the contractor provided tractor.  4.  The feeding contractor, the hay contractor, and the BLM COR shall coordinate all delivery times to ensure that hay is delivered and unloaded in a timely and efficient manner.  5.  The safety and well-being of the Contractor's personnel performing these feeding services shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The behavior/conduct of the Contractor's personnel shall be the full responsibility of the Contractor.  6.  The Contractor shall be held accountable for any employee's misconduct, negligence, and/or failure to perform.  The Contractor's personnel shall have a working knowledge of feeding large numbers of animals in a feedlot environment.  7.  In the event that any one or more contractor personnel are observed performing the required duties in an unsafe manner to the animals, themselves, Government personnel, or endangering the Government Furnished equipment/supplies, the contractor shall be so notified by the COR or PI and the contractor shall provide an immediate replacement person at the facility within two hours of being notified.  8.  In as much as the facility is open to the public, the Contractor's employees will perform their duties in a manner that will not bring discredit on the BLM or the contractor.  Further, operation of equipment will take into consideration that members of the public may be in the area and utmost caution will be taken.  9.  The Contractor and personnel are responsible for any malicious damage or accidental damage of the Government furnished equipment.  On a daily basis, prior to operating any item of equipment, the contractor's personnel will perform an inspection of the vehicles/equipment to include but not be limited to fluid levels, operation of safety equipment, etc.  10.  The Contractor shall feed the animals the quantity of hay and supplemental feed necessary to satisfy the animal's nutritional needs.  The hay requirement for adult horses is 25 pounds of hay daily.  The requirement for supplemental feed, a grain mixture for foals and weanlings is approximately 2 pounds daily per weanling and 1 pound per nursing foal.  The feeding requirement for an adult burro is 12 pounds of hay daily.  11.  The objective is for all animals to attain and/or maintain a good fleshy condition.  Fleshy condition is described as: back level; ribs, not visually distinguishable; wither, rounded; shoulders and neck, blending smoothly into body.  If this objective is not being met, a change in feeding will be directed by the PI, and/or the COR.  12.  In order to assure that all animals are able to maintain a good fleshy condition, the Contractor shall space the feed in the feeders/mangers so that all the animals are afforded equal access to the feed.  In the 9 large outside pens, this will be 15 adult horses per large round bale and 20 weanlings per large round bale.  The smaller pen feeders will be fed at the direction of the Project Inspector (PI) or COR.  13.  Any feed supplements that are required by the COR will be fed in the troughs provided.  The supplemental feed bunks will be moved and fed by the contractor in a well-spaced pattern to allow animal access to the supplemental feed.  14.  In the event that the Contractor notices any animals in distress (i.e., sickly; injured; mares with foaling problems; or deceased animals; etc,), the contractor shall immediately notify a BLM representative of the problems so that appropriate action may be taken.  The Contractor shall also notify a BLM representative of any water trough malfunction.  15.  The Contractor shall feed all animals in accordance with the requirements set forth above, at least once per day, every day, to include Saturdays, Sundays, and all holidays.  Feeding shall be conducted within the hours of 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.  All duties are performed out-of-doors and subject to a wide variety of climatic conditions from below 0 degrees in the winter to over 100 degrees in the summer.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF BLM:  1.  The BLM will provide the large round bales, small square bales of hay, and the supplemental feed necessary to feed the animals on the facility.  2.  Every morning, the Contractor shall check in with the BLM PI and/or the COR for the current count of animals at the facility.  BLM representatives will also provide the following information to the Contractor: Type and amount of hay (grass hay, grass/alfalfa mix, and alfalfa hay) to go to each pen, Amount of supplemental feed to go to each pen, The identity of pens that contain animals that day and the number of animals that day in each pen.  Identify pens that horses will be moved into due to sorting.  3.  If necessary (e.g., when unexpected loads of animals arrive, when horses are sorted into different pens than where designated that morning, when animals consume more feed than was fed, etc.) the Government reserves the right to feed the animals at the facility.  Contractor shall check with the PI or COR before leaving to see if there are any changes.  This is a 100% set-aside for small business (See Note 1).  The standard SIC/NAICS classification is 8999/111940.  Size standard is $6 million.

<DESC>On December 17, 1999, the President signed legislation (P.L. 106-170) establishing the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program. Under the Program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement to contract with vendors to become employment networks (ENs), with responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services necessary to prepare and place beneficiaries in employment. The purpose of the Ticket Program is to provide disability beneficiaries more choices for receiving employment services and increase provider incentives to serve these individuals. Under the program, SSA will provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services or other support services from an EN of their choice. The Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program is being phased-in nationally (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) over a 3-year period. Implementation of the Ticket Program has been accomplished in phases.  Phase 1 began in 2001 and Tickets were distributed beginning in February 2002 in the following 13 States: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois,	Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  SSA began implementing phase 2 of the Ticket Program in 2002 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2002 in the following 20 States and the District of Columbia: Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  This solicitation extends participation in the Ticket Program to organizations serving beneficiaries in the 17 phase 3 States, as well as U.S. territories and possessions, as follows:  Alabama, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Contractors serving as ENs will be responsible for an array of duties including, but not limited to: 1) providing appropriate employment services, VR services or other support services consistent, with the successful attainment of a clients employment goal(s), either directly or by entering into contracts/agreements with other providers of such services; 2) providing the client with a comprehensive explanation of the services offered, as well as the ENs responsibilities to its clients; 3) developing jointly with the client an Individual Work Plan (IWP) that defines the clients employment goal(s) and outlines the services and supports necessary to achieve and maintain that goal; and 4) reporting data to SSA on specific client outcomes achieved through the provision of services, a statement of finances, and other management information data. Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the Statement of Work, accompanying Response Pages, and required documentation. It is anticipated that each contract will be for a five-year term, with one five-year option. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available for downloading on or about February 3, 2003 from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizops.gov. HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop a coordinated approach to defining and measuring quality of life in neurological disorders.  NINDS is attempting to identify competent sources to establish and coordinate the research activities leading to new measurement approaches.

Background

Many of the traditional clinical or functional measures of disease status, such as tests of muscle strength or counts of seizure frequency, do not adequately represent the full scope of the impact of disease on an individual with a chronic neurological disorder.  More subjective components of patients? functioning, such as social, psychological, and mental well-being, may be more important indicators of disease impact.  Measurement of patient-oriented outcomes is a particular concern in clinical trials, where small differences in clinical measurements or imaging results may not translate into important benefit to the patients.  

Some aspects of ?health-related quality of life? have been incorporated into many recent or current clinical trials in neurology, usually as secondary outcome measures.  Many measurement scales have been developed for use in various disease settings; however, some of the existing scales have questionable validity and there is no consensus on what methods should be used within or across studies or disease areas.  The lack of consensus about the best tools or approaches creates a situation where based on the existing literature, it is not possible to compare the relative burden of various neurological conditions to each other or more importantly, to compare the relative benefits of one treatment over another on the same patient-centered outcome.  An additional issue is the apparent reluctance to design trials with the primary objective of comparing quality of life, presumably because these outcomes appear to be too subjective, too hard to define concisely, too complex to administer, and too difficult to interpret.  Additionally, there is a paucity of condition-targeted quality of life surveys for persons with neurological diseases that are reliable, valid, responsive, and are brief enough to be feasibly administered in the clinical trials setting.  Supporting a research agenda that will create such a tool for persons with neurological diseases would greatly increase the probability that the research community would incorporate patient-centered measures as primary and secondary outcomes in clinical trials.  

Goals of the Contract

The overall objective of the proposed contract is to develop a psychometrically robust measurement tool that is accepted by the neurology clinical trials and clinical research community.   Specific goals of the contract are:

1.  Develop a core set of questions that will address dimensions of quality of life that are universal to patients with chronic neurological disease. 

2.  Develop supplemental questions that address additional concerns that may be specific to particular groups of patients defined by disease, age, or other factor.

It is expected that the contract will be structured in two phases.  The first phase will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of instrument(s).  The second phase addresses the formal testing and refining of the final instrument(s).   

Information Requested

Information in the following areas will aid in the design of the proposed solicitation.  We ask that interested organizations identify critical criteria to include in the solicitation.  The information supplied in response to this request need not be limited to these areas.

?	General scientific approach to identifying content and developing measures, considering the current state-of the-art in qualitative and quantitative psychometric methods;
?	Overall estimation of the number of personnel required and specific expertise needed, with approximate level of effort required for each;
?	Availability of technology;
?	Target populations (e.g., source, characteristics, numbers needed for each phase);
?	Human subjects concerns;
?	Methods of evaluation of phase I and phase II data;
?	Database/data management requirements;
?	Project timeline.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization. 

Responses should be limited to 20 pages, should be identified with NINDS RFI No. 03-007 and are due by February 24, 2003.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to:

<SUBJECT>A -- NINDS Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Facility to Execute NINDS-Sponsored Clinical Trials
<SOLNBR>NS-03-006
<RESPDATE>030303
<ARCHDATE>03182003
<CONTACT>Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email dw76q@nih.gov - Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email dw76q@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract for development of a Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Facility to assist with the efficient execution of clinical trials and other types of NINDS-sponsored clinical research.  NINDS is seeking input about the technical expertise required and available to create and operate an efficient CRC Facility, as well as input into its specific structure and design.

Background

Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in neurological treatments that require testing in randomized clinical trials to determine their efficacy and safety.  Conventional approaches to recruitment and follow-up of participants employed in recent NINDS-sponsored trials are slow and inefficient: a recruitment/follow-up infrastructure is developed de novo for individual trials, typically involving a limited number of academically-based neurologists, with recruitment lasting several years.  

The overall objective of the NINDS CRC Facility is to facilitate the efficient execution of NINDS-sponsored clinical research in order to test more treatments, more expeditiously.  Within the CRC Facility, hundreds of academic-based and practice-based neurologists will recruit and follow patients through access to multiple clinical trial protocols.  The CRC Facility will assist investigators holding NINDS grants with the execution of clinical research and with involving the broadest possible range of patients and physicians.  The CRC Facility will be a web-based network, distinctly different from traditional disease-specific investigator research networks.  The CRC Facility will serve as the switchboard to coordinate clinical research projects developed and funded by independent NINDS-supported investigators.  There will be multiple pathways to CRC Facility access, several levels of physician participation, the flexibility to adapt to the needs of specific research studies, and ongoing continuing medical education (CME) as a prominent component. 

The major aims of the CRC Facility are:

1. to expedite recruitment (achieving goals in months rather than   years).
2. to involve a wide spectrum of investigators, especially practicing physicians.      
3. to recruit a broad range of participants, particularly minorities.
4. to minimize the cost of the infrastructure, so that overall cost/participant are not increased.
5. to make participation in NINDS clinical research more accessible to patients.
6. to facilitate the transfer of research results to clinical practice, especially to  community settings.
7. to encourage large, streamlined trial designs, particularly relevant for studies of primary prevention of neurological diseases. 
8. to maintain quality by peer-review of competitive investigator-initiated studies.
9. to make study of ?small neurological diseases? economically feasible.
10. to engender a tradition of  participation in clinical research and of evidence-based therapeutics among neurologists.

These aims must be achieved while maintaining the highest ethical standards in human subject research, setting a benchmark for the entire neurology research community.

Further details about our ideas regarding the proposed CRC Facility are found in Appendix I, derived from input received at the NINDS Clinical Research Collaboration Workshop: Exploring the Options (October 7-8, 2002).  Appendix I can be obtained via email request to Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, NINDS at dw76q@nih.gov.  Proposals for alternative structures to achieve the aims above are solicited as part of this RFI.

Information Requested

Information in the areas listed below will aid in the design of a solicitation to establish and operate a CRC Facility.  We request that interested organizations identify their technical expertise and resources, and capabilities and describe their availability to conduct such an endeavor. 

1.  Design and structure of the CRC Facility

i. What are the major essential components of the CRC Facility?  What expertise, capabilities, and levels of effort are required?
ii. How can continuing medical education (CME) be effectively integrated into the CRC Facility for training and investigator motivation?  What technical, medical, and other professional expertise is required to implement the CME?
iii. What steps (or phases) are necessary for initiation of the CRC Facility?  What is the proposed timeline?
iv. Given a perceived need for more information about motivation/barriers to CRC Facility participation by practicing neurologists, academic neurologists and patients with neurological diseases, if and how should focus group data be used to this end, and what resources would be required?
v. What scientific and technical resources are required to initiate a website to efficiently link eligible patients and physicians to NINDS-sponsored clinical research projects, including assess eligibility on-line?
vi. How can access to children, women and minority participants be assured?
vii. What would be the critical mass necessary to use, operate and maintain such a facility?

2. Subcontract Award and Management

CRC Facility research may involve hundreds of investigators funded through awards issued by the contractor as subcontracts.  Describe the personnel and database requirements associated with awarding and managing multiple subcontracts, including quality control procedures and research support services.

3. Program Management and Evaluation

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-M67854-03-I-3074

<DESC>The following Request for Information is issued for the purposes of updating market research and encouraging commercial companies to provide information on individual water purifiers. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking information for potential procurement of an Individual Water Purifier (IWP) system. The lack of potable water in tactical situations may require Marines to drink from whatever sources are available, risking disease or exposure to hazardous pollutants.  The Marine Corps currently uses iodine tablets and a portable filtration system to purify water at the individual and small unit/team levels in remote locations where drinkable water cannot be supplied.  The IWP system will provide an increased capability for the individual Marine to acquire potable water from potentially hazardous water sources in a tactical field environment, thus enhancing his survivability and effectiveness in combat.  The Marine Corps? objective is to field a modular, upgradeable, man-packable system capable of removing and/or destroying contaminants of all types that Marines may encounter on the battlefield.  An evolutionary block acquisition approach is envisioned, enabling the Marine Corps to exploit advantages of near-term capability solutions, while phasing mid- and long-term solutions as technology transfer evolves.  The following ten requirements envision the end-state of the program. All the requirements are desired, but partial solutions will be sought after as a stepping-stone for the final end-state capability.
 
First, all components of the system shall be compatible with present and future NBC suits and nozzles/check valves.  The system will be compatible with all Individual Protective Equipment used by the Marine Corps.
 
Second, the disinfectant components of the system shall weigh less than six (6) ounces (dry weight) and shall not impart a strong disinfectant residual taste (i.e., chlorine, iodine, bromine, etc.) in the finished water.  This component shall be capable of treating all types of waterborne pathogens, to include: bacteria, viruses, and protozoan cysts.
 
Third, the system shall be capable of treating 300 liters of water before requiring replacement of any elements (i.e., filters) or other major components.  If batteries are required, batteries shall be commercially available and shall be included in the weight component weight limits identified above in requirement number two.
 
Fourth, the water purification system shall be modular (to include the ability to alter its configuration through the addition or deletion of components to tailor its purification capabilities as required for each Marine?s situation or field location), upgradeable (able to incorporate future technologies), lightweight, durable, easy to maintain and clean, and man-packable.
 
Fifth, the system shall be resistant to bio-film buildup or have an integral bio-film removal capability.   
 
Sixth, the system, when wet, shall be capable of sustaining freezing conditions and then maintain integrity upon thawing.
 
Seventh, for fresh-water sources (not brackish or saltwater), the system shall have a capacity of two liters and weigh less than 24 ounces (dry weight), including the water container, container bag or backpack, and purification and disinfection components.
 
Eighth, the modular system shall be easily separable.  The fresh water purification and desalination parts are not only integratable, but also an optimized ?unit? or system as opposed to two separate pieces that are stuck together.  For example, if the mission will not likely encounter brackish or seawater sources, then the desalination device shall not be required as an integral part of the rest of the system.
 
Ninth, the desalination device shall not weigh more than 24 ounces (dry weight) and shall be capable of producing one liter of purified, drinkable water in 15 minutes.
 
Tenth, the system must be capable of removing and/or destroying contaminants from all types of water (fresh, brackish, and saltwater) to military and EPA standards.  Contaminants include, but are not limited to:  silt, clay, dirt, sand, mud, waterborne pathogens (including biological warfare agents), total dissolved solids (i.e. salt), etc.  The system must remove and/or destroy most common pesticides, insecticides, and other organic materials.
 
The Marine Corps is the lead agency for acquiring the IWP system and is seeking information on available COTS solutions and other non-COTS solutions.  Firms capable of providing viable solutions are invited to submit responses to this notice to the Marine Corps Systems Command CTQ3DBR, ATTN:  Doris Ragsdale, 3041A McCawley Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134 by COB 5 March 2003.  Along with the name and description of each possible technology solution, applicable product literature, brochures, price lists, production capabilities, and training manuals involved, the Government asks that firms send the following information:  (1) the status of current USEPA certifications for Microbiological Water Purifiers for the various types of technology solutions submitted, (2) the level or status of the technologies that are awaiting approval or the passing of protocol along with their specific timeline (i.e. 3 months, 6 months) for approval, (3) affirmation of product compliance with Technical Bulletin (TB) Medical (Med) 577, the Tri Service Water Standard, as the Government desires that the carriage reservoir of the water be NBC resistant to the current JSLIST standards, (4) a list of NBC agents tested along with their 24-hour permeation rates (mg/L), (5) a list of all bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) tested along with the respective log reductions for each, and (6) the name of the laboratory(ies) where testing was performed, if not performed in-house, along with the date(s) of testing.  Additionally, capable firms are encouraged to provide three (3) test samples at no charge to be returned by MARCORSYSCOM after a 30-day evaluation period.  Firms should refer questions to the Contract Specialist, Doris Ragsdale, at (703) 432-3271 or ragsdaledb@mcsc.usmc.mil.  All information submitted by each firm will be treated as proprietary, but will be shared with Sverdrup and Battelle following receipt of a non-disclosure agreement from each of these two companies.  The Government does not intend to pay for or otherwise reimburse for information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a $150M ceiling increase to the current Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO. under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  As the design cognizant activity and builder of the in production F/A-18 E/F Aircraft, Boeing alone maintains the engineering expertise required to design, build and deliver high fidelity F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers to meet critical fleet training requirement deadlines.  The Boeing Company through their Flight Simulation division is funded by the F/A-18 E/F Aircraft Program to create aircraft systems software and modify aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) software for engineering simulations at Boeing that are used in the development of the F/A-18 E/F aircraft.  These newly created and modified OFP software models are then reused in the development of F/A-18 E/F trainer systems.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, Boeing developed and built the current F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and will be responsible for design, fabrication, integration, documentation, shipping, installation and testing of the upgrades to specific trainers.  Upgrades shall include the Block 2 configuration, which incorporates H3E requirements that will coincide with the F/A-18 E/F H3E aircraft fleet release.  As part of the Block 2 upgrades, the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar and additional functionality will be concurrently incorporated into the aircraft and trainers.  The H3E upgrade involves significant software and hardware upgrades and unknown risk areas to include high order language (HOL) development and AESA Model development.  While delivering highly complex F/A-18 E/F trainers to the Government, the Boeing Company has gained unique knowledge of the current design, the future requirements and technology aspects of the F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainer Program. Additionally, the Government has restricted and limited rights on certain noncommercial computer software and noncommercial software documentation and noncommercial technical data; therefore, the Government is unable to provide this information.  Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current aircraft design, Block 2 Configuration upgrade, and the design of the trainers, award through competition would require substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the F/A-18 E/F's mission training requirements.  To meet timeframes, milestones, and schedules, Boeing has established relationships with key personnel, and has successfully designed, fabricated, integrated, and delivered F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and demonstrated the capability to perform the required upgrades.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to George Cabaniss (george.cabaniss@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than February 24, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for the development, integration and operation of the SDO ground system. SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing our understanding of the solar process and space weather.	SDO is viewed as a follow on to the highly successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude, having an inclination of 28.5 degrees, and an orbit altitude of 21,700 miles (35000 Km).  SDO will also have a mission life of 5 years. SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high rate data (150-200 Mbps) stream.  The science and housekeeping data will be electronically distributed to the Science Operation Centers (SOCs) in real-time.	There will be a temporary data storage capability at the SDO ground station for the purpose of buffering data in cases of equipment failure or other unforeseen problems on the ground. The SDO Project is interested in procuring services for the development, integration, and operation of the SDO Ground System, located at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Maryland, with an extension at the White Sands Complex (WSC), New Mexico.	The areas included in this notice include:  Mission Operations Center (MOC), RF Compatibility Testing and Verification, Spacecraft Integration and Testing support, Flight Operations, and End-to-End Test support. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) ground data system (GDS) will consist of a dedicated pair of ground stations capable of Ka-band downlink and S-band uplink and downlink, a Data Distribution System (DDS), a Mission Operations Center (MOC) and three Science Operations Centers (SOC), one for each of the SDO instrument groups.  All science telemetry will be downlinked in the Ka-band frequency and captured at the dedicated ground stations.	The DDS, located in the vicinity of the ground stations, will distribute the science data to the respective SOC.  Spacecraft and instrument engineering telemetry will be downlinked in the S-band frequency and sent directly to the MOC, located at GSFC.  The MOC will be responsible for forwarding instrument engineering telemetry to the respective SOCs.  Instrument commands will be generated by the SOCs and forwarded to the MOC for uplink to the observatory.  The DDS is responsible for a short-term archive of science telemetry.  The MOC is responsible for the permanent engineering archive.  The SOCs are responsible for the long-term archive of the science data. The MOC is comprised of several subsystems that exchange products with the SOCs.	        The Telemetry and Command (T&C) system, also referred as the "real-time" system.  This is the MOC subsystem that supports the Observatory health and safety functions, receiving housekeeping telemetry, processing it to monitor the spacecraft status, and providing the command generation capabilities.    The Mission Planning System ingests operating plans (i.e.normal operations or maneuvers) and generates corresponding timelines and commanding sequences. 	   Unique to this mission's operations and integration will be the inclusion of a remote control interface to both the ground station(s) and the data distribution center located outside of GSFC and the GSFC institutional system.   	 The Trending System: this subsystem is also primarily used by the FOT to trend and analyze selected telemetry parameters.  Reports may also be provided to the SOCs, if desired.       The Flight Dynamics System (FDS).	This subsystem provides several attitude and orbit data products to the SOCs. The Data Distribution System (DDS), located in the Data Distribution Center (DDC) at the antenna site, in WSC, NM.	This system provides the interface for science telemetry, distributing the data to each SOC using a high speed network to Stanford, CA, University of Colorado, and Naval Research Lab, in Washington, D.C.  The DDS will support retransmission of data if line outages occur. The SDO Ka/S-band antennas will be located at WSC to support continuous downlink of science and spacecraft housekeeping data.  The proposed antennas will support near continuous operations for the life of the SDO mission. SDO plans to use a combined Flight Operations/Integration and Test Team to Maximize the reuse of personnel between the development and operations phases.	Integration and Test activities will start during component development and will include:  development of test scripts and procedures, development of display pages, assist in development of the command and telemetry database, provide recommendations back to government engineers on viability of tests, and support launch preparations.  Operations activities will also start during the development phase, with the FOT participation in health and safety monitoring of the observatory, operations support to maintain mission orbit, command management, analyze telemetry on daily basis, and ensure that anomalous conditions are resolved.  The FOT will consist of highly experienced engineers capable of operating, testing and maintaining Observatory and its subsystems. The RF Compatibility Testing may require the contractor to travel between GSFC and WSC, NM. The entire system requires acceptance testing, end-to-end testing and certification of ground system components in preparation for an August 2007 launch data.   Many key positions on the MOC, Antenna, and Data Distribution Center development teams may require, at a minimum, a Secret Clearance. The Integration and Operations RFI covers does not cover the implementation of the Antenna Facility and Data Distribution System. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. However, there are some questions that need to be answered in order for SDO to proceed with this procurement: 1)    Are there companies that have access to resources or services that provide a complete Development, Integration and Operations service?  2)	  Does your company have access to commercial network providers for high speed data distribution (i.e. 150Mbps  200Mbps) 3)      Are there concerns in operating/managing a large development effort such as this and what may be a strategy to implementing the SDO ground system. (Explain) 4) Will a strategy address some of the operational reliability, robustness and allow for flexibility for growth and evolution; and can you describe how your company may incorporate NASA furnished systems into your strategy.  (Explain) 5)	  Will a strategy address how you would automate the MOC for lights out operation or how you would leverage NASA systems to assist you in developing a lights out environment. (Explain) Sources with information relevant to this request are asked to respond by submitting a white paper of no more than twelve (12) pages which address the above questions.  Comments and questions regarding this solicitation are always encouraged and solicited.  The SDO Project encourages responses from industry that have expertise in space flight systems integration.  The responses should demonstrate the technical feasibility, operability, reliability, and simplicity of their services.	The information received in response to this announcement will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of government and industry experts.  Some or part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation.

<SUBJECT>--ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES TO RAISE THE DOLLAR THRESHOLD AND COMBINE CONTRACT PERIODS DACA31-98-D-0052
<DESC>NA The Government intends to raise the dollar threshold and combine contract periods under contract DACA31-98-D-0052.  The contract is an Indefinite Delivery-Type contract advertised in the CBD 1/21/98 for Indefinite Delivery-Type (Multidiscipline)Contract, A JCC Site R PA, Ft. Detrick, MD but may be used throughout the Baltimore District.  The contract was awarded to NUTEC Design Associates, Inc. September 11, 1998 for one base period of $750,000.00 and two option periods of $750,000.00.  As a result of the Us er requesting additional work be performed in areas requiring high-level security clearances and explicit and unique knowledge of the ongoing research and testing at Ft. Detricks microbiological laboratory, this additional work will require increase of th e contract value of over $2,250,000.00, but under $2,750,000.00. NUTEC Design Associates, Inc. has been performing the work and has the credentials for the continuation of the ongoing effort.  NUTEC has the required training to work within bio-hazardous la bs and has completed several designs. NUTECs level of knowledge of the existing facility and their level of clearance in the area of concern is expressly unique, as is the nature of the work being performed. Therefore, the Baltimore District is intending to issue a modification to the contract to increase the contract values from $2,250,000.00 to $2,750,000.00 and combine the periods into one period for $2,750,000.00.  This is not a request for proposal.
