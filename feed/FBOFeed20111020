For more information on PESS, please visit the Internet site for theNASA/ARC Business Opportunities page athttp://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21.This bridge contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite-DeliveryIndefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. This bridge contract is necessary in order toensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technicaland programmatic impacts to ARC and is necessary since contract NNA08AF30B has reachedthe maximum IDIQ value. The anticipated award date is December 1, 2011. Ames Research Center is responsible for planning and managing requirements that supportNASA projects and projects.  The contractor provides support services in all aspects ofmission and instrument development and implementation for components, subsystems,systems, observatories, ground support equipment, spacecraft, and suborbital craft (e.g.,aircraft, sounding rockets, UAVs, balloons), including payloads, free-flying spacecraft,suborbital craft payloads, and Space Station payloads as well as ground supportequipment, non-flight models, and prototypes; candidate, feasibility, and systemsdefinition studies; project management; systems engineering; analysis; preliminarydesign; detailed design; design trade-offs; parts and material selection; manufacturingprocesses; non-flight fabrication; assembly; integration; test and verification; testinstrumentation; data systems management; launch and post-launch operations; research andtechnology unique to system development; documentation; maintenance; sustainingengineering; configuration management; mission assurance; and risk assessment. Currently, ARTS is providing critical engineering support for the following project:LADEE (Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer):  LADEE is planned to launch in May2013.  Currently, Ames has more than 7 task orders with ARTS for work on LADEE and over20 design engineers, test engineers and fabricators are critical support to the LADEEteam.  Below are examples of critical task orders which need to continue that have beenawarded to ARTS 	Under task orders titled, LADEE Thermal Engineering, LADEE UVS System,Guidance, Navigation and Control, and LADEE Flight Structures, ARTS supports thedesign, development, fabrication, integration and test of the LADEE spacecraft system. ARTS is involved in the thermal design, the structural design, the design and fabricationof the wiring harness, the design of the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls system andits 3 Degree of Freedom Testbed, design and fabrication of the ground support hardwareand software, as well as the subsystem and system level integration and testing.  ARTSknowledge and experience with the LADEE specific systems is critical to successfulintegration and testing.  Integration and testing on the structure will start in December2011 and continues to May 2012.  Integration of the science instruments, including theUltraViolet Spectrometer (UVS), will start in June 2012.  Observatory Testing will beginin August 2012 and run through October 2012.  For the integration and test to besuccessful, ARTS knowledge and experience is critical.  	Under the task order titled, LADEE Engineering Support, ARTS is building theMechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE) for Integration and Testing which needs to becompleted before December 2012.  For LADEE to meet its schedule and budget guidelines, itis important that ARTS continue to support the MSGE as the spacecraft undergoesintegration since it designed and developed the MSGE.	Under other task orders such as the LADEE UVS EEL, ARTS is responsible fortesting the spacecraft, the UVS and the observatory.  ARTS test engineers have years ofexperience operating the test equipment located at Ames.  ARTS is currently refining testrequirements and processes with the LADEE team. An interruption or delay of the support to the LADEE project, with a new contractor for alimited time until the PESS contract is awarded, would greatly jeopardize the success ofNASA's ARC implementation of critical and highly visible Agency programs.

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. In 2007, Congress enacted the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), which in part, directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a program which provides consumers with information on the rolling resistance of vehicle tires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, Section 111. of the Act states that the Secretary shall "... promulgate rules establishing a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program for replacement tires designed for use on motor vehicles to educate consumers about the effect of tires on automobile fuel efficiency, safety, and durability."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Requirements of the program include:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"...a national tire fuel efficiency rating system for motor vehicle replacement tires to assist consumers in making more educated tire purchasing decisions..." and "...specifications for test methods for manufacturers to use in assessing and rating tires to avoid variation among test equipment and manufacturers..."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In accordance with these requirements, NHTSA published a final rule adopting international standard ISO 28580:2009(E) as the test procedure to be used in obtaining tire efficiency (or rolling resistance) ratings for passenger car replacement tires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The measurement of rolling resistance requires precise instrumentation, calibration, test conditions, and test equipment for repeatable results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although these requirements can be met, NHTSA research has shown that a great variation in test results can occur between test laboratories and test equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To address these variations and to ensure that test equipment used by various tire manufactures are aligned to a single test machine (i.e., test measurement results from different test laboratories can each be aligned to the single, aforementioned alignment lab's reference machine using the ISO 28580 process so that data from these different laboratories can all be compared to each other) ISO 28580 requires the establishment of a reference laboratory and a reference (or alignment) test machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the awarded contract (anticipated to include a two-year base and three one-year option periods) DOT will identify the contractor as the single reference laboratory against which all tire efficiency (rolling resistance) equipment for passenger care replacement tires shall be aligned in accordance with the ISO 28580 process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All costs associated with the establishment and operation of this Alignment Laboratory shall be borne by the contractor and financed through fees it charges to its customers (both private industry and, on occasion, the federal government) for providing these alignment services. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Alignment service fees shall be proposed (on a firm-fixed price basis) by the contractor for the two-year base and each of the three option years and, upon conclusion of negotiations between the government and contractor if necessary, shall be included as part of the resultant contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contractor will also be required to provide the government with periodic reports which will provide contract status, describe alignment work performed, and provide data generated by testing under this contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs associated with the preparation and submission of these reports will be reimbursed by the government at firm fixed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>prices established in the awarded contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), has a requirement to enhance the capacity of foreign clinical sites to design, conduct and manage clinical research projects.</p>
<p>Description<br /><br />As part of NIAID's mission to advance the global health agenda, DMID supports a spectrum of international clinical research involving sites in resource-limited countries and focusing on those infectious diseases which disproportionately affect the populations residing in those countries. As of 2009, DMID-supported research in international settings included nearly 650 projects, more than of half of which involve human subjects. The work is distributed in 74 countries, 55 of which are resource-limited, through grants and contracts to foreign institutions, grants to U.S. institutions conducting international clinical research, and through multiple research groups.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the DMID international infectious disease research agenda involves enhancing the capacity of foreign sites to design, conduct and manage clinical and non-clinical research projects, including compliance with regulatory requirements and established guidelines and standards for the conduct of human subjects research. In order to enhance clinical research capabilities at international clinical sites, DMID awarded a contract in FY2005, under the title "International Clinical Sciences Support," to provide training and assistance to such clinical sites with respect to various aspects of clinical research. The contract awarded under this solicitation will continue this effort.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded. The Government's requirement for the work set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) of this solicitation is estimated at 9360 labor hours per contract year based upon the assumption of 4.5 FTE's with a FTE being defined as 2080 hours. This requirement will consist of one (1) base period of one (1) year and six (6) one (1) year option periods. The labor hours are inclusive of vacation, sick, and holiday time. <br /><br />In addition to the Base requirements sited above, during each contract year the Government may exercise options up to 5 (five) times a year for additional level of effort by up to (0.3) FTE's (624 labor hours) in Principal Investigator/Project Manager, Professional, Technical support to respond to emerging needs related to the proposed research.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about November 1, 2011 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Bldg. 200 AHU and Motor Control Center Replacement

Project # 662-12-004


General Intention:

A.	Contractor shall furnish all labor and materials needed to perform all demolition, renovation, replacement, installation, finishes and commissioning required by this scope located at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center as required by specifications.

B.	Visits to the site by bidders may be made only by appointment with the Contracting Officer for the project.  

C.	This project is to take no longer than 360 calendar days from notice to proceed.  This project will be phased and temporary electrical feeds will be necessary, the contractor shall reflect this in his proposal.

D.	The contractor will dispose of all equipment components demolished or replaced as part of this project.  
  
E.	Contractor shall be responsible for providing temporary electrical feeds to electrical motors as necessary for replacement of each Motor Control Center.   Also the contractor will be obligated to reroute all conduit and feeds as necessary to complete the installation as shown on attached diagrams.  

F.	The contractor shall include all necessary name plates for each device and provide the arc flash rating for each piece of new equipment.  The contractor shall show the report which includes the calculations to determine the arc flash rating for each piece of new equipment.  Arc flash protection similar to the Eaton Motor Control Center models is preferred.  

G.	Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Where ever referenced, assumes Toshiba Q9 or equivalent equipment to be installed.

H.	Each Motor Control Centers shall have gateway monitoring system similar to the Eaton system.  It shall be able to allow trending and monitoring of each device in the Motor Control Center.  This system shall be networked to allow remote monitoring from the network.  Each device in the Motor Control Center shall have a LCD screen to show electrical values of the device, current, volts per phase, etc.  

All Motor Starts shall have LED indication lights for status: run, off, failure. 

J.	The contractor shall provide the adequate amount of spaces per the table per each MCC.  The contractor is to provide the correct size Motor Start, VFD, or adjustable breaker as required by the table.  All spaces in each Motor Control Center will be filled with one of the choices above.  Adjustable breakers will be 0-100 amp adjustable trip.

K.	The contractor shall be responsible for tying in all Motor Starters shown on the load schedules.  All existing Motor Starts at the equipment shall be bypassed and removed from the equipment.  This will insure all Motor Starters will be energized from the Motor Control Center Cabinets.
 

MCC-D:
Replacement of MCC-D will require a new feeder to be installed from the basement of Bldg.200, from MS-2 panel board to the penthouse location.  Recently a similar electrical feed was installed from EMS-B on the exterior of the building to the penthouse, approximate linear run was 200 Feet.  The VA would like a similar installation for this new feed for MCC-D. This project will include a painting of the exterior conduit with marine paint type application.  This new feed will connect to the new MCC-D in its new location, see drawing A.  This feed will be 600 kcmil size wires, 3 wires in the conduit.  The contractor will need to install the appropriate conduit size and pull boxes required for this installation.  The contractor will also provide the wire and labor necessary to install the wire rating necessary for the project.  The VA is specifying Eaton Motor Control Center equipment due to its Arch Flash safety device features which will make this installation very simple.  Without completing a large shutdown, the VA would like to have both MCC-D, new and old activated at the same time to allow a faster switch over of each load independently allowing only small shutdowns for each device.  The contractor shall have the new MCC-D 100% installed and ready for load transfer.  The contractor shall prepare and install all re-routing conduits and junction boxes before the first shutdown is scheduled.  Once the entire load of MCC-D has been transferred and connected to the new MCC-D, old MCC-D shall be demolished and removed.  New MCC-D has a load schedule below showing each planned transferred load and spares located which will be filled with an adjustable breaker. New MCC-D rating is minimum 400 Amps, 480/277.       

MCC-E and X:
Once MCC-D has been replaced, its original location will be used for the new MCC-E and new MCC-X location.  Each MCC has a load schedule below showing existing load, and spare locations which shall have an adjustable breaker installed.  There are three emergency feeds that feed existing MCC-E and MCC-X, a 100 amp, 200 amp, and 400 amp feed.  See one line diagrams attached to reference the feeds.  When both MCC are completely installed, MCC-E will be fed by a 400 amp feed, that it is fed from now.  MCC-X will have a 200 feed which exists but not yet activated.  The 200 amp feed is not connected, but coiled up inside the MCC-E.  The 100 amp feed will be abandoned and leads will be removed from the breaker in panel EMS-B.  The 200 amp feed leads will need to be landed on an existing 200 amp breaker located in panel EMS-B.  The equipment on both of these MCCs must have short shut down times either for load transfer or temporary feeds.  MCC-E shall be a minimum of 400 Amp 480/277 V.  MCC-X shall be a minimum rating of 200 Amps 480/277 V.

MCC-F:
MCC-F will be replaced and the new MCC-F will be placed in the same location.  The existing loads on MCC-F will be temporarily fed from the new MCC-D during replacement.  The existing feed for MCC-F is a bus tie off the existing MCC-D.  When new MCC-F is completely installed, it will be fed from the existing feed of MCC-D, as new MCC-D will have a new feed installed during the project.  MCC-F has a load schedule below, showing existing loads and spares that will be installed for the new MCC-F.  MCC-F minimum rating is 400 Amps, 480/277.  With the replacement of MCC-F, a new door will be cut into the existing louver section of the North side of the penthouse, near MCC-F location.  This door should be 4' wide minimum, with appropriate lockset shown in specification section 010000. This will allow the contractor to access the penthouse for easier delivery of these electrical items.

<p>Background:<br /><br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that provides evidence-based information about health care outcomes, quality, cost, use, and access. In addition, AHRQ is committed to writing, editing, and designing publications and other tools and materials that help AHRQ's key target audiences understand how to put research findings and related products into practice. Equally important, AHRQ supports initiatives that disseminate and help move research into practice. As a result, health care decisionmakers (including consumers) are able to make informed decisions that improve the quality of health care services.</p>
<p>The Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) manages and coordinates the Agency's knowledge transfer, marketing, media, and publishing projects. OCKT is the organizational unit of AHRQ that is responsible for ensuring that information about Agency products and sponsored research is available to a wide array of target audiences and is actually implemented in the health care system.</p>
<p>AHRQ organizes and prioritizes research, products, and tools supported by the Agency into six Portfolios of work. These six portfolios (Patient -Centered Health Research, Prevention and Care Management, Value, Health Information Technology, Patient Safety and Innovation/Emerging Issues) have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and disseminated. <br /><br />AHRQ's Knowledge Transfer Program is intended to accelerate the dissemination and implementation of AHRQ's evidence-based products, tools, and research findings into the health care system. Some of the strategies and tactics used to reach target audiences and to encourage use and implementation of tools and products, include ongoing outreach to organizations and individuals through health communications and social marketing; partnership development; learning networks; educational outreach; individual and/or group technical assistance; events such as Web conferences, teleconferences, in-person meetings, conferences, forums, or symposia.</p>

<DESC>1. The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron, LGCU is soliciting interest and capability statement for a competitive acquisition for providing Air Advisor Academy training in support of the Air Advisor Pre-Deployment Program, Randolph AFB, TX. Air Advisor training will support approximately 900 and may increase to 1500 expeditionary students annually. The Air Advisor Academy is an evolving program. Requirements identified in the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) may require modification as the program progresses. Changes may include adjustment of training hours, mutually agreed upon acceleration of the workload estimates, changes to the syllabus, and other modifications as necessary to ensure an effective Air Advisor Program.
<p>2. The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and assist small businesses, in general, in obtaining contracts and subcontracts. This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP); but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing a future RFP. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. . Acknowledgment of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this RFI, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the RFI (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).</p>
<p>3. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this RFI is 611699, size standard $5M. All respondents are requested to identify their business size and type of business for NAICS 611699. "Small business" means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business. If business size is transitioning to other than "small business" in the next 90 days, please indicate as such. Prospective vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>4. During the performance period, the place of performance would start at McGuire AFB, New Jersey but might transition to another location upon the availability of alternate Government Facilities. The Air Advisor training course would be required to be conducted in approximately 21 training days. This course would provide just-in-time pre-deployment ground centric training for USAF, DoD, or Department of State personnel in advance weapons handling, combat lifesaver, enhanced force protection, improvised explosive device (IED) awareness, high threat driving, language, cultural awareness, counterinsurgency, and other critical ground training. Training would be student centered with hands-on scenarios and practical exercises.</p>
<p>5. A draft PWS has been posted along with this sources sought synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments. The PWS is still a work-in-progress, and this is NOT the final version.</p>
<p>6. It is the Government's intent to award one contract. The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns. (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.) Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).</p>
<p>7. All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:</p>
<p>A. Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.</p>

<DESC>B-1B Training System (TS) Sources Sought Notice<br />Solicitation Number: FA8621-12-R-6254 20 October 2011
<p>I. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES<br />This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br />The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide Contract Logistics Support (CLS) and Training System Support Center (TSSC) services for the B-1B. The existing B-1B TS services contract ends in December 2011 and a follow-on B-1B TS contract is currently in source selection. The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with an extension of the current contract up to six months from 01 January 2012 -30 June 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.<br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the FAR. Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<br />Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />II. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS<br />The B-1B TS consists of an Aircrew Simulator System (ATS) component, Maintenance Training System (MTS) and Egress Trainers, which support initial, continuation, and re-qualification training of B-1B aircrews and maintainers. The ATS consists of five Weapon Systems Trainers (WST), two Mission Trainers (MT), and five Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPT). The MTS consists of nine Simulated Maintenance Training Systems (SMTS), eight Avionics/Armament Maintenance Training Systems (A/AMTS), and a Primary/Secondary Flight Control Maintenance Trainer (P/SFCMT). The trainers are located at Dyess AFB, Texas; Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota; and Sheppard AFB, Texas.<br />Sustainment of the B-1B TS is essential to providing continued training capability. High rates of availability are necessary to meet the training needs of operational aircrews. The TS must be updated, whenever necessary and possible, to account for diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and obsolescence. The B-1B TS must provide an operational capability at the unit level enabling the WSTs to fully participate in Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training. Full DMO capability will be required at Dyess AFB and Ellsworth AFB, and a limited capability will be required at the contractor's development facility. Finally, quality CLS, TSSC, and depot functions at the Main Operating Bases (MOB) must be provided to ensure continued TS availability.<br />There are 35 devices as follows:<br />Device Number Location Location<br />Weapon System Trainer 5 Dyess AFB (2)<br />Ellsworth AFB (2) Incumbent's Facility (1)<br />Mission Trainer 2 Dyess AFB (1) Incumbent's Facility (1)<br />Cockpit Procedures Trainer 5 Dyess AFB (4) Incumbent's Facility (1)<br />Armament/Avionics Maintenance Training System 8 Dyess AFB (2)<br />Ellsworth AFB (2)<br />Sheppard AFB (3) Incumbent's Facility (1)<br />Simulated Maintenance Training System 9 Dyess AFB (3)<br />Ellsworth AFB (3)<br />Sheppard AFB (2) Incumbent's Facility (1)<br />Primary/Secondary Flight Control Simulated Maintenance Trainer 1 Ellsworth AFB (1) <br />Egress 2 Dyess AFB (1)<br />Ellsworth AFB (1) <br />Armament System Trainer 3 Dyess AFB (1) <br />Total Devices 35 <br />The contractor will only be responsible for supporting the devices located at Dyess AFB, Ellsworth AFB and Sheppard AFB.<br />CLS/TSSC Services Anticipated. The contractor will be required to perform CLS of the B-1B ATS, MTS, and Egress Trainers. This includes generation, management, and updating of new and existing training system publications; engineering drawings; technical publications; hardware, software, and firmware documentation (product baseline); spares; and support equipment.<br />Distributed Mission Operations. For DMO, the B-1B WSTs and MTs will connect into the DMO Network (DMON) through a portal provided by Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability Standards. The contractor will be responsible for ensuring the WSTs are compliant with the current versions of the CAF DMO System Standards to achieve interoperability in the developed DMO Federations.<br />Security Requirements. The Contractor will be required to have a secure facility. Personnel performing tasks for the B-1B TS will require access to information contained in technical data, films, specifications, and/or related equipment having security classifications up to and including SECRET/NOFORN data.<br />Contract Specifications. It is anticipated that this effort for the B-1B TS will commence on 1 January 2012 and possibility of going until 30 June 2012 to allow for the follow-on B-1B TS contract to be awarded. <br />The B-1B TS will remain at Ellsworth, Dyess, and Sheppard Air Force Bases, where it will be operated and maintained under contractor support.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein.
<p>This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 31 each "F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the F-15. The F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies are considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the brake system. Brake systems are designed to let the heat out a certain way so that things cool quickly without causing some of the surrounding components (brake housing, wheels, etc.) to get too hot which would result in a failure. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the heats shield it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. That is why it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Honeywell International Inc's own expense. Since the data required manufacturing the F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies are limited to Honeywell International Inc, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the entire F-15 wheel and brake package at their own expense.. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.</p>
<p>Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - A/E SOLICITATION #5198</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of California, which operates and manages the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is in-process of selecting a second UC LBNL campus with the potential for approximately 2 million gross square feet (GSF) of research and development facilities. The new campus would consolidate up to approximately 480,000 GSF of leased laboratory and office space and up to approximately 70,000 GSF of operations space in the first phase of development. Existing programs in leased facilities include Genomics, Life Sciences, and Physical Biosciences. The balance of the development capacity would allow for additional consolidation, growth of existing programs, new initiatives, and co-location with UC Berkeley, other UC programs, and synergistic third-party R&amp;D organizations<br />LBNL will create Long Range Development Plan, Physical Design Framework, and Basis of Design documents for the 2nd Campus. These documents will represent LBNL's programmatic vision, planned campus environment, land use designations, infrastructure requirements, technical standards and specifications, and specific requirements for the 1st phase of development.<br /><br />Through this A/E Solicitation #5198 LBNL intends to subcontract for Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services as an owner's representative that will review and verify that the scope and detail of the LBNL architectural and technical, as well as building code, requirements have been incorporated into the design and construction by the 2nd Campus development team.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice (SS) for the continuation of Leasing and maintaining the Toshiba Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of ALL qualified sources to perform this requirement.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible business' under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees. All eligible business' responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of order a letter from the manufacture must state that your company is authorized to provide the requested item.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures. This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery. The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions. Computed Tomography is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body. The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods. The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients. This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium. One disadvantage of current generation MDCT scanners is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors. Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body. To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts. This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.</p>
<p><br />Purpose:</p>
<p>NHLBI is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this effort. At a minimum, prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas:<br />1. Competence and experience in the operation and maintenance of 256-row MDCT Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner<br />Provide certification in order to lease a Toshiba 256-row MDCT Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner</p>
<p>Anticipated period of Performance: December 30, 2011 through October 29, 2012, for period not to exceed 10 months.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes:<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>Purpose of the Announcement: This is a Sources Sought notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of organizations. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The National Children's Study, National Institutes of Health seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources for the completion of an Information Management System.
<p>Background/Objectives <br />The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (the NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) serves as the lead agency for the National Children's Study (NCS or the Study), a longitudinal cohort study to examine the effects of the environment, broadly defined to include the biological, chemical, physical and psychosocial-cultural environments, as they interact with genetic potential to impact growth, development, and health of children across the United States. Participants will be followed from before birth to age 21 years. The goal of the Study is to improve the health and well-being of children by contributing to understanding the influence of multiple factors, both negative and mitigating, on health and disease. As the research progresses, findings from the Study will be made available to researchers and to the public to facilitate further study and to guide health practice and policy. Additional background about the Study is available on the Study Website (www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov).</p>
<p>Required Capabilities for Provision of NCS Information Management Systems <br />The National Children's Study requires an Information Management System (IMS) that is based on the principles of modular, interoperable, non-proprietary architecture using international data acquisition and transmission standards. This approach will help ensure that the system can adapt to an ever evolving environment, maintain maximal compatibility with other systems, and be readily learned and adopted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall implement, operate, manage, maintain and update, as necessary, an integrated IMS that complies with NCS standards and requirements, incorporates the functionality needed to perform data acquisition, case management, quality control and interface with the centrally-based components of the overall NCS IMS needed for management of the Study.</p>
<p>The NCS Program Office provides a set of Master Data Element Specifications (MDES). The data acquisition process flow is that field data, including operational data elements, are acquired and stored locally and then transmitted securely on a fixed scheduled to a central data repository. Local storage allows for preliminary error checking and quality control compliant with the NCS MDES and process flow prior to data transmission to the central data repository.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only. No contract or cooperative agreement will be awarded from this announcement.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest is conducting market research to determine the interests and capabilities of entities that possess potential sites for upcoming compensatory mitigation requirements for impacts to aquatic resources in the Puget Sound area.  This program will establish a list of candidate sites which support compensatory mitigation using permittee responsible mitigation either via preservation of high-value aquatic habitat through a conservation easement for permanent protection of the site or restoration of the site to increase the sites existing function(s) and value(s).
  A combination of preservation, enhancement, and restoration may also be used at the site. Compensatory mitigation may be required for both fresh-water riparian wetlands and nearshore aquatic/marine habitat.  The candidate mitigation sites must be owned in fee simple or have options to purchase by the respondents at the time of the response and must demonstrate the ability to obtain all required entitlement for execution of the restoration within one year.  Additionally, respondents need to have the expertise, experience, or business partnerships in place with organizations who can demonstrate knowledge, expertise, and a proven performance record for long-term monitoring, maintenance, and adaptive management of these mitigation sites to fulfill compensatory mitigation requirements as specified in a Mitigation Action Plan for the site.
  Preference will be given to candidate sites and responses which demonstrate existing habitat value and capacity at the time of response. The current estimate is to provide compensatory mitigation for the loss of 0-10 acres of Nearshore aquatic resources.  The amount of mitigation required will depend on the functions and values of habitat and resources at the candidate sites and the proposed mechanism of mitigation (preservation, enhancement, restoration, etc.). The candidate mitigation site(s) must be able to comply with all requirements of Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources; Final Rule (USACE, 2008). Requirements may include compensatory mitigation in the Hood Canal Watershed.

The proposed permittee responsible mitigation program will be established to improve existing aquatic resources, repair a damaged existing aquatic system or naturalize an area that was once an aquatic system, create a brand new aquatic resource system where one never existed, or protect an existing aquatic resource permanently through an appropriate real estate or other legal instrument.

The proposed program will address watershed needs and how locations and types of compensatory mitigation projects address those needs.
 The final determination of compensatory mitigation requirement will be based on the attributes of the Navys impacted site, its type, size, function, and regional characteristics, and the type, size, function, and regional characteristics of the selected mitigation sites.  

Other items for consideration include, but are not limited to: landscape scale, historic and potential aquatic resource conditions, and terrestrial connections between aquatic resources.

Entities interested in participating in this program or having any of the above qualifications should submit a statement of qualifications describing potential sites, capabilities to perform long-term maintenance, adaptive management, and permitting, or experience with wetlands mitigation or restoration projects.
 Please also include any direct experience in or knowledge of compensatory mitigation vehicles and/or mitigation bank projects. Please ensure the statement of qualifications includes the following:

1. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) currently with Real Property Interest, availability to perform conservation on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

2. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) currently with Real Property Interest, availability to perform restoration on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

3. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) with current Real Estate options, availability to perform conservation on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

4.
 Quantity of Habitat (in acres) with current Real Estate options, availability to perform restoration on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

5. Past experience performing long-term maintenance and adaptive management of  restoration sites.

6. Past experience performing long-term maintenance of conservation sites.

The statement of qualifications should not exceed 10 pages. If the entity does not currently have existing restoration or conservation sites, please state when the entity expects to have real property interest in those sites.  Additionally, if a business relationship is required to provide the prospective sites long-term maintenance and adaptive management, submit a statement of when and with whom those relationships will be formalized.
  

This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, contract award, or cooperative agreement nor will it reimburse the respondent any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.

All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes. Interested sources must submit their statement of qualifications via e-mail to Ian Robinson, Contract Specialist, NAVFAC NW, e-mail ian.robinson1@navy.mil, phone (360) 396-1865. Responses must be received no later than 21 November 2011.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR CONTENT MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES

RFI closes 1500 PM Eastern Standard Time, November 7, 2011.

Confidentiality
All information included in this Request for Information is confidential and only for the recipients knowledge.  No information included in this document or in discussion connected to it may be disclosed to any other party outside the Government.

Introduction and purpose of this RFI

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will take procurement action in this matter.  Furthermore, the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

This RFI is to conduct market research to help VA refine its Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) for Content Management Support Services for VA Learning University (VALU), Learning Content Management System (LCMS) and Talent Management System (TMS).

The refined PBWS will be included in any resultant Request for Quote to be release within Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 to solicit for the Content Management Support Services for LCMS and TMS.  

Background

As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Human Capital Investment Plan (HCIP), VA has recently undertaken an ambitious transformation effort designed to improve service to our Nations Veterans, including a commitment to invest in employees at all levels of the employee life cycle.  Employee development is a primary target of many of the transformation initiatives.  As a foundation for these initiatives, a supporting technological infrastructure is necessary.  VALU has implemented the basic learning infrastructure and will be expanding it to meet the needs of the VA.  

In October 2007, VA implemented an enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) to support employee development efforts at the national level.  Up until that point the offering, delivery, and tracking of learning was primarily managed at the facility level. Disparate systems were either built or purchased locally, and resources were dedicated locally, to manage the efforts.  Currently there is no centralized reporting capability, standard content development or implementation procedures. With the acquisition of an enterprise-wide LMS, VA positioned itself to provide employees and staff with a single tool to support their development and meet the VAs reporting requirements.

The LMS transitioned May 23, 2011 to the VA TMS, which provides all the capabilities previously available in the LMS but has added set of performance management features enabling VA to implement an effective talent management strategy.  The VA TMS has nearly 400,000 users and as of June 2010, the ability to offer local catalogs of content was made available to all VA facilities and offices.  At the start of FY10, roughly 10,000 courses with online content were offered via the VA LMS, over 25,000 programs in all.  Since deploying the VA LMS, the system has recorded more than 10,000,000 training completions from VA employees and staff.  In FY11, VA anticipates the number of users to grow to 500,000 and to double the content offerings as facilities grow more comfortable with the system.

VA implemented the VA TMS through an Interagency Agreement between VA and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The VA TMS is an enterprise-level software application designed to plan, deliver, and manage all learning events across the VA.  It is a web-based application that serves as the single point of access for all training activities for VA employees and staff. The VA TMS is a Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) learning management system created by Plateau Systems, Ltd. The existing VA production version is 6.3.3.  

The VA has acquired the LCMS to provide education and learning developers with the capability to: a) create content-centric learning strategies that can support multiple methods for gathering and organizing content, b) leverage content for multiple purposes, and c) operationalize content for mission critical purposes.

An important role in supporting use of the TMS is providing feedback to stakeholders so they know exactly what to expect and from where any issues or problems may arise. Additionally, the VALU Learning Management Office works with users to develop and deploy functional, effective learning in the TMS.  More specifically, the VALU Learning Management Office is accountable for the conformance of e-learning content available on the TMS to various VA and regulatory policies and standards, despite the fact that they do not build the content themselves.

Statement of Need

The VALU Directorate for Learning Infrastructure is responsible for the configuration and reliability of VALU learning infrastructure systems that support VA-wide education, leadership development, learning, and training, as well as the content delivered from the systems and the quality of the data recorded therein.

The Directorates responsibilities include: 

	troubleshooting VALUs systems, processes and content; 
	uploading new courses to the TMS, managing existing courses, monitoring outdated courses; 
	generating course completion reports and data reports reflecting  the success of current initiatives and the quality of TMS systems; 
	reviewing, prioritizing, and recommending for implementation ad hoc requests for system modifications, and providing the resources necessary to support the operations and management of the LCMS, TMS, and other support services provided by the VALU Directorate for Learning Infrastructure.

The Contractor shall provide management support to facilitate the development, user acceptance testing, and deployment of VALU learning infrastructure systems (including the LCMS and TMS).  Those systems support the creation, delivery, and management of VA-wide education, training, and learning. Support includes troubleshooting any errors in the system, providing feedback to stakeholders, verifying the quality of the TMS system, and drafting communications messages intended for VA learning infrastructure users.  Managing customer expectations is an important element to the support.  The focus of this RFI is on achieving the following results:

1.	Developing and implementing an e-Learning plan to ensure all e-learning content available via the VA TMS is 508 compliant
2.	Developing, deploying, and managing the VA Learning Content Management System and provide content management support (refer 5.1.3).

Sources Sought

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Office of Health Information
BOPS 12-40 VHA Section 508 Office Training Program


1.	INTRODUCTION:
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Health Information (OHI).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.


2.	BACKGROUND:
The VHA Section 508 Office's primary mission is to test e-learning courses for Section 508 compliance before they are placed on the TMS.  The 508 program has yielded impressive gains in operational efficiency and compliance performance over the last 20 months.  These gains, however, are constrained by the lack of Section 508 knowledge and experience among the dynamically changing workforce.  There is still much to be done to continue this trend, and the key is to increase training in this very complex and often misunderstood field of accessibility and Section 508. Such Section 508 training initiatives requires expansion of program resources to create a designated training branch.  


3.	OBJECTIVES:
The Office of 508 Compliance, within the VHA Office of Health Information (OHI) is seeking for services to develop, implement, and maintain a VHA 508 Office training program for members of the workforce that have key roles in the procurement, management, development, and dissemination of accessible products and services.

Ability to gather relevant material and seamlessly integrate that information into the existing courses will be required.  In-depth understanding of the provisions of section 508, advanced technical expertise in identifying and explaining Section 508 violation and advanced technical expertise in providing detailed, step-by-step solutions to these violations will be required.  In-depth knowledge of the use of a variety of screen readers, screen magnification software products, voice input software and any other assistive technologies which are identified as necessary to thoroughly address Section 508-related violations and to provide step-by-step solutions will be required. The ability to create accessible Flash and knowledge of  the ability to create accessible documents using Adobe Professional, Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 (particularly, but not limited to, PowerPoint, Word and Excel) are essential.  

The Section 508 standards established by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) are incorporated into and made part of all VA contracts, solicitations and purchase orders developed to procure Electronic and Information Technology (EIT).  These standards are found in their entirety at http://www.section508.gov  A printed copy of the standards will be supplied upon request.

<CONTACT>Stephen M. Colton, Phone 702-652-6005, Email Stephen.Colton@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: Creech AFB Wastewater Collection System Privatization
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Governments intends to enter into a utility service contract with the Clark County Water Reclamation District (CCWRD). During the life of this contract CCWRD will assume ownership of the Creech AFB wastewater collection system. CCWRD will furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil no later than 05 November 2011; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The Clark County Water Reclamation District (CCWRD) is the only interested and responsible entity capable of fulfilling the Government's requirement. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to convey utility systems to non-Government entities. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) in March 2008. The RFP was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website. No responses were received. After the closing date of this solicitation, CCWRD showed interest in this requirement. Because no other sources showed interest, 10 U.S.C. 2688 authorizes the Government to conduct a&nbsp;sole source procurement with any single entity that is interested and capable of fulfilling the requirement. Further, FAR 6.302-1(b)(3) specifically states that "when acquiring utility services, circumstances may dictate that only one supplier can furnish this service". Historical and current market research reveals that CCWRD is the local provider of this utility service and the only authorized entity within 5 miles of Creech AFB capable of fulfilling this requirement.</p>

<DESC><p>This synopsis provides for a non-personal services contract to augment the Government by providing CV-22 aircraft maintenance support. It is anticipated to be a Competitive 8(a) acquisition approved by SBA with Requirement Number 0491/12/200137. This acquisition is planned to consist of a base period of 12-months and 4 option periods. Additionally, it is anticipated there will be a few Optional CLINs that may or may not be executed pending Government need, approvals and/or funding. These options will be detailed in the solicitation. Estimated posting of the DRAFT Solicitation is approximately 7 November 2011 and it will have Solicitation number FA0021-12-R-0001. The estimated periods of performance are as follows:</p>
<p>Base Period: 1 April 2011 - 31 March 2012<br />Option Period 1: 1 April 2012 - 31 March 2013<br />Option Period 2: 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014<br />Option Period 3: 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015<br />Option Period 4: 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016</p>
<p>CV-22 Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) services are required to support Hurlburt Field, Florida, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, Cannon AFB, New Mexico, and RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom with potential for a future base in the PACOM. The CV-22 aircraft have the primary missions of combat and training missions driving both CONUS and O-CONUS support requirements. The CV-22 is a weapons system that currently has limited organic maintenance capability. Because of organic maintenance capability, complexity of the aircraft, and programmed growth, the maintenance concept is a combined effort of active-duty Air Force and Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) technicians. Both active-duty Air Force and CMS technicians are responsible for Organizational level (O-level) and Intermediate level (I-level) maintenance. The CV-22 aircraft located at Hurlburt Field, FL, Cannon AFB, NM, and RAF Mildenhall, UK, and potential for a future base in the PACOM AOR are operational assets that will be deployed overseas to conduct and support AFSOC operations. CMS personnel assigned at those locations will be required to deploy or perform temporary duty world-wide in support of CV-22 mission requirements. The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations. The requirement is a mix of Mechanical Specialty Maintainers and Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainers in sufficient numbers in the applicable functional areas to manage, supervise, and perform all tasks required by the PWS. The CV-22 program will continue to mature from a current 20 aircraft to an end-state of 50 aircraft through 2016. Final aircraft basing is not yet determined. The increase in aircraft may drive a requirement for additional growth in CMS personnel to conduct aircraft maintenance and on-the-job training at each location. The specific personnel requirements include:</p>
<p>Program Manager (PM): The PM is required to have a minimum of 18 years experience in aircraft maintenance and working knowledge of flightline operations/supervision. Although not required, the Government desires an Airframe and Power Plant certification for this position as well as V-22 specific experience. This position will be located at Hurlburt Field, FL.</p>
<p>Site POC: The POC at each location is required to have 15 years experience in aircraft maintenance and flightline operations/supervision. The Government desires this position to have three (3) years of V-22 experience, however, one year of documented recent (within the past three years) experience on the V-22 is required. The POCs shall be fully qualified in their primary specialty Mechanical (APG) and/or Electrical/Avionics Specialty in order to be available to perform aircraft maintenance daily. Although not required, the Government highly desires an Airframe and Power Plant certification for this position.</p>
<p>Mechanical Specialty Maintainer: Personnel must have a minimum of 7 years continuous aircraft maintenance background/experience in an Aircraft Mechanical specialty on any fixed-wing or rotary aircraft. Furthermore, it is the Government's desire to attain personnel with three (3) years of V-22 experience, however, one year of documented recent (within the past three years) experience on the V-22 is required. Overall intent of the Mechanical Specialty Maintainer is to have the primary background/qualifications equivalent to the Air Force "APG" mechanic with secondary skill sets of Engines, Hydraulics, and Fuels specialties. This requires the skill set of maintaining and managing all aspects of aircraft maintenance. The Contractor shall submit Mechanical candidates who possess the knowledge, experience and equivalent certifications of a 7-level Air Force APG mechanic and are at least 80 percent qualified/proficient on the Mechanical Specialty tasks. Candidates/employees shall become fully qualified in the secondary skill sets within a reasonable and realistic period.</p>
<p>Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainer: Personnel must have a minimum of 7 years continuous aircraft maintenance background/experience in an Aircraft Electrical/Avionics specialty on any fixed-wing or rotary aircraft. Furthermore, it is the Government's desire to attain personnel with three (3) years of V-22 experience, however, one year of documented recent (within the past three years) experience on the V-22 is required. Overall intent of the Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainer is to have the primary background/qualifications equivalent to either of the aircraft Electrical/Environmental or Aircraft Avionics specialties, but ultimately shall be qualified in both skill sets identified. The Contractor shall submit candidates who possess the knowledge, experience and equivalent certifications of a 7-level Air Force Electrical/Avionics Technician and are at least 80 percent qualified/proficient on either the Electrical/Environmental or Avionics Specialty tasks. Candidates/employees shall become fully qualified in the secondary skill sets within a reasonable and realistic period</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii) and FAR13.501(a)(2)(ii), the U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC), Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to:   <br><br>Harris Corporation<br>1680 University Ave<br>Rochester, NY  14610-1839<br>	<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br>No solicitation document is available. <br><br> <br>1.   Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>Item			Qty			<br>KDU Mount Assy	          4			<br>Cable Assy, 25Ft	 46		<br>Adaptor Unit PA		  8		<br>									<br><br>2.    A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to  <br>provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Acquisition of the aforementioned highly specialized communication equipment in item 1 from Harris Corporation without competition is justified because Harris Corporation is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the equipment.  The items are required to meet the Program Manager - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) critical communication network and infrastructure utilized to facilitate war planning and rapid information dissemination to depots, as well as, OEF and OIF theaters of operations.  The Harris Corporation communication equipment is the only of its kind that has been qualified through testing, and are compatible with UAS platform technology configuration performance requirements necessary to insure consistent connectivity with UAS drone platforms.<br><br><br>3.    A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a <br>statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br>	<br>Market research was conducted by reviewing Department of Defense (DoD) Emall, DoD Suppliers List, Defense Logistics Agency and GSA Advantage data bases.  No communication equipment other than the communication equipment identified under item 1 can meet the Program Manager - UAS needs; considering price, certifications, reliability, compatibility with configuration, and proven critical mission performance requirements in theaters of operations.<br><br><br>4.    Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   <br><br>The Government does not own the technical data rights to Harris Corporations' nomenclature/part numbers nor does it intend to purchase the data rights.  Therefore, no acquisition data is available to provide a technical data package, specifications, engineering descriptions or statements of work suitable for full and open competition.<br><br><br>5.   A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or <br>services required: <br><br>Notices required by FAR 5.201 shall be published and any bids and proposals received shall be considered.<br><br><br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Yvette.m.daltorio.ctr@us.army.mil no later than 3:00 PM on 27 October, 2011.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>Army Contracting Command (ACC) <br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact: <br>Yvette M.

<DESC>The goal of the Phoenix program is to develop and demonstrate technologies to cooperatively harvest and re-use valuable components from retired, nonworking satellites in GEO and demonstrate the ability to create new space systems at greatly reduced cost. Phoenix will demonstrate around-the-clock, globally persistent communications capability to US warfighters more economically, by robotically removing and re-using GEO-based space apertures and antennas from de-commissioned satellites in the graveyard or disposal orbit. Phoenix will prove the technical capability to re-use a non-operational but functional aperture on a cooperating retired GEO satellite. <br />To achieve this goal, the Phoenix program envisions developing a new class of small "satlets", or nano satellites, which can be sent to the GEO-region more economically as a "ride along" on a commercial satellite launch, and then robotically attached to the antenna of a non-functional cooperating satellite, essentially creating a new space system leveraging the System F6 architecture. A payload orbital delivery system, or PODS, will also be designed to safely house the Satlets for transport aboard a commercial satellite launch. A separate on-orbit "tender," or satellite servicing satellite is also expected to be built and launched into GEO. Once the tender arrives on orbit, the PODS would then be released from its ride-along host and link up with the tender to become part of the satellite servicing station's "tool belt." The tender plans to be equipped with grasping mechanical arms for removing the satlets and components from the PODs using unique space tools to be developed in the program.<br />

<DESC>In order to stay aligned with its mission to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Louisiana Recovery Office (LRO) is hosting a Disaster Contracting Industry Day. The purpose of the Industry Day is to inform local businesses about future requirements and to gain industry insight regarding best practices and standards to assist with requirements development. <br />Since each disaster is unique and brings new challenges and opportunities, the types of requirements needed to support the mission vary. The following is a sample list of requirements that may be needed based upon historical data:<br />&bull; Purchase of temporary housing units (THU)<br />&bull; Hauling and installation of THUs<br />&bull; Maintenance of THUs<br />&bull; Deactivation of THUs<br />&bull; Site preparation<br />&bull; Portable toilets<br />&bull; Base camps<br />&bull; Light towers<br />&bull; Grounds maintenance <br />&bull; Forklift rentals<br />&bull; Archeological studies <br />&bull; Temporary staffing services<br />&bull; Advertisement services<br />&bull; Janitorial services<br />&bull; Debris Removal<br />&bull; Food Service<br />&bull; Laundry Service<br />&bull; Hotel Contracts<br />&bull; Transportation Services
<p>Key personnel will be on hand to explain FEMA's role during a disaster and to answer questions. Additionally, in order to support and further foster successful business participation, presentations on how to respond to notices for federal opportunities and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will be given.<br />Companies are asked to register by Friday, October 21, 2011. The first 40 registered companies wanting to present their capabilities to FEMA personnel in one-on-one breakout sessions will be allowed five (5) minutes to present. <br />The Industry Day event is free and open to all interested businesses, although Louisiana businesses are especially encouraged to attend since requirements resulting in contracts or blanket purchase agreements will be awarded to businesses residing or primarily doing business in the state of Louisiana.<br />The event will be held on Friday, October 28, 2011 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Dillard University, Professional Schools Building, Georges Auditorium, 2601 Gentilly Boulevard, New Orleans, LA 70122. Those planning to attend should submit the attached registration form to Ashly.J.Banks@dhs.gov and Anthony.Collins@dhs.gov. <br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.

<DESC>Over the last few years with the cancellation of the Constellation Program, therehas been a shift in how the International Space Station (ISS) Program transfers crew andcargo to the ISS.  The ISS Program will now expand its use of Commercial andInternational Partners to provide for crew and cargo services.	This change in Programfocus has a direct impact on the how NASA manages the ISS Program and its relatedtransportation and integration services.   Based on all these changes, the ISS Programneeds to be able to address and respond more quickly to the dynamic environment of launchschedule changes. A new contract strategy has therefore been developed that combinesportions of the Mission and Integration Contract (MIC) (NNJ10GA20B) and the ProgramIntegration Contract (PIC) (NNJ09GA18B) which will be the Mission and Program Integration(MAPI) contract and provides for a separate standalone Russian Language and Logistics(RLLS) contract.

<SOLNBR>

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>Intent to Sole Source
NAICS Code: 334516 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, intends to issue a sole source task order to LECO Corporation under their GSA Schedule contract for purchase of a Pegasus 4D GCxGC/time-of-flight mass spectrometer system. 
Scope and Capabilities: The objective is to obtain a state-of-the-art Pegasus 4D GCxGC/TOF-MS gas chromatograph/time-of-flight mass spectrometer system to replace the out-dated system currently in the laboratory. This system is needed to provide sensitive and specific detection of non-traditional analytes in a variety of samples. The instrument includes ChromaTOF 4D software, electron impact (EI) ionization source, mass range of 5 to 1000u, unit mass resolution across the mass range, acquisition rates of 1 to 500 spectra per second, differentially pumped system allowing carrier gas flows up to 10mL/minute, Agilent 7890N GC with split/splitless injector, liquid nitrogen cooled GCxGC thermal modulator, full qualitative and quantitative data processing capabilities, PC and two 19? flat panel color monitors, remote diagnostic service, and NIST library search program and database (CD format).
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. LECO Corporation is the only vendor providing this instrument. The LECO Pegasus 4D is the only time-of-flight mass spectrometer designed to be a GCxGC instrument, which allows for more complete complex sample analysis. The high GC flow rates the system can accommodate are unique, and allow for fast GC analyses, which are required in the second stage of the GCxGC. Fast GC requires using higher flow rates to speed up the analysis. Typical flow rates for GC/MS analyses are in the range of 1-2 mL/minute. The Pegasus 4D can accommodate GC flows up to 10mL/minute. Fast GC also requires fast mass spectral data acquisition rates to give an adequate number of mass spectra across a GC peak to provide for good quantitative performance (more spectra provide more accurate peak integrations). The time of flight mass spectrometer provides acquisition rates up to 500 complete mass spectra per second, more than necessary to provide accurate p eak integrations. LECO also has integrated state-of-the-art data processing and display of GCxGC data into their software.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Task Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 5 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring Maryland, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price award to American Chemical Society for the renewal of a SCIFINDER Subscription. This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Scifinder Scholar database is the only database on the market currently that completely meets WRAIRs requirements. WRAIR chemists require access to an externally hosted, web-based, comprehensive chemical database. This database must have an intuitive search interface, have the ability to perform faceted searching, and be able to IP authenticate. This interface must be Section 508 Compliant because FAR regulations require this. It must only use session cookies because government privacy regulations prohibit the use of persistent cookies. It must be OpenURL compliant so that the WRAER. electronic journals can link from the search results with a single click. This product must have data including chemical reactions, chemical structures, bibliographic data, analytical data, patents and molecular sequences. This product will be used in support of the antimalarial, antileishmania and chem/biodefense programs. This product must have access to the CAS registry database, as CAS registry numbers represent specific chemical structures, and are used by chemists when referring to a specific structure of a compound. CAS registry numbers must come as part of a subscription from CAS. While they appear occasionally in the public domain, they are licensed and should be only used by a valid license holder. As such, American Chemical Society is the only responsible source that possesses the services required to meet the Government's requirement. Point of contact for this requirement is Ms. Monica Pileggi at monica.pileggi@us.army.mil. <br><br>Mr. Jeff Sprecher will issue the solicitation on/about 31 October 2011 on behalf of Ms. Pileggi while she is on leave. Quotes will be due 17 November 2011 to Ms. Pileggi via email.  <br>

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for custom high-performance long-wave and mid-waveinfrared interference filters. These filters are needed for existing research-gradeinfrared cameras that are equipped with spinning filter wheels for multi-spectralimaging. The mid-wave filters are needed for a camera that operates in the 1.5 to 6micron band, and the long-wave filters are needed for a camera that operates in the 6 to12 micron band. Each filter wheel spins at rates up to 200 Hz and has 8 filter positions.When all filter positions are filled with filters, small variations in filter weight,from filter to filter, can cause significant vibration of the filter wheel and cameraassembly. To maintain balance and prevent these vibrations, we require that the filtersof each respective band all be made using the same substrate and fall within a closeweight tolerance. We also require high performance with maximum possible averagetransmission, 90% or greater, and steepest possible slope, 2% or smaller. Delivery isrequired 8 weeks after award of contract. Please see attached for the complete Statementof Work.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport intends to award a sole source contract to Systems Engineering Associates Corporation (SEACorp)62 Johnny Cake Hill Road, Middletown RI 02842, for the operational maintenance and technical engineering services in support of the acquisition and life cycle maintenance of the Ohio Class Submarine CCS/NPES DPS shipboard/non-shipboard system and subsystem and related elements.  The operational maintenance tasks will encompass operational Ohio Class submarines and shore sites performing training, refit, and maintenance activities extending from preventative and emergency maintenance to equipment refurbishment to laboratory layout planning and implementation.
  The technical engineering tasks will also encompass operational Ohio Class submarines and consist of: design concepts and engineering proposals, development, integration and installation, test and evaluation plans, test data results, future alteration planning, validation and verification, and conduct of various analysis and studies of engineering requirements, for hardware and software. 

This task order is also for the procurement of hardware/firmware engineering and life cycle support, and material and services for the refurbishment, installation, checkout, life cycle maintenance and repair of the Ohio Class Submarine Data Processing Subsystem (DPS) TRIDENT Signal Data Converter (TSDC) CV-3325B(V)/UYK equipment and related systems.
   The Fleets required response and repair time for resolution of high priority problems shall be 24 hours or less.

An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee provisions is anticipated.  The period of performance shall be three years from date of award.  The sole source determination is based on the experience, skill set required for timely installation, maintenance, and repair of the Ohio Equipment Replacement TSDC rests solely with SEACorp and their employees. In addition, the Ohio Submarine Class program is the only program using the OER TSDC thereby further limiting available expertise, which SEACorp possesses, for maintaining these now unique, obsolete components.

EG-PSDS centers on establishing "enabling environment" needed to promote FtF as well as the broader private sector stakeholders affiliated with or supporting agriculture sector development under GTP. The EG-PSDS seeks to promote the development of both public and private sector actors in the target reform areas of Finance, Trade, Business Capacity, and the "Cross Cutting" area of ICT. To this end, USAID/Ethiopia intends to award a five-year $19 million contract for the implementation of Trade and Customs Enhancement Reform Project (TraCER) through a competitive full and open request for proposal<br />The goal of the Trade and Customs Enhancement Reform Project (TraCER) is to improve the trade environment in Ethiopia, resulting in expanded exports and a more competitive private sector as key drivers of sustainable economic growth and reduced poverty in Ethiopia. The TraCER project is structured to achieve a number of defined activities and results yet allowing for additional activities that will be pursued depending upon windows of opportunity. <br />Trade and Customs Enhancement Reform will a) Create a trade center that links academia, the private sector, and the public sector; b) Facilitate the streamlining of customs processes; c) Introducing ICT platforms to support customs processes; d) Develop the capacity of a core team of GOE staff to participate in trade negotiations; e) Educate the private sector on international standards and best practices; f) Elevate the profile of Ethiopian products in international markets; and g) Establish a framework for the promotion of trade corridors with neighboring countries.<br />TraCER project is expected to reach its goal through the following three separate but complementary, interrelated objectives: <br />&bull; Objective 1: Improve the overall trade environment by reducing the cost and time of exporting/importing goods.<br />&bull; Objective 2: Assist the GoE in completing the process of acceding to the WTO. <br />&bull; Objective 3: Enhance quality of public-private dialogue.<br />In addition, each of these objectives will have a public outreach element whereby sustainable consultative methods will be developed/enhanced to communicate any important changes in trade regulations or tariffs to the private sector and the public.<br />

<DESC>Description:
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the New U.S. Courthouse in San Diego, Ca.</p>
<p>This project provides for the construction of a new courthouse in downtown San Diego, CA. The site/design and construction prospectus will be designed to meet the amended 30-year requirements of the U.S. District Courts and related agencies with the initial build-out to house the 10-year housing requirements.</p>
<p>The design is a culmination of collaboration that took place between the San Diego Community, the U.S. Courts, Centre City Development Corporation and GSA.</p>
<p>The site for the new United States Federal Courthouse in San Diego offers an extraordinary opportunity to develop an architecture that contributes to the downtown business core, the city's exceptional climate, unique history, and it responds to the vital urban fabric of the adjacent residential communities.</p>
<p>In addition to a new courthouse, the project master plan integrates new and existing federal buildings with gardens, plazas, a water feature and pedestrian paths that engage and support the downtown urban design goals. To achieve this balance of program requirements and civic amenities, the entire 100,000 square foot site has been creatively utilized. Below-grade support and service areas fill the entire site, while the plaza level footprint is a modest 20,000 square feet. This planning strategy has allowed the design team to develop the heart of the site as a significant new public plaza that will be an active center of the federal building complex and an important new civic space for the city.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. The art budget for the New U.S. Courthouse, San Diego, Ca project is currently estimated to be $200,000.00. One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry). The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the New U.S. Courthouse in San Diego, California, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM California Time on Friday November 25, 2011. Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry. Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline. If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at 202.501.4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project. GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer Richard Meier &amp; Partners, Los Angeles, Ca for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Relevant Attachments:Model contract: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ11379879R/Model-Contract.pdf    Historical data of travelers/trips: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ11379879R/Historical_Data_of_travelers_and_trips.xls  One-on-One Communications Questions and Answers:http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ11379879R/One_on_one_communications_Question_and_Answers.doc	I. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for International Emergencyand other Relief Services for NASA travelers with minimum requirements as follows: The offeror shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish International Emergencyand Other Relief Services for NASA travelers, including Evacuation and RepatriationServices to a hospital in the United States (U.S.) with attending medical teams, medicalequipment, and use of western equivalent services in country to stabilize patients forevacuation.  The contractor is responsible for providing the medical assistance necessaryto receive required medical attention and/or definitive care including medicalevacuations, when necessary. Other required services include assistance with obtaining the following; medicalmonitoring, medical referrals and consultations with English-speaking doctors, hospitaladmittance and coordination to ensure timely access to medical care, facilitation ofhospital payments, coordination of insurance information, medications, vaccines, bloodtransfers, medical devices and repatriation of mortal remains for overseas travelers andtranslation services. The contractor is expected to provide medical translations toinclude telephonic language assistance with medical incidents or medical translations ofmedical records to the extent required to resolve the medical emergency.The trigger for a medical transport to the U.S. is a patient requiring accompanyingmedical personnel during transport.  Decisions to evacuate based on this trigger will bea joint determination between the contractor and NASA.The offerors responsibility begins upon being informed of a medical event involving anemergency of a NASA traveler.  The process of notifying the contractor will be finalizedat the time of award and is dependent upon the technical approach of the successfulofferor. Historically, the enrollee, the NASA doctors, and/or NASA management hasinformed the contractor of a medical event.  Medical assistance can require in-patienthospitalization or require definitive care of some sort, whether it is in-patient oroutpatient. CLIN 001A:The Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) for transportation of a person with an emergencymedical condition may be utilized for temporary-duty travelers (TDYs) when applicable. For instance, employees on TDY requiring definitive inpatient or outpatient medical carefollowing minor emergencies and not triggering the requirement for a medical transport tothe US, NASA will return the traveler to the US by using the credit of the existingreturn airline ticket of the traveler.	However, any additional costs for providing therequired services will be the responsibility of the contractor.  However, if a majorincident occurs which triggers a medical transport to the US (i.e. a patient requiringaccompanying medical personnel during transport) all evacuation cost will be theresponsibility of the contractor and no additional cost will be paid by NASA.  It isestimated that TDY travelers are approximately 95% of the estimated trips.CLIN 001B:For permanent change of station (PCS) requiring definitive inpatient or outpatientmedical care following minor emergencies and not triggering a medical transport to theUS, the contractor shall not be responsible for the returning airline ticket of thetraveler.  However, any additional costs for providing the required services will be theresponsibility of the contractor.  If a major incident occurs which triggers a medicaltransport to the US (i.e. a patient requiring accompanying medical personnel duringtransport) all evacuation cost will be the responsibility of the contractor and noadditional cost will be paid by NASA.  It is estimated that PCS travelers areapproximately 5% of the estimated trips. NASA JSC currently has employees permanentlystationed in Moscow and Star City Russia,  The Hague, Netherlands, and Tsukuba, Japan. These employees travel frequently from and within their international country ofresidence.The contractor is responsible for all costs excluding the medical bills as that is theresponsibility of the NASA traveler receiving medical attention. It is intended for thecontractor to guarantee payment of hospital expenses in the event of a medical emergency.It will be the contractors responsibility to collect the necessary insurance informationfrom the NASA traveler when required.  The contractor is expected to coordinate paymentof medical expenses with the NASA traveler receiving medical attention and/or theirinsurer. The traveling member and NASA shall be responsible jointly for reimbursement ofmedical expenses if the contractor is not reimbursed within a reasonable timeframe.  II. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE Delivery of services are required from the date of award through the date of expirationof the purchase order, expected to be one year with four (4) one year options;notwithstanding continuations under task orders issued pursuant to FAR 52.216-22,paragraph(d). III. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS A.	Historical Data:NASA Johnson Space Center employees historically make approximately 1200 trips overseasper year.  (See attachment 2 for actual data) 60% of trips no longer than 10 days  30% of trips no longer than 30 days  5% of trips or up to 120 days 5% of trips are between 120 days to 365 days (including NASA PCS employees and eligibledependents)*This is a breakdown of trips not travelers and some travelers make more than one trip. **There are approximately 3200 Civil Servant employees eligible for coverage under thiscontract and of this number approximately 600 historically traveled internationally tocomprise  approximately 1200 trips.NASAs Historical data assumes a total of 1  full blown medical evacuations every 2years and 2 semi medical evacuations every year.  An example of a semi medical evacuationwould be an employee breaking an ankle but is to return to the US without accompanyingmedical personnel.. See Attachment entailed Historical data of travelers/trips for additional information.B.	Past Performance: Offerors shall provide a minimum of 3 (three) Past performance sources of informationand references that demonstrates their expertise and ability to successfully perform theSOW requirements for evaluation by the Government.

NASA is responsible for ensuring payment to the awardee for all members that are enrolledin the membership plan.  The offeror should propose a CLIN structure that provides thecost for the technical approach that meets the requirements. Potential offerors maysubmit competitive pricing as a fixed price group rate or a per traveler fixed rate.However, all services shall be quoted as a pre-paid fixed price as NASA does notanticipate an itemized CLIN structure and all prices should be all inclusive (by type oftraveler such as PCS and TDY) with the exception of the F. Optional Security EvacuationRequirements.Offerors may propose fees for travelers based upon trip duration periods or upon its ownavailable commercial services. Offerors shall propose prepaid fixed price service(s)including profit/fee with and without security evacuations. D.

Sheis admitted to the intensive care unit in Tsukuba and is on ventilator support. She isotherwise stable and is on anti-seizure medication and is responsive to commands. Thepatient is originally from North Carolina, with family in the North Carolina area. Sheand the family would like definitive care in North Carolina, and she has been acceptedfor transfer by the Cancer Center of North Carolina. Please describe your response/action plan.  Note: For the purposes of this exercise please assume that the patient isintubated with an endotracheal tube and is on primary assist control ventilator supportand sedated.2) A 42 year old male was playing volleyball in Star City, Russia when he stepped in ahole and sustained a tri-malleolar fracture of the left ankle. He was seen in the NASAremote clinic and x-rays confirm the fracture. He was placed in a posterior plastersplint. He has received previous orthopedic care in Houston for his knee, and would likethe same surgeon to fix his ankle. Due to the swelling, surgery will be scheduled inabout 48-72 hours to allow the swelling to recede. The NASA surgeon believes he canreturn to the US with accompanying medical personnel, but preferably business class sothat he may elevate his leg, and use crutches non-weight bearing. Please describe yourresponse / action plan. 3) A 52 year old astronaut is performing Sea Survival in the Black Sea. After severalruns in the capsule he is noted to be in tachycardia. Upon EKG placement, he is noted tobe in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 110. He is given a beta blocker bythe NASA surgeon and is stable with a rate of 94. The NASA surgeon is going to place himon subcutaneous Lovenox and a beta blocker and believes the patient can return to theU.S. via commercial air transportation with an escort. Please describe your response /action plan. Note: For the purposes of this exercise please assume that the patient islocated at the Port of Odessa in the Ukraine.  The destination is the Cleveland ClinicHospital in Cleveland, Ohio for ablation therapy. He is stable on lovenox subcutaneoustherapy.E.	Registration/Tracking Process:Offerors shall describe their intended on-line processes or procedures used to registerNASA travelers for international emergency services. (For processing NASA travelers) F.	Optional Security Evacuation Requirement: NASA is considering ordering emergency security evacuation services. A firm fixed priceand the offerors commercial terms and conditions should be submitted separately for thisoption; however, is not required to be considered for award.  Once NASA makes an award,this option may or may not be exercised.  The Security Evacuation Option should bepriced separately and is not currently included in the NTE of $500,000.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to include the following changes: (1) Section I Funding Opportunity Description: add additional Focus Area for FY12 (December call); and (2) Section IV.3, Submission Dates and Times: added December Call FY12 Submission date and changed FY13 submission dates. No other changes have been made.
<p>(1) Insert the following under Section I: FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION: and After Focus Areas for FY12: <br /><br />Focus Areas for FY12 (December call for papers):</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heuristic-based Trust Mechanisms</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Heuristic - refers to experience-based techniques for problem solving, learning, and discovery. Heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution, where an exhaustive search is impractical. With increasing focus on assured information sharing, it is critical that processes supporting data transfer across security domains are trusted and secure. Existing cross domain data sharing processes traditionally require a human reviewer to determine whether a document contains questionable content, and then decide whether or not to pass it on to another domain. However, the growing volume of information and the inconsistencies associated with human review activities have traditionally resulted in bottlenecks. Operators require new heuristic-based tools that leverage experience-based techniques for learning, and discovery to increase the efficiency and accuracy of cross domain information sharing. The goal is to capture the human reviewers' actions over time and use this corpus of expert decisions to seed cognitive systems to help predict which products are worthy and not worthy to be passed, , as well as those that require additional human intervention. These groupings are dynamic, and will need to respond dynamically to changing rules and conditions as well as prevent malicious actors from misusing the system. The solutions requested from the vendor community must meet these challenges, be able to improve the reviewers' performance by some significant multiple, while decreasing the overall risk of inappropriate release and/or inappropriate retention of data by a small percentage. These plus other metrics on performance (speed, accuracy, etc) are relevant in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross Domain Video Teleconferencing</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Video teleconferencing is in common usage in DoD and IC, allowing better communications with fewer miscues. One of the major problems is that not all users are on the same networks or operating at the same level of security. As such, it behooves us to create a secure cross-security-domain video teleconferencing capability. Such a capability would use existing commodity endpoints &amp; infrastructure, without modification of the endpoints and with minimal additional infrastructure across multiple security domains. It would allow for both point-to-point and multipoint teleconferences to be set up, run, and securely closed. It would authenticate endpoints and/or users, persistently identify to users that the VTC was across security domains operating at some defined (highest common or lower) security level, and reduce covert channels (one potential method is to filter audio, video, and other relevant information streams (synchronization, etc) to a degree consistent with maintaining useful VTC capability.) Latency, synchronization of audio &amp; video, quality of image/sound, efficiency of communications, degree of covert channel mitigation, and degree of assurance of cross-domain flows are all relevant metrics for this effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secure Orchestration for Cross Domain Release</span></strong>:<br /><br />To meet increasingly stringent security requirements, information to be passed across security domains must go through one of many well defined processes. These processes build the assurance that the proper review, approval, handling, and dissemination of a piece of data did in fact occur in the required fashion. Interfacing with many third party solutions, tracking the progress along a workflow, and providing a secure solution for certification are some of what make this a challenging problem. The goal of this topic is to demonstrate a high assurance, accreditable solution capable of receiving input (files and metadata) from humans and machines and securely orchestrate their validation and/or redaction through multiple third-party engines prior to potentially releasing this information to external humans and/or systems. This explicitly requires securely configurable routing between these engines in parallel, serial, and/or through a load balanced set. This routing must allow for multiple potential behaviors at decision points, to include failure with or without reporting back to originator, deconfliction of results and successful validation. Each of these engines need to be monitored, with the current classification of the engine, the contents it has processed, the source and sink of information passing through it, its performance, the report(s) given on the information passing through each, etc all contributing to decisions in the configured routing. Example engines include state-of-the-art file type recognition, multi-system malware detection, schema validation, certificate validation, digital signature validation, encryption/decryption, content filters, etc. These engines must be modular - if a new capability comes into production it should be easily configured into the Secure Orchestration capability with little or no alteration to either code base.</p>
<p>(2) Replace IV.3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES in its entirety with the following:<br /><br />3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 12 by 1 Aug 11, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FY12 (December</strong> <strong>call) by 1 Dec 11</strong></span> and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FY 13 by 1 Nov 12</span></strong>. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2013, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. The closing date for this BAA is 30 September 2013. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>No other changes have been made.</p>

The NNCO organizes meetings of the NSET Subcommittee and its working groups. It also organizes NNI-sponsored workshops and, as appropriate, publishes reports of those workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NNCO coordinates development of information on the NNI and its activities for Congress when requested. The NNCO organizes public input and outreach activities; future examples may include web dialogues, citizens' panels, consensus conferences, and educational events. The NNCO arranges for the triennial review of the NNI by the National Research Council of the National Academies.
<p><br />The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is the U.S. Federal Government's interagency program for coordinating research and development (R&amp;D) and enhancing communication and collaboration in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Twenty-five federal agencies participate in the NNI and individually and cooperatively expedite the discovery, development, and deployment of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology to serve the public good.</p>
<p>The goals of the NNI, as established by the agencies in the 2011 NNI Strategic Plan, are to:&nbsp;advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development program;&nbsp;foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit;&nbsp;develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology; and&nbsp;support responsible development of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The activities of the NNI R&amp;D Program are organized into eight categories, or Program Component Areas (PCAs). The NNI PCAs cut across the interests and activities of the participating agencies and represent areas where achieving the goals of the NNI can be expedited through interagency coordination. The PCAs are:<br /><br />1. Fundamental nanoscale phenomena and processes<br />2. Nanomaterials<br />3. Nanoscale devices and systems<br />4. Instrumentation research, metrology, and standards for nanotechnology<br />5. Nanomanufacturing<br />6. Major research facilities and instrumentation acquisition<br />7. Environment, health, and safety<br />8. Education and societal dimensions<br /><br />The NNI R&amp;D Program is facilitated and coordinated by the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee, which reports through the Committee on Technology to the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council. The purpose of NSET is to implement relevant portions of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-153) and any other Federal statute related to nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&amp;D.</p>
In support of the aforementioned activities,&nbsp;the contractor will be required to&nbsp;provide program and financial management services, technical expertise in facilitation support, strategic planning support, technical writing, information technology support, operations support, logistical support and project and administrative staff support for the NNCO and the NNI R&amp;D Program, as well as in new topics that may arise in response to changing priorities. <br /><br />This requirement is unrestricted.&nbsp; A single contract will be awarded for all required services. NSF anticipates offering a one-year time and materials contract&nbsp;with four one-year options. The solicitation is anticipated to be available on or about&nbsp;November 3, 2011. All potential offerors should download the solicitation from the following web site: http:\\www.fedbizops.gov. All amendments to the solicitation will also be posted to the web site.

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort. This acquisition has been Set Aside for Small Business. Only small businesses, qualifying under NAICS Code 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services" (gross receipts averaging not more than $25 million annually for the past three years) will be eligible for award
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.
Contractors (Small Businesses) interested in participating in this competitive procurement are invited to submit formal proposals in response to the attached solicitation.

<p style="text-align: left; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">BACKGROUND:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is a focal point within the Department of Defense (DoD) for Information Assurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Program Executive Office, Mission Assurance &amp; Network Operations (PEO-MA) within DISA acquires, develops, engineers and implements DoD Information Assurance and NetOps capabilities. Within PEO-MA, the Program Control and Acquisition Division (IA1) has primary responsibility for all acquisition and financial management issues, including the DoD Planning, Programming, and Budget Execution (PPBE) cycle, within the DISA Information Assurance (IA) community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DISA uses a number of automated tools for the collection and documentation of requirements and their related cost projections. The primary tool used by the IA1 organization for these activities is the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IRIS is a SQL database and active web interface residing on DECC (Defense Enterprise Control Center) provided servers and connects to the DISANet through the unclassified backbone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IRIS has been developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 and Infratgistics NetAdvantage Control Suite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The operational software on the server is SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Architect (with possible upgrade to SQL Server 2008 in the future) and Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">The database stores information concerning the justification of funds, program management, acquisition packages, funding documents, contract awards, and contract management. Currently, the initiative is focused on servicing the DISA IA community by conducting acquisition and program management related activities, but other components of the program management life cycle (e.g., property management and logistics support) may be considered for future development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, recently IRIS use has been expanded to include other organizations within DISA and there is the potential of expanded use by other organizations in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IRIS needs high-quality system integration<span style="COLOR: #3366ff"> </span>services to implement functional and performance enhancements required to support increased use of the system.

The firm should demonstrate ability to provide the following minimum personnel to perform work per task order: three soils lab technicians; two geotechnical design engineers; one engineering technician; one CADD draft person ; one 2-person survey crew; and two drill crews." <br>To comply with this Selection Criteria, does the Tulsa District require that in Section D Organization Chart and Section E Resumes we include resumes for 9 soil technicians, 6 geotechnical design engineers, three engineering technicians, 3 CADD draft persons, 6 survey crew personnel, and 6 drill crew personnel in addition to listing capacity/numbers of personnel for these categories in Section H under Capacity?<br><br>Answer:<br>As indicated in paragraph 4e, resumes must be submitted for each employee required to meet the minimums stated in paragraph 3b.   While paragraph 3b lists the types of labor disciplines required to work each task order, it is not necessary to have entirely different sets of team members work the three simultaneous task orders.  Your firm may propose to use the same key personnel on multiple simultaneous task orders if you intend to propose that those key personnel will be able to successfully perform the required activities for all task orders concurrently without causing a delay or providing lesser quality.   <br><br><br><br>Question:<br>(1)   The organizational chart according to SF330 format criteria is to be located within Section D.

The narrative should be included in Section D.<br>An organization chart shall be included as part of Section D.  This should include subcontractors, identified by their office location and what function they will be performing.  The organization chart and narrative should include both the prime contractor and subcontractors, and should list all key personnel, their function, and their office information.  Foldouts of the organization chart or narrative are not allowed and shall not be considered.

The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsive, responsible bidder whose written quote is considered most advantageous to the Government, both in price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers proposals and are in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance and 2) Price. Factors 1 and 2 will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. Past Performance shall be considered significantly more important than price (factor 2).<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified or FAR 19.1404, if your firm is a SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer for this acquisition, please respond by email to Karen Marshall at<br /><a href="mailto:karen.m.marshall@uscg.mil">karen.m.marshall@uscg.mil</a> or Fax at 757-628-4562.

If two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance.

To assist in the completion of the IAA, Government information has been pre-populated. Each attendee will also be required to register in the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIS) upon entry to the base. Due to these requirements, substitution of individuals attending the conference will not be permitted. A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement is attached for your information.
