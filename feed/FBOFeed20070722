<DESC>Overview:
Modular Command Post Systems (MCPS) are self-contained, highly mobile, modular, and extensible systems comprised of hardware and software components that can be assembled to create an infrastructure that can be tailored to meet a wide variety of general and special purpose applications. 
Applications:
?	Military Command and Control Applications 
?	Mobile Police Command Posts 
?	Security Monitoring for Large Events 
?	Civil-Military Operations Centers (CMOC) 
?	Chemical-Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) Ops Center 
?	Homeland Defense Applications 
Specifications:

A framework structure adapts to handle small or large units and is easily packed, transported, and assembled without need for special tools.  The framework structure is composed of a variety of standard truss structures made of 2 inch aircraft aluminum.  The truss members lock together without tools to create mounting fixtures for horizontal and vertical work surfaces, video display panels, video projectors, lighting, speakers, and other personal equipment.  Built-in power, video, and network cables increase readiness and reduce time for setup and rapid movement to new locations.

Cable Management: 

All MCPS employ built-in cable plants that are composed of fiber
optics, copper, or a combination.  Power distribution can connect
directly to mobile power equipment or be isolated by Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS).  Unique CAT-5 cabling and video switch configurations are used for video distribution. Video source and destination switching can be controlled using onscreen, graphic-based controls using Java plug-in technology.
Video can also be distributed via the built-in networks using video compression techniques.  Smart Table technology provides portable, folded tables with built-in cable and network components, to be ?ganged together?
in a variety of configurations to be tailored to specific needs. Power and two networks are standard with clip-on video, audio, and digital voice terminal distribution systems available.  

Equipment:
 
Use of laptop computers is ideal for size, weight and portability requirements. Virtually all types of laptops can be accommodated.  Rack-mounted ?Blade Workstation? technology with single or dual flat-panel monitors enhances portability and reduces set-up time.  Use of large flat panel and video projectors is supported by the framework and cable distribution system.  Support processors, video and communications systems are packaged and tailored for each application and integrated with the built-in cable plant.

Smart Table Concept:

? A compact and portable design.
? Molded polypropylene surfaces that are weather, impact, and scratch resistant.
? Powder coated, steel reinforced frame (72? W x 30? D x 29? H).
? Steel 1.125? diameter legs that support up to 200 lbs.
? Integrated handles for carrying ease (folded size 30? x 36? x 6.75?). Easy to stock and pack.
? Folds in half into a 3-foot section for efficient transportation and storage.
? Weight with integrated components is less than 50 lbs.


System shall include:
1 each Frame assembly capable of handling the following:
3 each projectors with hangers
3 each 4' X 3' screens with hangers
3 each 4' x 3' white boards with hangers
