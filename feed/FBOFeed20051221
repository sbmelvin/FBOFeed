The 186-D Waste Acid Reservoir was constructed of acid-proof brick, 3-ply waterproof membrane, vitrified pipe, #8 lead flashing, and gunnite.  The reservoir was originally constructed to receive waste acid from processes in the 186 D Building.  However, the 186-D Building was never used for its designed purpose, but was used for storage.  In 1979 both the 186-D Building and the waste acid reservoir were demolished.  Because no documentation was found on the disposal of the lead flashing, it is assumed that the lead flashing was disposed in place during the demolition.  The site dimensions are approximately 100 feet long by 100 feet wide by 15 feet deep.
•	116-D-8
The 116-D-8 is the former 100-D Cask Storage Pad.  Decontamination solutions were used on equipment and casks and frequent spills occurred during its use.  Supposedly the pad had two drains, one of which handled pad decontamination and rain runoff.  The other drain discharged to a french drain, the location of which is unknown.  There may be a french drain beneath the loading dock, located on the west side of the pad, which provided drainage for the site which may be contaminated as well.  The site is covered with gray grout to immobilize contamination.  The site dimensions are approximately 100 feet long by 100 feet wide.
•	100-D-29
The 100-D-29 site is an effluent leak from the 107-DR retention basin which occurred in 1951.  The approximate site dimensions are 250 feet long by 50 feet wide and 15 feet deep.
•	UPR-100-D-5
The UPR-100-D-5 site is an effluent leak from the 107-DR retention basin which occurred in 1951.  The approximate site dimensions are 140 feet long by 100 feet wide and 15 feet deep.
•	1607-D2:2
The 1607-D2:2 site is a tile field associated with the 1607-D2 septic system.  The approximate site dimensions are 300 feet long by 130 feet wide and 15 feet deep. 
•	100-D-30
The 100-D-30 site is a hexavalent chromium soil contamination area associated with the former 190-D complex.  The site dimensions are approximately 420 feet long by 70 feet wide and 15 feet deep.
•	100-D-56
The 100-D-56 site consists of two 3 inch diameter steel pipelines which distributed sodium dichromate solution throughout the 100-D Area.  The total length of piping is approximately 7,200 feet and is buried approximately 6 feet from ground surface.

The contaminated materials will be size reduced as necessary, and loaded into 20-ton containers.  The containers will be staged and manifested for transport to Hanford’s Environmental Restoration disposal Facility (ERDF).  The work to be completed does not include the transportation to and disposal of the contaminated material at ERDF.

The principal components of the work to be performed under the specifications include the following:   A.	General Requirements - Administrative requirements, procedural requirements, temporary facilities, and controls which apply to the execution of work. B.	Schedule A - Schedule A of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of Primary and Emergency river intake structures, an Obermeyer-type maintenance gate, channel and cofferdam grading, channel erosions protection measures including grouted rock and riprap, intake structure access roads and surfaces, hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size, air and water piping from the pump station to the intake contained in a utility trench and a concrete-encased 48-inch diameter casing pipe beneath the river for future extension of the 30-inch diameter GDPUD pipeline from the pump station to the south side of the river.  The river intake structures will provide water to the American River Pump Station constructed under Phase I and are to be constructed on the north bank of the American River channel directly beneath the pump station. 1.	Primary Intake Structures - The Primary Intake structure consists of a reinforced concrete and grouted boulder chute with tilted, wedge-wire intake screens and air backwash.  Collection chambers beneath the screens deliver diverted water to six 30-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipes.  The concrete pipes carry diversions to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance and are controlled by manually operated knife-gate valves. 2.	Emergency Intake Structure - The Emergency intake will consist of a coarse bar screen divided into four separate chambers.  Each of the four chambers discharges to a concrete box collection conduit behind the intake through various sized openings.  The collection conduit varies in size from 3.5 foot by 3.5 foot to 6 foot by 6 foot.  Flows collected in the collection conduit are controlled by a manually operated 6 foot by 6 foot cast iron sluice gate.  The sluice gate discharges to a maintenance and sedimentation vault which in turn discharges to a 7 foot by 7 cast-in-place Emergency Intake Conduit.  The Emergency Intake conduit extends approximately 80 feet to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance. 3.	Maintenance Gate - A 16 foot wide by 9 foot high Obermeyer-type maintenance gate is located between the Primary and Emergency Intakes.  The gate will allow river flows less than 2,500 cfs to be diverted away from the Intake Channel to facilitate maintenance work. 4.	Channel Modifications - Channel modifications will consist of grouted rock and riprap lining of an approximate 900 foot reach of the American River channel at the location of the intake structures and additional riprap protection of the cofferdam for another 900 feet upstream.  A 30-foot depth cutoff wall extends approximately 220 feet across the channel at the entrance to the intake area.  In addition to the grouted rock protection, channel modifications will include construction of a new channel cross section through plug areas located at the tunnel entrance and exit. 5.	Air and Water Piping - Air and water piping will extend from the pump station a distance of approximately 140 feet down the valley side to the Intake Vault structure.   Piping will include: a.	4- to 8-inch diameter ductile iron, steel and stainless steel lines for air backwash of the Primary Intakes;  2-inch diameter stainless steel pipe for inflation of the Obermeyer Maintenance Gate;  6-inch diameter ductile iron line for washdown at the intake:  ?-inch diameter nylon tubing in 6-inch PVC carrier pipe for actuation of backwash system pneumatic butterfly valves;  ?-inch diameter tubing contained in carrier pipes for level sensing and flushing of stilling wells;  additional 6-inch PVC carrier pipes  for future use.  All of the above located in an excavated rock trench between the Pump Station Vault and the Intake Vault backfilled with flowfill.  Trench conditions below the Intake Vault vary. b.	6 pneumatically actuated butter fly valves located in the Intake Vault controlled by 6 solenoid valves located in the Pump Station Vault and linked to a SCADA system. 6.	Intake Access - Access to the top surfaces of the intake structures and Obermeyer Gate for maintenance work will be provided by a drive-down access road.  Access to the interiors of the Emergency Intake and the Intake Vault will be provided through hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size.   The largest hatches are intended to allow both a skidsteer and a large sediment bin to be lowered into the structure.  The bin could be used in combination with a skid-steer to remove accumulated sediment. 7.	GDPUD Pipeline - A 48-inch diameter concrete encased casing pipe is to be constructed across the river channel upstream of the Emergency Intake.  The casing pipe will provide for future construction of the proposed 30-inch diameter GDPUD steel pressure line currently stubbed out at the Pump Station east wall.   8.	Closure of the River Diversion Tunnel - The inlet and outlet of the existing 33-foot diameter horseshoe shaped diversion tunnel will be closed. The inlet closure shall consist of sheet piles linked together and supported at the top and bottom to cover the tunnel opening.  The entrance will then be backfilled to cover the face of the sheet piles. The tunnel outlet shall be closed with rock fill. The rock fill shall be allowed to fall into its natural angle of repose inside the tunnel. The outside rock fill slope shall not exceed two horizontal to one vertical. Approximately 1520 square feet of sheet pile and 8 cubic yards of concrete will be required for closure of the tunnel inlet. Approximately 9000 cubic yards of rock fill will be required for closure of the tunnel outlet.  9.	Diversion Access Road - An access road shall be constructed from the existing pump station site to the intake structure in schedule A. The access road shall be concrete over an aggregate base and the work will include guardrail and drainage facilities. Total length of road to be constructed is approximately 552 feet. C.	Optional Schedule B - Schedule B of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of the Public Access Components of the project. The Public Access Components consist of a park entrance building, parking areas and turnarounds, improvements to access roads, and construction of a new trail. 1.	Park Entrance Building - A 10-foot by 22-foot, single story, block masonry building will be constructed just off Maidu Drive at the entrance to the park.  The building will have water and electrical service.  A precast concrete sanitary vault will be installed to provide sewer service for the building. 2.	Parking Areas and Turnarounds - A paved and striped parking area, consisting of approximately 15 spaces (1 ADA), will be constructed just off Maidu Drive.  The parking area will include a drinking fountain, trash containers, and a kiosk.  A second parking area, consisting of a paved and striped parking area consisting of approximately 50 spaces (2 ADA), will be constructed at the existing Auburn Dam Batch Plant site just above Oregon Bar.  The parking area will include bathrooms, trash containers, and a kiosk. Fencing shall be placed around the existing ponds in this area. Construction of the Maidu and Batch Plant parking areas will consist of minor grading for drainage purposes.  A third parking area will be constructed solely for ADA access near the river channel on a rock bench approximately 1200 feet Northwest of the existing diversion tunnel outlet.  The gravel ADA parking area will be approximately 80 feet by 80 feet.  A gravel road approximately 520 feet long and 15 feet wide will be constructed from an existing road to the ADA parking area.  A turnaround area, to be used by the Department of Parks and Recreation and emergency vehicles, will be constructed next to the river channel approximately 100 feet Northeast and down grade from the ADA parking area.  The gravel turnaround will be approximately 30 feet by 50 feet.  The ADA parking area, ADA access road, and turnaround area will require rock and common soil excavation.  Another gravel turnaround will be constructed near Oregon Bar.  The turnaround will be approximately 50 feet by 50 feet.  Construction of this turnaround will consist mainly of grubbing existing shrubs and some minor grading. 3.	Improvements to Access Roads - Approximately 6,900 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing paved road between Maidu Drive and the Batch Plant parking area will be improved by overlaying the entire width of the existing paved area. Approximately 4,200 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing dirt road between the Batch Plant parking area and river turnaround will be improved.

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.
Per AAFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 
Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), plans to establish a DHS Information Technology (IT) department-wide contract for commodity products under the program name First Source. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. IT commodity products and solutions represents a significant portion of the DHS’s IT budget and are currently provided through a disparate collection of acquisition methods, including Component-centric contracts, task orders against General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and InterAgency Agreements. The establishment of a consolidated portfolio of multiple-award IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department is considered a primary ITAC objective. The First Source Program will support the DHS goal of a functionally integrated Department, promoting standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among and between the various Components with the IT products and systems that enhance mission effectiveness and create economies of scale through the buying-power of the Department as a whole through consolidation of requirements. In support of its mission and strategic goals, DHS requires commercial IT commodity solutions for a wide variety of applications throughout the Department and its 22 Operating Components. DHS needs to access technological advances as they occur, and new business practices that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHS’s Department-wide buying power to obtain competitive prices. Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), producers, and suppliers. The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to: IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology; on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking; and associated product maintenance, installation, and support.  The First Source Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractor’s commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. The First Source procurement is a Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code 541519; the business size standard is 150 employees. First Source is a complementary program to the EAGLE program.  EAGLE contractors will use First Source as a “mandatory for use” source for any equipment requirements in their task orders issued under EAGLE. The First Source procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts.  Contract term is a two-year base period with three one-year options. The Source Selection will be conducted using a best value analysis.  Evaluation factors for award will emphasize price, technical and management solutions, and past performance. The number of contract awards for all commodities will be sufficient to maintain adequate competition for specific delivery orders for products during the entire term of the contract. Offerors will be required to propose their published, commercial IT commodity catalogs for any or all of the required products. Prices for products included in the offerors’ catalogs will be based on the offerors’ proposed Dynamic Pricing Model (DPM). The DPM is the offeror’s proposed pricing mechanism which is devised to continuously assure that the most competitive prices for its offered products are available to DHS for the duration of the contract. First Source is not intended as a direct replacement of any legacy small or large business contracts. Rather, the high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.  Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the delivery order level. First Source contracts will promote the use of performance-based contracting.  Specific equipment requirements will be defined in individual delivery orders that will be competed prior to their issuance.  Delivery orders will have their own delivery or performance period requirements.  IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. DHS intends to conduct an Industry Day in which senior DHS procurement and IT officials will provide an overview of their strategies and perspectives on both Department-wide and Component initiatives. The date for the Industry Day will be announced via FedBizOpps. Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and only two representatives from each company will be allowed.  There is no registration fee associated with attending this event.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail confirming their attendance for the Industry Day session. More information regarding the First Source Program can be found at www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. It is anticipated that the First Source RFP will be released in early September 2005, via FedBizOpps, with contract awards in early CY2006. The draft First Source RFP is posted with this synopsis. Written comments received at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov on or before August 26, 2005 will be considered for inclusion in the final First Source RFP.  Due to the anticipated level of interest, the Contracting Officer will not entertain requests for vendor visitations or marketing calls, or respond to telephonic inquiries.  Future information regarding First Source, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, and vendor questions and DHS responses related to the First Source RFP, when posted, will be released to the public through the FedBizOpps  and the DHS.gov website. Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to DHS at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the NATO Active Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Support Contract.

The successful bidder for the (ALTBMD) Program Management Support Contract (IFB-CO-11485-ALTBMD) will not be allowed to compete as a prime contractor or participate as a subcontractor for the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Support Contract.

The overall objectives of the SE&I Support Contract is to engage the contractor in the 

-	Architecture development and systems engineering of the ALTBMD system of systems
-	Design and development of an integration test bed capable of serving both as a principal design tool and as a validation tool capable of performing an end-to-end test of the entire Alliance ALTBMD Capability
-	Operation of the test bed during design trade studies
-	System test and validation activities, including activities involving the above test

The contract will be for Increment 1, which spans the time of 2007 - 2010 and covers the lower level ALTBMD.

NC3A, with the assistance of the Nations, issued on 06 October 2005 a Market Survey, soliciting industry comments on the outline of the Statement of Work (SOW) for the SE&I contract, which formed part of this Market Survey. The received comments facilitated the drafting of the Invitation for Bid. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged bidding procedure for this IFB will be the Optional Preliminary Bidding Procedure. In this procedure, the formal IFB will be preceded by a Request for Bidders Views (RFBV) on a draft of the IFB. The evaluation procedure for bids received in response to the IFB is envisaged as the Best Value process.  

The rough cost estimate for this effort is Euro 46 million (USD $55 million) for Increment 1 and Euro 9.5 million (USD $11.3 million) per year for O&M. A formal Type B Cost Estimate (TBCE) is expected to be submitted for Infrastructure Committee screening by the first quarter of 2006. The TBCE will provide a more detailed description of the requirements and a refined estimate of costs.

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11844-ALTBMD. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The purpose of the SE&I support contract will be to develop an ALTBMD architecture for NATO based on the approved NATO Reference Architecture to satisfy the NATO Staff Requirement for ALTBMD. The contractor will work with NATO authorities to develop and document a series of Target Architectures, assist the Program Office in maintaining configuration control for the architecture as its elements are fielded, and develop and operate a NATO ALTBMD Integration Test Bed (ITB) as a development tool and a tool to validate the NATO ALTBMD system of systems architecture. The architecture and the ITB will be provided by a single System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contractor. This NATO-wide Active Layered Theater Missile Defense capability, a capability that will be composed of NATO Command, Control and Communications Systems and sensors and interceptors, is assigned to NATO by NATO Nations.

A single contract will be let with the intent of contracting the systems engineering and validation effort. The contract will have three principal tasks: systems engineering and architecture development, design and development of an integration test bed capable of both serving as a principal design tool and as a validation tool capable of performing an end-to-end test of the entire Alliance ALTBMD capability, and operation of the test bed during design trade studies and system test and validation activities. The test bed will also develop the capability to assist the operational community in exercising the ALTBMD capability and in training activities.

The contract period will initially be four years, during which time the test bed will be designed and delivered. It will be used to develop and validate a NATO Target Architecture for NATO ALTBMD that will guide NATO development of a lower layer ballistic missile defense capability.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Bidders, however, in order to submit a meaningful bid, will be allowed access to material in a bidder library that will include material to the level of NATO SECRET. Further performance of the contract will likewise require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at the level of NATO SECRET.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

Where the word proposal or a derivative of that word appears, it is changed to quote or a derivative of that word. This is an unrestricted solicitation. The service is described below: Tactical Demonstration and Evaluation (TAC D&E) Project, Guided Bomb Unit Employment Guidance.  For United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR). Statement of Work (SOW) 1.0 PROJECT OVERVIEW:  The mission of Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1) is to provide standardized advanced tactical training and certification of unit instructor qualifications that support Marine aviation training and readiness and to provide assistance in the development and employment of aviation weapons and tactics.  To meet this mission, MAWTS-1 has a requirement for contractor expertise to analyze overall combat system performance, develop tactics development test plans, collect data, analyze test results and develop tactical guidance for USMC combat units. 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A. BACKGROUND:  Precision Guided Munitions are the weapons of choice in modern air-to-surface warfare. The precision of these weapons makes them ideal for use in urban warfare and in situations where collateral damage and fratricide are major employment considerations.  USMC FA-18 and AV-8B aircraft are employing precision guided bombs such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and the Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) against dynamic, unplanned targets.  These weapons are employed day or night, and during adverse meteorological conditions. However, both of these Guided Bomb Units (GBUs) were initially conceived and designed to be used against fixed, pre-planned targets. When targets are pre-planned, several factors that will significantly improve the Probability of Delivery Success (Ps) are accounted for.  These factors include; the development of precise target coordinates, thorough target area study, predicted weather effects on target acquisition and weapons flight path, seeker capabilities and more.  However, the dynamics of the modern battlefield often require aircraft to flex to a secondary mission, change targets while enroute to their pre-planned objective area, or the mission may be designated from the beginning to be “on-call” support to a general area of responsibility.  In these cases, the aircraft weapon loadout may not provide the optimum weapon-to-target match and possibly invalidate weaponeering that occurred during pre-mission planning to include planned weapon effects, planned release parameters, and employment tactics. B. OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this project is to develop guidance for employing GBUs, with the similar precision effects of pre-planned targets, in a dynamic environment against unplanned targets.  The final products will be actionable procedures, or “rules of thumb”, that can be applied using the best information available in a reactive environment.  The contractor shall have the ability to coordinate with the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) JDAM Target Of Opportunity (TOO), TAC D&E effort in order to expedite the process and reduce the cost of a full TAC D&E project.  The contactor shall also coordinate with other weapons performance initiative such as the Conventional Ordnance Performance Evaluation (COPE) group from Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane, along with initiatives by military and civilian meteorological organizations.  3.0 SPECIFIC TASKS: TASK 1	Project Data Collection Plan.  The contractor will work with the MAWTS-1 Aviation Development, Tactics and Evaluation (ADT&E) action officer to gather existing data and products that will define the capabilities, limitations and vulnerabilities of GBUs employed in a dynamic, unplanned environment.  The contractor will also search for tools and tactical delivery solutions for mitigating unplanned employment variables.  Additionally, the contractor will research existing efforts in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force as well as initiatives within the military meteorological community and identify synergies. TASK 2	Project Test Report.  Develop a project report that documents the results, data collection, and analysis effort.  It shall include a description of the objectives and scenario, tactics employed, data collected, data analyses, and results, conclusions, and recommendations.  Data collected during testing and subsequent data analysis will be used in the development of a GBU Employment Guide. TASK 3	Tactical GBU Employment Guide. The scope of the Tactical GBU Employment Guide shall include the FA-18D equipped with a Northrop Grumman Litening II Pod, and the AV-8B equipped with a Northrop Grumman Litening II Pod, each employing the JDAM and Paveway II.  The Tactical GBU Employment Guide shall provide for each type aircraft configuration a decision matrix and actionable procedures, or “rules of thumb”, for optimizing, sensors, weapon system and weapons delivery techniques for achieving the desired weapons effects in a dynamic planning environment. TASK 4	Monthly Status Reports: Provide monthly progress reports that include the following information: ·Previous month’s accomplishments ·Current or anticipated problems, changes, remarks ·Deliverable status (due dates/delivery dates) ·Plans for the following month TASK 5  Travel: Four trips of 2 days duration each.  Travel shall be to NAS China Lake, CA, Raytheon Tucson, AZ, Eglin AFB, FL and Monterey, CA.  One trip of three days duration to MAWTS-1 in Yuma, AZ, to finalize the Employment Guide.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to issue a full and open, best value competitive solicitation on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) to develop, integrate, deliver, and support the testing of a militarized concept demonstrator Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  The UAS required is considered a Tier II system within the USMC Family of Systems (FoS) context.  The Program of Record (POR) Tier II system is required for close range Joint and MAGTF support levels.  The Tier II system is intended to enhance timely situational awareness and decision-making. The MCWL Tier II System is considered a concept demonstrator.  This concept demonstrator will be used to investigate effectiveness when operated by the Ground Command Element (GCE), and will help evaluate, develop and refine Tier II MAGTF and FoS integration, mission and payload/sensor pairing, tactics, techniques and procedures.  This UAS effort will be a test bed for experimental purposes to inform the Tier II UAS POR.  This Tier II procurement will include a firm fixed price effort for an initial complete UAS with spares support, ancillary equipment (to include mission planning and post mission processing hardware and software), testing, production and preparation of associated documentation, technical manuals, and warranties.  A time and material effort for technical support, field service support, refurbishment, repair services, maintenance service, and training will also be included.   Options are also planned for additional systems, components, and support services th!  rough 2010.  MCWL intends to provide this Tier II System to the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) for an Extended User Assessment (EUA) depending on the actual deployment schedule, preceded by all necessary NAVAIR flight certifications and Marine operator/maintainer training. The Tier II System shall be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or above.  Enhancements to the Tier II System after contract award shall be accomplished via contractor and/or Government generated Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).  The solicitation will specify that the delivery schedule of the first Tier II System shall be within 120 days after contract award. Award will be made to the offeror who represents to the Government the best value based on Technical, Management, Past Performance and Price Factors. The contractor shall deliver a Tier II System consisting of a number of aircraft with mission payloads, ground control station with all necessary communication and data links, necessary launch/recovery ancillary equipment, a remote receive terminal, and a six-month spare parts block.  The spare parts are required to support the Tier II System through acceptance test, two Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs), and an Extended User Assessment (EUA).  For maintenance and sparing considerations, it is expected the Tier II System will operate for up to 300 flight hours per month, and the spare parts block shall support maintenance and repair parts based upon 1,800 flight hours within a six (6) month operating window. It is expected that the Tier II System have, as a minimum, significant Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) detection capabilities. The EO sensor shall be capable of providing “actionable intelligence” based upon human intent, (e.g., determine if an individual is carrying a rifle).  Enhancements to the Tier II System will be by way of contractor and/or Government generated ECPs.  Potential enhancements include, but are not limited to, sensor and payload development such as: Communication Radio Relay; Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Electronic Attack (EA); Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); and Hyper-Spectral Imaging; and power plant development and integration (DoD single fuel initiative). Draft documentation will periodically be posted under solicitation number M67854-06-R-2012 for review and comment.  A draft performance specification is currently posted in FEDBIZOPPS under solicitation number M67854-06-R-2012.  Formal RFP release is planned on or about 09 January 2006.  Proposals will be due 30 days after RFP release. Questions will be entertained up until 5 days prior to proposal receipt.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for noncommercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-06-Q-5030 applies and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The small business set-aside has been dissolved. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends on issuing an award on a sole source basis to TOTAL MARINE SOLUTIONS (TMS), Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33314 for the purchase of one (1)  MarinFloc Neptumatic MOC-20, wastewater treatment process (WWTP) unit, for evaluation of its performance and ability to meet current and anticipated domestic and international discharge requirements. This contractor is the sole U.S. representative of the manufacturer, Marinfloc AB. Marinfloc AB is a Swedish manufacturer of the commercial marine sanitation device, Neptumatic MOC-20, which utilizes mechanical separation, oxidation, and chemicals to treat wastewater (graywater andlor blackwater). NSWCCD classifies this process as an oxidation, flotation, and chlorination technology. NSWCCD has developed a Technology Identification and Assessment Process (TIAP), which is a methodology for identifying, assessing and verifying the!   performance of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) marine sanitation devices (MSDs) for possible use by the Navy. A key part of this process is the test and evaluation (T&E) of MSDs in order to verify performance and application to existing or new ship designs. T&E is a critical step in developing the performance data needed by the NAVSEA Cognizant Technical Authority (CTA) to assess various competing technologies. Based on NSWCCD-63-TM-2005/087 “Marine Sanitation Device Technology-Summary Matrix — September 2005 Version”, the Marinfloc MOC-20 is the only physical/chemical treatment system that uses the combination of oxidation, flotation, and chlorination technologies to treat wastewater. The MarineFloci Neptumatic MOC-20 was identified through technology searches and shipboard installations. A  formal methodology exists which identifies, assesses, analyzes and evaluates potential MSDs for use on Navy ships. The Marmnfloc MOC-20 was the top recommendation for the current eval!  uation, based on its experience in shipboard applications and the fact  that NSWCCD Code 633 has completed a technical assessment, AoA, and point designs. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27 as well as DCN 20041512. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333319 and the applicable business size standard is 500 employees.  This requirement is as follows:   CLIN 0001 – ( 1 ) EA –  MARINFLOC NEPTUMATIC MOC-20STPS SYSTEM (P/N MOC-20) with Roto-Sieve Rotating Inlet Filter Drum, Macerating Feed Pump, Installation, and Training.   Delivery is required 10 weeks ARO and F.O.B.Destination. Final inspection and acceptance will be at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 9500 MacArthur Boulevard, West Bethesda, Maryland 20817-5700. Quotes that are non-compliant with any material requirement of this solicitation may be rejected without further consideration for award. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered by the Agency. A Firm-Fixed Price purchase order will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The following provisions and clauses apply:  52.213-4 {Incorporating 52.222-3, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.225-13, 52.233-3,  52.233-4, 252.204-7003, 52.232-1, 52.232-8, 52.232-11, 52.232-25, 52.233-1  252.243-7001, 52.253-1, 52.222-19, 52.222-20, 252.225-7001, 252.225-7002, 52.232-33, 52.204-7, 252.204-7004, 52.209-6, 52.211-5, 52.211-17, 52.243-1, 52.247-34, 52.211-14 (DO); 52.222-19; 52.252-2}.   NOTE: The following provisions with a "FILL-IN"  MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer:  52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described!   in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>INDUSTRY FORUM NOTICE

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic (NAVFAC LANT) is holding an Industry Forum to determine the interest and capability of industry to participate in a Multiple Award Global Contingency Construction (GCC) Contract.   The work on the GCC (formerly known as CONCAP) includes providing the supervision, equipment, materials, labor, travel and all means necessary to provide the Navy, the Navy on behalf of DOD, and the Navy on behalf of other Federal agencies when authorized, an immediate response for civilian construction contract capability. The construction and related engineering and services would be in response to natural disasters, humanitarian assistance, conflict, or projects with similar characteristics.  This includes occasional projects to ensure readiness to perform under emergency situations.  The scope includes the capability to provide general mobilization services (embarkation) for personnel, equipment and material in support of Naval Construction Forces (NCF) mobilization efforts and similar mobilization efforts.  The work also includes the capability to set up and operate Material Liaison Office (MLO) at a deployed site in support of NCF operations.  The Contractor may be tasked to participate in military exercises.

Work will be predominately construction.  The Contractor, on a limited basis, may be required to provide Base Operating Support (BOS) Services such as:  Air Operations; Port Operations; Morale, Welfare and Recreation Support; Galley; Billeting; Facilities Support; Utilities; Base Support Vehicles and Equipment; and Environmental.  These services are primarily anticipated in support of facilities overseas, but may also be ordered for work in the United States in support of disaster recovery efforts and other contingency operations.  The Service Contract Act and other applicable clauses will be incorporated by individual task order, as necessary, for stateside work.  

Because of the potential need for additional contingency capability and the benefits of changing some elements of the current contract based on lessons learned, the Government proposes to solicit for a Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  Any potential solicitation and contracts that may result will require the contractor or contractors to be capable of providing global construction response on simultaneous task orders.  Any resulting contract(s) will be Cost Plus Award Fee, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract for a base year and four option years.  The maximum dollar value for the GCC program will be $750 Million with no more than two contractors.  Task orders issued under the GCC will be competed among the GCC awardees.    

The Government requests your input on the proposed approach and other information to be presented at an Industry Forum on 10 January 2006, 2:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Select Norfolk, 1570 Military Highway, Norfolk, VA.  FORUM ATTENDEES MUST PRE-REGISTER BY EMAIL TO PAMELA ARGILAN at Pamela.Argilan@navy.mil.

The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice.  This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal nor an Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Point of Contact: Laurette Brunner, (757) 322-8289/laurette.brunner@navy.mil or Pamela Argilan, (757) 322-8261/Pamela.Argilan@navy.mil.

Projects involve new construction, site work, landscaping, repair and maintenance of water treatment/distribution, drainage and sewage collection/treatment disposal systems in various NAVFAC PACIFIC locations.  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and two one-year option years.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional two years.  The annual fee for any year may not exceed $2,000,000 and per project limitation is $1,200,000.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $5,000,000.  In the event the maximum annual not-to-exceed amounts are not met, the Government reserves the right to carry-over any unused capacity to the following year(s) but shall not exceed $2,000,000 per year.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated construction cost of project is between less than $25,000 and $5,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is April 2006.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for designing wastewater/potable water collection and treatment system, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in the Pacific basins and/or tropical environments similar to Hawaii and Guam; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for designing wastewater/potable water collection and treatment system, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in the Pacific basins and/or tropical environments similar to Hawaii and Guam; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 06 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 75.83% to SB, 15.8% to SDB, 14.23% to WOSB, 1.28% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Microarray Facility (ATC), plans to procure on a sole source basis, Mouse Genome Oligonucleotide Set (MEEBO), catalog number: 0L-10-123 with Invitrogen Corporation, 1600 Fraday Avenue, Carlsbad California 92008.  

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The NCI’s Advanced Technology Center (ATC) has as one of its missions the goal of manufacturing quality microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, provide training protocols and technical support for NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  The ATC facility is responsible for supplying arrays for the entire NCI and other collaborators.  The NCI has a significant investment in array technologies and the Mouse Genome Oligonucleotide Set.  Invitrogen Corporation is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the Mouse Genome Oligonucleotide Set (MEEBO) composed of ~38,800 70mer amino modified probes and controls.  In addition, it is the largest mouse set known to the NCI that is available on the market today.  Other known mouse sets are smaller and less annotated.  It is critical that the NCI researchers continue to use the MEEBO set for printing of the arrays as changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the research already in progress.  Without this oligo set the ATC microarray facility will not be able to provide the NCI investigators with the most up-to-date arrays for their expression profiling studies, CGH, (comparative genomic hybridization), and other experiments.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on January 4, 2006.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please reference NCI-60021-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) NHLBI-WH-06-09 will be available on or about January 9, 2006.     The objective of the RFP is to maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data generated by the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) research studies.  The overall WHI program is intended to improve knowledge about the predictors and prevention of some of the more common diseases affecting older women (cardiovascular diseases, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and fractures).  Because of their importance to public health, the BAA will expand existing efforts within WHI centered around these diseases.  However, extensive information was also collected on other outcomes, such as other cancers, cognition, and functional status, and proposals using these phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will also be considered.  NHLBI anticipates that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  This BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive yet efficient investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease outcomes.  Focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications.

Detailed information on the WHI program will be found at http://www.whiscience.org/. The NHLBI anticipates awarding contracts based on technical merit, available funds, and programmatic balance. Prospective Offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference on February 27, 2006, from 1:00-3:00 pm, at the Natcher Building on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland. NHLBI staff will explain the purpose of the initiative, provide instructions about the proposal process and answer questions. Questions provided by February 20, 2006 will be answered at the conference. Offeror institutions are urged to send a representative to this conference. All attendees, as well as anyone who cannot attend the pre-proposal conference, will be given access, through an amendment to the Solicitation, to any distributed materials, questions and answers, and a summary of the discussion. These materials and additional information about the meeting will be posted with the BAA. Attendance is not a pre-requisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.

This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although eight to ten awards are anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.     The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov.     Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.     It is also offerors’ responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.     Letters of intent are due no later than February 10, 2006.     This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal(RFP) for Data for PROPULSIVE LANDING SYSTEMS FOR EARTH ENTRY CAPSULES. NASA/LaRC has a requirement for component data, performance data, and consulting services associated with propulsive landing systems for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  NASA intends to procure the propulsive landing system data and consulting services as a non-commercial item using FAR Part 15.	NASA intends to award at least one (1), but no more than two (2) contracts depending on responses received.  Results and data from the contract(s) will be used to assist NASA in developing a propulsive landing system design for the CEV.  The resulting propulsive landing system design will be evaluated against alternative CEV landing system concepts as part of a landing system trade study being conducted by NASA.  The base period of the contract(s) will be approximately 120 calendar days.  NASA intends to include two Options in addition to the base contract.  The Option 1 period of performance will be approximately 180 calendar days from the day the Option is exercised, and is intended to include additional propulsive landing system design and analysis support, as well as the design, fabrication, delivery, and testing support of propulsion system components.  The Option 2 period of performance will be approximately 365 calendar days from the day the Option is exercised, and is intended to include additional propulsive landing system design and analysis support, as well as the design, fabrication, delivery, and testing support of propulsive system components.  The following landing attenuation system specifications are preliminary and therefore subject to change.  The specifications are intended to depict the general performance envelope of the anticipated propulsive landing system.  Specific, more-detailed performance requirements will be developed by the Government at a later date.  (1)	The landing system shall be designed for a CEV landing within a Government-controlled land range in the continental United States, but must also be suitable for off-nominal water landings associated with launch abort scenarios.  (2) The landing system shall reduce the landing loads of the CEV to within human-acceptable limits.  The human-acceptable limits will be defined by the Government at a later date.  (3) The landing system shall prevent the CEV capsule from over-turning or rolling over during or after landing.  (4) The landing system shall operate within acceptable limits for the following ranges of landing conditions: a) CEV weight of approximately 21,000 pounds; b) vertical landing velocity of approximately 22 ft/sec to 35 ft/sec; c) horizontal landing velocity of approximately 0 ft/sec to 51 ft/sec; d)  a capsule attitude of approximately 0 to 20 degrees.  (5)  The landing system shall stow within the available volume within the CEV capsule, be capable of withstanding extended duration space environments, and then be capable of being deployed during the CEV terminal descent at Earth.  The available CEV volume will be provided by NASA at a later date.  (6) The landing system shall be capable of being successfully deployed at angles-of-attack up to +/- 20 degrees during the CEV terminal descent.  (7) The landing system shall be at a state of technological readiness such that a full-scale system can be designed, fabricated, and tested before September, 2007. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,000 employees respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about January 31, 2006 with an anticipated offer due date 30 days from the release date of the RFP. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/LaRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=23  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (DESPR) at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) conducts epidemiologic, behavioral and biometric studies relating to reproductive, maternal, and child health.  The Division consists of the Biometry and Mathematical Statistics Branch, the Epidemiology Branch, and the Prevention Research Branch.  Studies focus on reproductive processes, pregnancy, infant mortality and morbidity, child growth and development, clinical trials, vaccinology, and community-based interventions designed to promote healthy behaviors.  These studies make use of a variety of research strategies including surveys, observational designs, randomized trials, and demonstration/education projects.  

In the past half century, labor and delivery practice has been guided by the Friedman curve. However, labor management has changed substantially during that period.   Several findings strongly indicate that new, evidence-based definitions of labor protraction and arrest are needed.   In order to establish new definitions, two important issues must be addressed.  First, what is the average range of labor progression in current population?  Second, although we can increase the time limits for the definition of labor protraction and arrest and allow labor to go longer before intervention, is it safe for the mother and the fetus?  The NICHD intends to conduct a retrospective observational study using data already collected in many hospitals and healthcare organizations in the United States to: (1) to describe contemporary labor progression in the U.S. population; and (2) to determine the appropriate time to perform a Cesarean delivery for women with labor protraction and arrest. The answers to these questions will have profound impacts on obstetric practice.

The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified Small Business Concerns to serve as a Data Coordinating Center for the observational study.  Specifically, the successful Contractor shall seek collaboration from institutions that have a comprehensive obstetric database and electronically stored, detailed labor information.  The institutions will also have a neonatal database on every newborn that records severe neonatal complications, and linkable to the obstetric and newborn databases.  The purpose of the resultant contract will be to compile and deliver a substantial database with approximately 200,000 deliveries from up to 20 hospitals for research and to form a NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor.

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Therefore, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this procurement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a Small Business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NICHD.  

The NICHD anticipates issuing one award for a 30-month completion-type contract, with three separate Phases, for this procurement.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about January 10, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP-NIH-NICHD-2006-03. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by telephone to Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at (301) 435-6960.

The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  The Government also reserves the right to cancel this procurement at any time prior to contract award.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Next Generation Sensor Concepts.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments. The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys. Upgrades to existing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed. Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar. These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions. Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas. Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense. Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

Multi-Intelligence Sensor Technology (MIST).  AFRL Rome Research Site is also soliciting white papers that address the design, development, and execution of a multi-function, multi-mission demonstration involving an X-band radar, UHF radar, and an ESM system installed on an airborne test bed.  At a minimum, the MIST should demonstrate real time sensor control of the following functions: UHF radar performing AMTI search and coarse tracking of airborne targets, X-band radar performing high accuracy tracking of airborne targets handed over by the UHF system via the sensor controller, X-band radar detecting and tracking ground moving targets, SAR imaging of stationary targets using X-band radar, the geo-location of ground targets by the X-Band radar based on a cue from the ESM system (RF emission from ground target) via the sensor controller, and the collection of sensor data to support automatic target cuing (ATC) and automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithm development/evaluation.  Demonstration of additional capabilities, including true simultaneous SAR-GMTI and Combat ID, are also of interest.  The technical point of contact for the MIST topic area is Dr. Jeff Carlo, AFRL/SNRD, 315-330-7839.

TITLE: Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) Standard Reference Frame

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #06-09-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 15 January 06; FY 07 by 1 May 06 and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 September 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that investigate tools, techniques and technologies that facilitate cost-effective harvesting, migration or replacement of legacy systems to achieve net-centricity. This BAA presents a framework and methodology for linking the architecture views (based on the views from the DoD Architecture Framework v1.0 [DODAF]) and requirements within a toolsuite. This methodology is currently being used to support the Joint DoD software development project for an Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM). Within this methodology, the DoD AF is used as a systems engineering tool, bridging the operational-to-system-to-software architecture gaps which are much of the source of interoperability difficulties today. The desired efforts will also design and perform incremental Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM) demonstrations leading to Joint system of systems demonstration. 

    (1) SIAP Standardization:  The Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), will become a networking tool intended to endow commanders, pilots and even infantrymen with a single tactical picture of the battlespace, showing friendly and enemy units on land, sea and in the air.  SIAP is seen as a principal means of networking forces together to create a decisive warfighting advantage. The Pentagon's Integrated Architecture Behavior Model, an element of SIAP, is a computer program designed to measure the adequacy and fidelity of information used to form a shared understanding of the tactical situation, according to an August 2003 report on SIAP attributes. The information developed from various military sensors would have to conform to common standards in order to create the SIAP. This standardization would enable the shooter in an F/A-18E/F tactical aircraft to use information from an Army air defense missile battery, for example. Or Aegis ships would be able to target their missiles using information obtained by an Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane. To achieve the SIAP would require that all sensors utilize a standard reference frame for conveying information about the location of targets. Systems won't be able to tell where the data came from, but it will be better, more accurate and less redundant. To achieve the SIAP would require that all sensors utilize a standard reference frame for conveying information about the location of targets. Specific areas of SIAP research/development that this BAA covers include: 

        a.  A Joint Service SIAP Systems Architecture for integrating and deploying SIAP applications among USAF and Joint Services.

b.	Advanced simulation technologies to assess and test emerging SIAP capabilities to achieve net-centricity.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $8M; FY 07 - $8M, and FY 08 - $8M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $4M to $20M per year.

Nagy, AFRL/IFED, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505.   Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA 06-09-IFKA.

Electronic submission to James.Nagy@rl.af.mil will also be accepted and is encouraged.  

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   
 

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secrete information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with I. Levy & Associates, 645 Maryville Centre Drive, Suite 200, St. Louis, MO 63141-5815 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development and implementation of the Electronic Folder Interface (EFI)/Document Management Architecture (DMA) software into 30 Levy supported DDS sites nationwide. The period of performance for this award will begin on 3/23/06 and continue through 3/22/07 with four one year option periods to extend the terms of the Contract.  Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs. These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs. I. Levy & Associates (ILA) developed and implemented the DDSs Disability Determination Case Processing System which is the legacy system used by each ILA supported state to process disability claims. ILA is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state. ILA has supported 30 DDSs for up to 20 years. ILA has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs. ILA owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve. The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise. One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder. The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases. To support the next and subsequent releases, modifications will be needed to the EFI/DMA and its supporting processes to enhance additional case processing. Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and JAVA applications utilizing the AS400 platform, process WebSphere Messaging Queues transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframe. The software must be 100% compatible with SSA’s current infrastructure. The Electronic Folder Interface (EFI) software must have the following conspicuous characteristics: The software must minimize modifications to the Electronic folder interface as well as the DDS legacy system application code when SSA changes the Electronic Folder’s data elements/requirements. The software must ensure user interfaces and screen presentations that exist in the DDS systems are preserved to the greatest extent possible when interfacing with eDib. Vendors authorized and capable of continuing SSA’s EFI development and implementation must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of business on January 4, 2006 and refer to SSA-RFQ-06-1022. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with Versa Management Systems, Inc., 110 North Kenilworth Avenue-7A, Oak Park, Illinois 60304 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “ Only one responsible source and no other source will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development and implementation of the Electronic Folder (EF) generic interface and Document Management Architecture (DMA) interface for a disability system operating in a DDS using licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems, Inc (Versa) into 17 supported Versa DDS sites. The period of performance for this award will begin on 3/24/06 and continue through 3/23/07 with four one year option periods to extend the terms of the Contract.  Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs. These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs. SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program. Versa developed and implemented the DDSs Case Processing System changes by utilizing COBOL, JAVA and XML languages on an AS/400 platform. In addition Versa has worked with the current SSA infrastructure, which consists of IWS/LAN, WebSphere Messaging Queues, IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes. Versa is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state. Versa has provided some form of DDS support for 18 years and has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs. Versa owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve. The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise. One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder. The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases. To support the next and any subsequent releases of eDib, modifications will be needed to the Versa EFI/DMA interface software and its supporting processes. The modifications will allow the DDS software systems to receive additional data elements from SSA’s Electronic Folder. The new data from SSA will provide additional case processing and update capabilities required to process disability cases after initial establishment. These modifications must be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional Versa states. The modifications must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems. Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and JAVA applications utilizing the AS400 platform, process WebSphere Messaging Queues transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes. Vendors authorized and capable of continuing SSA’s EFI development and implementation must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of business on January 4, 2006 and refer to SSA-RFP-06-1023. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W911QY-06-R-0003

<ARCHDATE>05022006
<CONTACT>Peggy Dube, (508) 233-4481
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (USA RDECOM) Natick Contracting Division (NCD), has a requirement on behalf of PM-CIE, to continue with the novel acqusition concept for the supply chain integration/management of various com ponents of the new Army Combat Uniform (ACU) Ensemble.  The ACU Emsemble components to be managed under this effort are the ACU coat, ACU trousers, ACU  Patrol Cap and ACU Sun Hat.  This procurement is a Full and Open Competitive acquisition. The governmen t has previously awarded contracts to demonstrate this concept, however, there wasnt enough data collected during the duration to make a determination.  Therefore, a new procurement is being solicited.  The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Pri ce contract(s) with a period of performance of approximately five months (from date of award through 30 Sept 2006).  The traditional approach of procuring garments for the military is challenging to both the Government (Army) and Industry.  The Army faces the challenge of having the right quantity of garments, by size, at the right time to meet Soldier demands.  Demand requirements are not constant, and given the current world situation with troops deploying in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), dema nd levels are even more unstable.  Additional constratints in availability of funding and Governmental regulatory and statutory procedures exacerbate the Armys challenge.  Industry is faced with the challenge of forecasting demand against this extremely d ynamic environment.  As the Armys demand requirements continuously change, industry is faced with rapid changes to production.  The impact of demand changes increase as they travel down the supply chain.  This bullwhip effect results in stops and starts  in production, and these stops and starts affect quality.  Given these challenges and constraints, this demonstration project intends to address the issues on a small scale using selected components of the new ACU.  This project will require successor off eror(s) to establish and maintain a continuous flow of product at least one (up to three) supply chains for a delivery period specifiedc by the contractor(s) while fielding the ACU to as many deploying troops as possible.  Interested sources must have expe rience in manufacturing end items or materials used in the current Army Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) or ACU.  The Government highly encourages souces to team with members of the supply chain for this continuing demonstration project and will consider any mem ber of the supply chain (garment manufacturer, dying & finishing manufacturer, greige good manufacture or yar manufacturer) to be the lead (prime) contractor.  Multiple contracts are anticipated as follows:  up to 3 contracts (awarded on a full and open co mpetitive basis) to contractor team(s) (1) to demonstrate a novel approach to supply chain management and (2) to produce and deliver selected components of the ACU.  The government currently has a contract in place with Clemson Apparel Research (CAR).  CAR  has developed advanced supply chain management concetps as part of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Apparel Research Network (ARN) MANTECH project.  CAR will coordinate the supply chain by maintaining total asset visibility and providing synchronized re plenishment order, shipping and manufacturing recommendations based on the supply chain concepts and tools developed for the DLA ARN program.  This novel acquisition concept is intended to demonstrate total supply chain management from raw materials to fin ished garment delivery.  The goal of this demonstration is to reduce both cost and schedule, while increasing quality through leveling the production flow throughout the supply chain.  The Army has set aside $9M for this continuing demonstration project, s ubject to any unforseen funding constraints.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 315211; small business size standard  is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that the ACU Solicitation, RFP W911QY-06-R-0003, will be posted to the USA RDECOM-NCD website at https://www3.natick.army.mil on or about 31 January 2006  with an estimated closing date of 3 March 2006.  This acquisiti on is being conducted under the guidance of FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates making multiple contract awards (no more than three) for this acquisition, however, the Government reserves the right to award one or none.  In accordance with FAR Part 5. 102 all documents associated with this acquisition will be released via the USA RDECOM NCD webpage at https://www3.natick.army.mil .  No hard copies will be provided.  Any questions shall be addressed to Peggy Dube via email at peggy.dube@natick.army.mil a nd Darlene Rideout at darlene.rideout@natick.army.mil.  Telephone inquires will not be accepted.  Firms shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation.

5.	The Performance Work Statement mentions, “Staffing requirements are provided in Appendix 6.”  I cannot find Appendix 6 in the RFQ, please provide.
See amendment 2 to Medical Coder Solicitation posted on 15 Dec 05.

6.	I cannot find anywhere in the RFQ that details what the contractor is required to send back to your office in our quotation.  Are you just looking for our price or are you also requiring a technical response?  
See Solicitation FA4610-6-T-0008 posted on 13 Dec 05, Form 1449, 28 block, Item Number 0001 Net Amount, Review Clauses.  Please refer to FAR 52.212-1.  See also amendments to solicitation.
No technical response is solicited.

Please provide the estimated number of encounters to be performed either on a monthly or yearly basis.  The clinic has approximately 3,200 encounters per month.  A minimum of 30% of total visits/encounters will need to be audited per month achieving a minimum of 97% coding accuracy.   Please refer to Section 1 para 1.5.2.

12.	I would like to know if a layout is necessary for the quote such as technical and past performance
No technical or past performance were asked for per solicitation FA4610-6-T-0008.

13.	Would the government furnish the amount of encounters to be coded on this RFP.  I want to be able to bid an honest price, I do not want to under quote and I most certainly do not want to over quote.  The clinic has approximately 3,200 encounters per month.

In the RFQ the numbers of auditing was quoted on 123-per day, therefore I am only looking for the encounters number that will give me an idea for how many staff will be needed to fully implement this contract at 100%.  Please review the revised RFQ dated 15 Dec 05.  The clinic has approximately 3,200 encounters per month.  A minimum of 30% of total visits/encounters will need to be audited per month achieving a minimum of 97% coding accuracy.   Please refer to Section 1 para 1.5.2.

15.	Since no open bid will be conducted would the government consider a sole source negotiation?
No sole source will be considered, this solicitation is open competition for 100% Section 8(a) Set-Aside 

16	1.2.  Please clarify the process and what would be entailed with the review and analysis of the 180 encounters; also is coding involved with this?  The contractor will audit coding put into the Composite Health Care System by Provider.  Yes, some coding will be required.  Correction to errors made by Providers.

17.	1.2  Please clarify only needing one coder for 180 encounters per day?  A certain percent of Providers and clinic records will require auditing per day.  Please review Section 1 para 1.5.2.

18.	1.5.3 Please clarify quality expectation:
a.	In 1.2 it states 90%, and in 1.5.2 it states 95% and in 2.1.1 it states 90%.  Please refer to the Revised Statement of Work dated 15 Dec 05 para 1.5.2. and Section 2.
19.	1.6.9 Please clarify in this section and if you can provide an example of enhancing medical documentation?  Ie. Query process or clinical documentation improvements.  Provide training when errors are made to avoid incorrect coding in the future.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), is pleased to issue this solicitation for the FirstSource program.  This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. This final solicitation replaces the draft issued on August 9, 2005.
ITAC’s primary goal of the FirstSource acquisition is to establish a portfolio of IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department.  The FirstSource Program will support the DHS goal of promoting a functionally integrated Department with standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among the Department’s Components. DHS needs access to technological advances and new business practices as they occur that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHS’s Department-wide buying power to obtain lowest possible prices. 
The FirstSource Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractor’s commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. 
The method for accomplishing these objectives is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology, on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking, and associated services. The high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements. Specific equipment, delivery, and performance requirements will be defined in individual delivery orders that will be competed prior to their issuance.
The FirstSource procurement is a 100% Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code 541519; the business size standard is 150 employees. FirstSource is a complementary program to the EAGLE program.  EAGLE contractors may use FirstSource as a source for any equipment requirements in their task orders issued under EAGLE. The FirstSource procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts.  Contract term is a two-year base period with three one-year options. 
The Source Selection will be conducted using a best value analysis. Evaluation factors for award will emphasize price, technical and management solutions, and past performance. Offerors will be required to propose their published, commercial IT commodity catalogs for any or all of the required products. Prices for products included in the offeror’ catalogs will be based on the offeror’ proposed Dynamic Pricing Model (DPM). 
Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to DHS at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available dark fiber infrastructure between Capitol Hill and an Alternate Computing Facility within the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The United States House of Representatives (USHR or House) is soliciting industry for information related to dark fiber availability in the metropolitan area to enable future growth of communications between the primary and alternate data centers supporting the House. The focus of this solicitation is to provide House Communications and Business Continuity staff with a general understanding of dark fiber services that are available within the area, and the complexity of acquiring and activating dark fiber for future use. This information would serve as the foundation for a comprehensive and scalable solution that would be incorporated into the House Wide Area Network. The House is interested in obtaining information pertaining to but not limited to the following: 1. Current or proposed buried dark fiber infrastructure located within the metropolitan area. 2. Current capacity of buried dark fiber infrastructure. 3. Current or proposed route diversity of buried dark fiber infrastructure. 4. Current or proposed ownership of buried dark fiber and intermediate patch and co-location facilities. 5. Sampling of fiber loss standards for current or proposed buried dark fiber infrastructure and type of buried dark fiber. 6. Sampling of Service Level Agreements in place with existing users of buried fiber infrastructure including but not limited to maximum time to repair and credit criteria. 7. Sampling of Service Level Agreements in place with existing users of co-location facilities. 8. Method and procedures for allowing customer to monitor and troubleshoot assigned buried fiber plant. 9. Method, procedures and experience for supporting Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). 10. Method and procedures for provider monitoring of buried fiber plant. 11. List of currently supported customers and high level topology of network. 12. Rough order of magnitude (ROM) on pricing and availability via current government based contract (GSA/GWAC, etc.) USHR is located in downtown Washington, D.C. The facilities housing USHR consist of the United States Capitol, four main office buildings, and other smaller buildings clustered in an urban area encompassing an area of 0.8 square miles. The Alternate Computing Facility is located within the Metropolitan area; address information for this location will be provided under separate cover. Submittals should include examples of systems currently available to support the above specified operations, to include known locations where they are in use. Multiple systems may be proposed to meet the various needs specified, if appropriate. For currently available systems, proposals should include an estimate of lifecycle costs to include separate specification of purchase, implementation, and maintenance costs. New design efforts to meet the needs may be submitted; however, currently available systems are preferred. A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI. Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The USHR will not release any information – marked with a Proprietary legend – received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Legislative Branch of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Vendors may email their response no later than January 31, 2006 to jim.caskey@mail.house.gov; reference this RFI number and title in the subject line. Vendors may send hard copies to Office of Finance and Procurement, 356 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515; reference RFI number and title on shipping label, and send email to jim.caskey@mail.house.gov identifying carrier and tracking number for follow-up through mail/package screening. Vendors may direct technical questions to Mr. Rich Zanatta via email at richard.zanatta@mail.house.gov. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the House. The House is not responsible for the accuracy or timeliness of information republished by third parties. The email addresses provided are not intended for other use, “subscription,” or solicitation purposes; this is an express “opt-out” notice.  Note: Representatives of firms requiring additional information that may be confidential will be required to execute an Affirmation of Non-Disclosure which will be provided by the House upon request.

<DESC>Modified to correct response date only.  Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to license a method for sealing and staking of tube internals.  For non-structural process tubing internals, like porous metal filters used for gas distribution in hydride reactors, detailed mechanical design or special attachment details/methods are required to stake the internal component to the tube, and obtain a uniform seal between the tube inside diameter, and the component outside diameter.  Scientists at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a method that provides significant reduction in complexity of the internal attachment design by relying on the flash produced during inertial welding to form a seal between the internal component and tube, while also staking the internal in place.  Although tube internals may also be welded in place using conventional welding techniques, the heat associated with conventional welding could damage the internal, and shrinkage of weld filler material.  Any company interested in licensing this device must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice: John H. Olschon, telephone (803) 725-8125; fax: (803) 725-4988; email: john.olschon@srnl.doe.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #239, Aiken, SC  29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in licensing this invention only.

<DESC>Modified to correct response date only.  Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to license a Quick Disconnect Coupling with Magnetic Release.  Scientists at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a device that allows for quick assembly and disassembly of a mast or pole system.  The device is composed of a barbed male coupling and a female coupling with spring-loaded plungers and a magnetic “key” to disengage the couplings.  The barbed male inserts into the female causing the spring-loaded plungers to lock the couplings together.  A magnetic “key” is used to disengage the plungers from the male to allow release.  Any company interested in licensing this device must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice:  John H.

Provide evidence of meeting the following Key Performance Parameters when launched from US howitzer systems:" The conformed version is as stated below: The Market survey posted on 12/06/2005 is replaced with the following: MARKET SURVEY- EXCALIBUR BLOCK Ib SD&D TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a 24-36 month SD&D effort beginning in FY07 for the Block Ib objective unitary warhead variant of the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€, a 155mm artillery projectile. Initial award is anticipated in Early CY 2007. The Excalibur Program is for a Precision-Guided, 155mm projectile to deliver precise, lethal, cost effective fires at ranges of up to 35 km and greater. The 155mm Excalibur projectile will enable the maneuver commander to precisely defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral damage and unexploded ordnance. Excalibur performance will be largely dependant upon accurate target locating systems and sensors. This program supports the requirements of the US Army. It uses an incremental development approach with time-phased improvements in performance capabilities. The first unitary warhead, Block Ia- 1, began production in FY05 and is currently in production. The second unitary warhead, Block Ia-2, is in SD&D phase, and is expected to begin production in 1QFY07. The Block Ib objective unitary warhead variant will be a lower cost alternative to the Block Ia projectile with equivalent or improved accuracy, range and lethality. It is expected to begin SD&D phase in 2Q FY07. The draft performance specification PRF 12999870 is posted on ProcNet (http://procnet.pica.army.mil/dbi/DynCBD/SourcesSought.cfm) for your review and comment in response to this market survey.

For FY09 or FY10 deliveries, do you anticipate requiring any waivers or deviations from the performance specification? If so, provide a list. f. Does a complete technical data package exist for your round? g. Provide rough order magnitude estimated price per projectile in U.S. dollars for annual production quantities based on assumptions for both $50M and $100M of annual production funding amount for a 10 year period. h. Current /on-going development and test results for this round: 1. What is the current state of development or production? 2. What is the maximum rate of production using current or future facilities? 3. Provide evidence of capability of current production line for this or a similar munition. If current production line is not capable of production/delivery of estimated quantities for FY09 or FY10 and beyond, provide list of facilitization required with estimated price. 4.

<DESC>VISN 6, which encompasses the VA Medical Centers in Asheville, North Carolina; Beckley, West Virginia; Durham, North Carolina; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Hampton, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salem, Virginia and Salisbury, North Carolina is seeking potential sources to provide Repricing of Health Care Provider Invoices Services. The contractor will perform preferred pricing services.  This includes making healthcare provider discounts available to the VA and providing the preferred pricing information to the VA.  Pricing is based on a percentage of the savings; if there is no savings, there is no payment to the contractor.  The contractor’s fee is a percentage of savings on a per-claim basis with no additional fee beyond the percentage of sayings.  Savings are defined as the difference between the VA allowable (the amount the VA would pay) and the contractor’s preferred price.  When eligible veterans use providers offering discounts for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, or other services, discounted rates will be available to VAMC’s under this contract. All providers will submit their invoices to the individual VAMC in accordance with instructions.  The VAMC verifies eligibility, that the service is appropriate given the veterans eligibility, and determines the amount the VA will pay on a particular invoice.  The VAMC will document the amount VA will pay on the invoice and forward invoices greater than $150 to the contractor.  The contractor will verify the provider’s best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC.  The VAMC will select the lesser of the two prices for payment.  The contractor shall prepare an individual pricing form for every invoice and return it to the VAMC with the discounted price clearly written on it.  The contractor will pay for overnight or second-day shipping when it is used.  The contractor will provide the capability to exchange invoices electronically using HIPAA-compliant transactions.  This capability may or may not be exercised by the Government, which will be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  The applicable NAICS Code is 524291 with a size standard of $6 Million. Contract period will be one year from date of award with two available one-year option periods. No formal solicitation document exists at this time. Responses to this notice should include the following: name and address of company/provider; business size; socio-economic category, if any; firm’s experience in providing and capability of expeditiously providing Repricing of Health Care Invoices Services and any other pertinent information which demonstrates firm’s ability to meet the above requirement. All responses shall be submitted in writing no later than noon, January 12, 2006, EST, to the attention of: Kathy L. Allen (90C), VAMC, 100 Emancipation Drive, Hampton, VA 23667. Fax number: 757 728-3132. E-mail address: kathy.allen1@med.va.gov. If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Kathy Allen at 757 728-3120.

The Engineering Field Activity Southeast (EFASE) is seeking U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business,  and/or Other Small Business sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform this proposed project. The proposed project is for  repairs to the Trident Refit Facility (TRF) at KingsBay, Georgia.  The facility consists of the Drydock cover/structure (Bldg 5035), the Drydock basin (Bldg 5044), and ancillary buildings (Bldgs 5145-5150).  The drydock cover structure (Bldg 5035) is a large, partially enclosed, metal clad structure composed of structural steel members.  It is 825 feet long by 236 feet at the base.  The facility also includes a 300-foot open lay down area to the north of the enclosed portion of the structure.  The frames are a truss-bent configuration, generally spaced at 25-foot intervals.  The roof girder is a 210-foot, 10-panel Pratt truss with a sloping top chord.  It is supported on each side by a vertical truss consisting of 2 main columns and a crane column.  These steel columns are supported on a concrete pedestal that rises 4 feet above the cope deck.  The ancillary buildings are masonry building with metal cladding.  The existing structural steel in building 5035 from an elevation of 33-feet (16 feet above the cope deck) has experienced corrosion damage.  This project requires the contractor to remove of all coatings on all structural framing members above Elevation 33’ to a SSPC SP 10 specification and to apply a new epoxy polyamide coating system.  In addition, corroded bolts, gusset plates, and pipe support rods shall be replaced.  The metal wall panels on all buildings shall be patched, lower flashing replaced, and the exterior wall panels shall be pressure-washed to SSPC SP 12 specification and coated per the 09900 specification.  Close construction coordination and management by the construction contractor of all work will be essential in order to fulfill the work restrictions required for the facility.  The project comes in two phases with completion days of 196 for phase 1 and 305 for phase 2.  The project must be completed by May 24, 2007.  The estimated cost range is between $10,000,000 - $13,950,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238320 with a Small Business Size Standard of $12 million.  Interested sources shall submit a maximum of 3 projects describing the following:   1) Past Experience: Describe completed projects that are similar in size and scope with the proposed project in the last five (5) years. For each of the completed contracts/projects submitted, provide the title; location; whether prime or subcontractor work; contract or subcontract value; type of contract; contract completion date; customer point of contact including phone number; brief description or scope of work for this project, self performed work, percentage of self-performed work;  and overall performance rating received.  2) Bonding capacity:  Provide surety’s name, your maximum bonding capacity per project, and your aggregate maximum bonding capacity.   3) Identify whether your firm is an SBA certified 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concern, or Other Small Business.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to obtain license rights to market and distribute the following software toolkit to commercial customers.  The software application allows a chemical process simulation to be divided across multiple computers.  This can be envisioned by treating the computers as separate unit operations or small groupings of unit operations.  The material transfers between these unit of operation sections become data transmissions over the computer network.  In this way, a chemical process can be segregated and simulated over a network of computational resources instead of being confined to a single computer.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice:  John H.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to license a method for sealing and staking of tube internals.  For non-structural process tubing internals, like porous metal filters used for gas distribution in hydride reactors, detailed mechanical design or special attachment details/methods are required to stake the internal component to the tube, and obtain a uniform seal between the tube inside diameter, and the component outside diameter.  Scientists at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a method that provides significant reduction in complexity of the internal attachment design by relying on the flash produced during inertial welding to form a seal between the internal component and tube, while also staking the internal in place.  Although tube internals may also be welded in place using conventional welding techniques, the heat associated with conventional welding could damage the internal, and shrinkage of weld filler material.  Any company interested in licensing this device must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice: John H.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services is providing notice of the recompetition of contract N01-AI-95388. This current contract it titled, “Sexually Transmitted Diseases Prevention - Primate Unit.” In this recompetition, the NIAID looks to further the development of topical microbicides aimed at the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through pre-clinical testing in nonhuman primates. Also, the contract will expand to include testing for topical microbicide efficacy against Trichomonas vaginalis, SIV/SHIV, and other sexually-transmitted infectious organisms as new animal models are developed and validated. This contract will aid the development of candidate topical microbicides and prepare them for clinical trials and eventual licensesure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The nonhuman primate animal models for STIs and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV/SHIV) infection represent a valuable paradigm for studying infection and disease, prevention strategies, and therapeutic interventions. This crucial, but limited, nonhuman primate model resource is reserved for: (1) studies that cannot be addressed in small animal models (parameters not feasible in small animals for prevention of sexual transmission); (2) topical microbicides or therapeutic prevention approaches where "proof of concept" in a primate model would provide critical information to stimulate further development and evaluation in clinical trials; and/or (3) testing of candidates that have proven most promising in small animal models, or candidates in an advanced stage of development that require further evaluation.

Safety and efficacy evaluation in nonhuman primates of topical microbicides represents one step in the product development pipeline. DMID and the NIAID Division of AIDS (DAIDS) support an integrated product development program with the goal of developing topical microbicides for the prevention of HIV and STIs.  Additional information on NIAIDs topical microbicide development program is provided in the following links: NIAID Topical Microbicide Strategic Plan - http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/topical_microplan.pdf; DMID/STI website - http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/; INTEGRATED PRECLINICAL/CLINICAL PROGRAM FOR TOPICAL MICROBICIDES - http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-03-137.html.  

The NIAID plans one (1) contract award for a term of seven (7) years on or about April 2, 2007.  Should your firm be a small business, you are invited to submit two (2) copies of a capability statement to the contract person at the contracting office address above. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE WITH NAICS CODE 541710 AND WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.

<DESC>Potential sources sought for the manufacture of Fins for 120mm Mortar Ammunition.  These Fins are made from 2024 Aluminum alloy, and are approximately 10" long and  4 Â¾" in diameter .  The Fins are typically made in two pieces - one piece is normally a hollow 8 bladed extrusion, and the other piece is a machined and drilled piece of tubing or bar stock.  These two pieces are then press fitted together to form the Fin.  These Fins are manufactured to stringent dimensional, quality assurance and performance requirements.  Delivery requirements of 5,000 -17,000 Fins per month will necessitate the use of high volume production equipment.  A 100% Hydrostatic Test at 600 Atmospheres is required, so equipment to perform this type of testing is also required.  Respondents must have the available skills, equipment, personnel and facilities to perform the necessary manufacturing and testing operations.  Government owned equipment is not available.  The respondee must demonstrate that they have the capability to satisfy the above requirements.  This announcement is for informational planning purposes only, and is not a RFP.  All responding sources must submit, at no cost,  their responses not later than 27 Jan 2006 to: Ms. Sheela Lopez , Department of the Army, U.S Army RDECOM - ARDEC, Attn: AMSRD-AQ-APC, Bldg 10, Picatinny, NJ  07606-5000

<CONTACT>Billy Lemley, (256) 955-4985
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD) Technical Operational Support Activity (TOSA), desires to contract for the necessary goods and services required to support the global Inte lligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technology mission area associated with DoD operations throughout the world.  Any resultant contract is anticipated to be a multiple award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) with firm fixed price  labor rates and cost reimbursable contract line items (CLINs) for materials and other direct costs. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (i.e., HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, woman-owned, or large business) relative to Nort h American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (size standard of 1,000 employees).  PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM ALL AREAS OF THE SCOPE O F WORK (SOW). At this time, the Government does not intend to award more than five (5) contracts.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to the specific number and/or types of se t-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, PROVIDED THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD. The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams.) In accordance with applicable federal acquisition regulation guidance, companies normally form a contractor team arrangement before submitting an offer.  However, subject to when the arrangement occurs in the acquisition process and resp onsible contracting officer approval, if needed, vendors may enter into an arrangement later in the acquisition process, to include after contract award. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to conduct market research and receive capability papers from interested businesses/teams.  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:  Capability papers should include the following information: size of company (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SB, SDVOSB, Veteran, all others), number of employees, relevant past performance on same/similar work, your company/team capability to do this type of work, and the firm's ability to manage a large indefinite/delivery indefinite/quantity con tract with the potential of multiple subcontractors.  Documentation and technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company/team possesses the necessary experience and expertise in the 18 services/eq uipment areas listed below to compete for this acquisition.  Interested firms should submit via e-mail and attach the capability statement (Microsoft Word format) within 21 calendar days after the date of this announcement to billy.lemley@smdc.army.mil (ti tle email:  TOSA and Global ISR Technial Operations  Support).  Capability papers should not exceed ten (10) 8 1/2 x 11 pages, font size not smaller than Times New Roman 10.  No pictures, charts or graphs shall be included. Any questions can be directed to Mr. Lemley.  If a solicitation is issued it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  The submission of  this information in response to this sources sought announcement is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Governme nt to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intend to award on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Capability papers should address that the contractor o r contractor team has the demonstrated ability to perform the entire task. The DoD Technical Operational Support Activity (TOSA) is a unique organization whose exclusive focus is on providing force personnel with needed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities to effectively combat unconventional and asym metric threats in the Contemporary Operational Environment (COE).  TOSA's span of influence reaches from the battlefield to the integration and deployment of cutting-edge technologies to provide a quick reaction response to fill gaps in ISR capabilities.

<SUBJECT>A--FUTURE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES
<DESC>NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center, on behalf of The National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC), is soliciting expressions of interest to complement our existing resources in order to strengthen the proposals to be submitted for future research.  The respondent should understand that initial contributions of resources will be at the expense of the provider.  However, this investment in time, personnel, and/or facilities may result in the award of peer-reviewed research in which the respondent would be a partner.  This will be the basis for establishing potential cooperative agreements between the NSSTC and the organization for the partnership endeavor. The NSSTC, headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, is a collaborative research and education initiative focused on selected key scientific disciplines.  It consists of researchers and resources from government, academia and industry collaborating in an environment that enables cutting edge basic and applied research and fosters education of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  It is a unique blending of people, facilities and tools to encourage advances in Earth Science, Space Science, Materials Science, Biotechnology, Advanced Optics Technology, Space Propulsion Physics, and Information Technology Systems.  An Engineering Organization provides support to all research centers.   NSSTC consists of a core partnership between NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Alabama Space Science and Technology Alliance (SSTA).  The SSTA is comprised of the research universities in the State of Alabama, with the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) acting as the host university for the SSTA.  Each core partner brings unique and valuable assets to NSSTC that are available for NSSTC use.  Each also brings the capability to enable growth and to manage the external environment to assure continued political and financial support for NSSTC.  This is a major strength in today’s highly competitive research world.  As a partnership of existing organizations, NSSTC goals and objectives will be intimately tied to the missions and plans of the partners. The research performed by NSSTC will cover the range of maturity from basic science through technology development to mission operations and data analysis. In appropriate disciplines, laboratory experiments, sounding rockets, balloons and aircraft are used as platforms for the investigations being pursued in addition to manned and unmanned spacecraft.    NSSTC will also establish research partnerships with academic institutions, government agencies and private industry when appropriate.  Again, the purpose is to benefit the research goals of each organization.  These partnerships will again be formed after mutual agreement of the executive authorities of each organization and will be executed through a Space Act Agreement or other appropriate mechanisms. The concept of the NSSTC is that of an integrated research center. Teams of researchers, each working at their own location or in a location as deemed most effective will conduct the research. For example, individual researchers may choose to perform portions of their work at another location to take advantage of special facility capabilities or to promote increased technical exchange. NSSTC will be implemented through seven research disciplines.  The research disciplines are broken into two types, Research Centers and Affiliated Technologies.  The Research Centers are the Space Science Research Center, Global Hydrology and Climate Center, and the Information Technology Research Center.  The affiliated technologies are Propulsion Physics, Material Science, Optics and Energy Technology, and Biotechnology.  The Engineering Support Organization supports the seven research disciplines.  A brief description of each follows: 1.	SPACE SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER The Space Science Research Center (SSRC) will consist of researchers in solar physics, astrophysics, astrobiology, and space plasma physics, and high-energy plasma physics. Major research areas include high-energy astrophysics (gamma and x-ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics) and solar-terrestrial physics (solar and space plasma physics and planetary atmospheres).  Primary customers for this unit will include NASA’s OSS (Structure and Evolution of the Universe, Origins, and Sun-Earth Connection themes), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Defense, National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy. 2.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) – High/Alternative Program Development
<DESC>(A) On 11 Jan 06 at 1:00 pm, interested parties are invited to attend an Industry Day Conference conducted by the government study program representatives to address the goals and contractual objectives of a candidate new space system to perform overhead non-imaging infra-red (ONIR) missions.  The purpose of this study is to assess alternative system concepts for new ONIR capabilities.  The government study is chartered to assess Wide Field Of View (WFOV) telescopes, which can view the entire earth from geo-synchronous altitude, and large format Focal Plane Arrays (FPA), capable of imaging the entire earth.  The study team is interested in gaining industry perspectives on both of these technologies either separately or as a combined system capability.  The study team is interested in gaining industry insights into any other system concepts or design trades relevant to performing current ONIR missions with reduced costs or with lower technical risk.  The results of the study are intended to support an acquisition program to be submitted to OSD/AT&L for approval in FY08 for a planned Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in FY15.  (B)  The study team will recommend which long-lead technology items should be initiated in FY06-07.  The team also is chartered to undertake system definition activities as a precursor to the Key Decision Point B (KDP-B) event in FY08.  (C) The contractors will receive briefings from the Government on 11 Jan 06 at 1:00 pm.  The contractors will be given an opportunity to brief the Government team for one hour during 25-26 Jan 06.  The government will accept white papers from industry on this topic at any time through 26 Jan 06.  The Government will conduct final briefings to industry subsequent to the evaluation of industry inputs.  (D) The schedule for the Industry Days Conference is as follows:  1) Registration 2) Study Lead Welcome 3) Study and overview 4) Question and Answer Session.  The conference will take place at Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA.  Seating is limited; therefore, each contractor will be limited to five (5) representatives.  The conference will be held at the SECRET level.  Parties planning to attend should email their reservations by close of business 9 Jan 06 to, Lt Nathan Mitchell at Nathan.mitchell@losangeles.af.mil or fax them to 310-363-2511.

<SUBJECT>R -- CO-SPONSORSHIP OF EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2006 NIDDK-SPONSORED SYMPOSIUM
<DESC>Following on the success of the 2003 NIDDK-sponsored scientific symposium on IC, NIDDK is convening a similar and updated symposium on IC in 2006, collaborating with appropriate voluntary organizations (“Cooperating Organizations”). 
 
BACKGROUND:  The NIDDK is pursuing multiple efforts to combat IC.  These include its IC Clinical Research Network and basic science to help further understanding of underlying causes and symptoms and thus speed new interventions. In fall 2004, the NIDDK initiated an IC Awareness Campaign to reach out to urologists and to increase general public awareness.  Its National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse is the primary distribution channel for outreach materials, which include information on therapeutic options for patients. 
 
Collaborating with appropriate voluntary organizations, an NIDDK-planned international scientific meeting for FY 2006 will focus on “Frontiers in Painful Bladder Syndrome and Interstitial Cystitis.” 
 
THE SYMPOSIUM:  The Symposium is an educational program directed toward scientists and clinicians, most specifically those working in the fields of urology, bladder physiology and women’s health.  It is intended to expand scientific awareness of interstitial cystitis and its treatments, to provide a forum for discussion of the definition and etiology of interstitial cystitis and painful bladder syndrome, and to exchange information and ideas on current and contemplated research on and treatments of the disease and its symptoms.

INDEPENDENTLY SPONSORED PORTIONS OF SYMPOSIUM:  With mutual agreement between a Cooperating Organization and the NIDDK, a Cooperating Organization may, as part of the meeting, sponsor specific activities, including but not limited to a reception, travel fellowships or support of designated speakers.  No NIDDK resources, including staff, may be used to develop, promote or otherwise support a portion of the event that is independently sponsored by the Cooperating Organization, although official announcements and brochures may contain factual references to the schedule of the entire event, including portions sponsored by the Cooperating Organization.

The names of all Cooperating Organizations will be included in announcements and agenda with equal prominence, in an alphabetical format and identical font and size to be approved by NIDDK.  Cooperating Organization may also be listed on the agenda of the Symposium in connection with factual recital of specific events sponsored by Cooperating Organization.  


DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYMPOSIUM: The NIDDK will determine the goals and scope of the programs for the Symposium.  The agenda for the Symposium is being developed and will be finalized with the assistance and advice of a Scientific Planning Committee led by a Chair selected by the NIDDK.  The selected Chair will be an internationally-recognized leader with extensive peer-reviewed scholarship on the topic of educational programs.

The Scientific Planning Committee will work with NIDDK to develop and finalize a proposed agenda that includes speakers, topics, format, etc.  The final agenda, format, venue and dates for the Symposium and its programs must be approved by the NIDDK prior to implementation, and is dependent upon funds available.  In all instances, NIDDK must abide by all legal restrictions on the use of Federal funds and all applicable appropriations law requirements.

The scientific members of the Scientific Planning Committee will be jointly selected by the Chair and the NIDDK staff, and are expected to have recognized scientific expertise in areas and disciplines to be discussed at the meeting.  The voting members of the Scientific Planning committee are the Chair, the scientific members and one voting member from NIDDK staff.

The Cooperating Organization may serve as a non-voting, ex-officio member of the Scientific Planning Committee.  

Requirements for Co-Sponsorship as a Cooperating Organization:  Criteria for partnership with non-profit organizations partnering with NIDDK have been established by the NIDDK Clearinghouses.  To be designated a Cooperating Organization for a NIDDK-sponsored meeting the organization must present documentation that it meets the following criteria:

	a.	Maintain non-profit status as either a patient advocacy organization, educational institution, or professional organization.

	b.	Exist physically (“bricks and mortar”) with a headquarters, letterhead stationary, website, etc.

	c.	Operate under a stated mission consistent with partnership of NIDDK.

	d.	Administer organizational, educational or outreach activities on a national or international scale.

	e.	Have an established board of directors or advisory group that includes independent board-certified medical experts.

To co-sponsor an event also sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, or any subcomponent of the Department, such as the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, Cooperating Organization must abide by the legal memorandum of August 8, 2002, entitled “Co-Sponsorship Guidance,” issued by the HHS Designated Agency Ethics Official, a copy of which is attached.  Inkeeping with that Guidance, Cooperating Organization represents that neither it nor a majority of its members:

1.	are seeking official action by the NIDDK;
1.	are doing business with or seek to do business with the NIDDK; nor 
2.	have interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the official duties of an employee of the NIDDK.


CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The NIDDK will use the information provided in the Cooperating Organization Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its considerations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Cooperating Organizations have the opportunity to provide information to the NIDDK through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:  1. The statement should provide specific details of the event or activities that the Cooperating Organization proposes to sponsor in connection with the Symposium.  2.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Broad Agency Annoucement (BAA) W9113M-05-0011.  This annoucement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Copy of the BAA may be acce ssed at www.smdc.army.mil (Select: Business/Broad Agency Annoucements).  1.  The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) Space Division, Technology Directorate, Huntsville, AL, announces interest in receiving research, development and technol ogy maturation proposals with technical and cost presentations.  Proposals submitted should include new ideas for advanced and innovative concepts as well as prototype hardware and software for current and emerging space science and technology.  The propos al categories below are based on the space operations mission areas: 	a. Space Force Enhancement: 1.  C4ISR across multiple echelons, 2.  Civil/commercial/foreign national space assets integration / interoperability, 3.  All weather early warning, 4. Explo itation of space based imagery, 5. Kill Assessment, 6. POS/NAV systems, 7. Integration with other Battlefield Systems, and 8. Space to Future Force interoperability;  b. Space Control: 1.  Space situational awareness, 2.  Software/system security, and 3.

Foreign subcontract participation will be at the unclassified level.  3. All r esponsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the SMDC Space Technology office.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit  proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these e ntities. 4. Contracts, grants, or assistance instruments may be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. Notice of the Broad Agency Announcement shall be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (fedbizopps.gov) and Federal Grant Opportunities (fedgrants.gov) websites. 5. In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that offerors first submit a summary white paper for preliminary c onsideration.  Summary white papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA through the expiration date of 21 December 2006.  White papers will be considered as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgment of receipt of white papers will not be made, and white papers will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in the strictest confidence.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in proposal preparation and review.  The SM DC Space Division, Technology Directorate, will ask only those offerors with promising white papers to submit full technical and cost proposals for formal evaluation.  The SMDC Space Division will notify offerors within six (6) months of white paper receip t if a full proposal is requested. White papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.  6. Formal BAA proposals may be submitted without submission and review of a white paper. Offerors are  encouraged to use the Summary White Paper process described above and may submit a formal proposal even if the government does not request it.  Issuance of the  BAA or any request for submission of a proposal does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs. PART I -  WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION 1.The summary white paper should, in summary, capture the proposed technical concept t ogether with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, operational implications, and its contribution to the USASMDC.

The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness. (2) Personnel Qualifications - Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and inst rumentation as required. (3) Research and Development Contribution - Potential contribution of the proposed research to USASMDC in the above technology areas. b. Management Area.  The quality of the offeror's proposed management approach will be evaluated using the following factors: (1) Overall Scheduling and Planning - The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. (2) Expenditure Control - The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. c. Cost Area: The cost area is comprised of two evaluation factors; cost realism and total evaluated probable cost.  The cost realism and total evaluated probable cost to the government of the proposed work will be evaluated using the followin g: a.  Cost Realism:  The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed.  Cost realism will be evaluated but not rated. b.  Total Evaluated Probable Cost :  The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. c. Relative importance of Evaluation Criteria : (1)  Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. (2)  Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  T he factors under the management area are of equal importance. (3) Cost: (a)  The cost area is a substantial evaluation factor, however, it is less important than each of the technical and management areas. (b) Cost realism is a very important consideration  in the evaluation of the technical and management areas.  Poor cost realism may result in a lower evaluation of the technical and management areas. 3. Selectio n of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, a vailability of funds, and program balance.  In some cases, the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to USASMDC goals. PART V - OTHER INFORMATION 1. The Government antic ipates making multiple awards. Issuance of the BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  Offerors will be notified of selection for award approximately 45-90 days after government receipt of the proposals.  The Government  reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals not selected for immediate funding may be considered for a period of 6 months. 2. Cost Plus Fixed Fee completion and/or level of effort contracts are expe cted to be awarded.  Contracts, grants, and other transaction awards will be considered.  For planning purposes, awards are anticipated from $100,000 to $10M for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months.  In addition to the b asic contract, up to four (4) options can be proposed which can be used for surge level of effort or to extend period of performance.  However, the total contract value for the basic and options cannot exceed $45M and the total period of performance for th e basic and options cannot exceed 72 months.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of final report.  3. Any necessary coordination of facility use will be performed by the offeror.  4. The number and types of reports will be speci fied in the award document. However, the following are the titles, data item description (DID) numbers, and frequency of data items anticipated to be delivered during contract performance: (1)  STATUS REPORT, DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: Monthly/Quarterly; ( 2)  FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT DI-FNCL-80331, Submission: monthly; (3)  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL REPORTS SUMMARY DI-MISC-80048, Special Technical Report, Submission: As required by events; (4) OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) PLAN, One-time DI-MISC- 80508A (if required);  (5) SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN DI-IPSC-81427A (if required); (6) SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION DI-IPSC-81441A (if required); (7)  STATUS REPORT, FINAL REPORT DI-MISC-80048, Submission: One Time; and (8) STATUS REPORT, CONTRACT FUNDS DI-MGMT-81468, Submission: As Required. 5. Security Requirements:  While non-classified work is relevant, research at SMDC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This is not always known ahead of time, and when it does the applicant must be prepared to deal with classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended. 6.  Increasingly, the U.S. Government relies on sophisticated technology in its defense systems for effectivenes s in combat.  Technology is today's and will be tomorrow's force multiplier, and technology improves the warfighter's survivability.  It is prudent and practical to protect technologies deemed so critical that their exploitation will diminish or neutralize  a U.S. defense system's effectiveness.  Offerors may be required to develop a Technology Protection Plan in order to protect critical research technology (CRT) or critical program information (CPI).
