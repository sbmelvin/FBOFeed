<DESC>DESCRIPTION.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA-03-02-FH) con= stitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional informatio= n is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitatio= n regarding this notice be issued, requests for the same will be disregarde= d.=20 INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquis= ition Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the=  contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and D= evelopment Activity (ARDA), is issuing a BAA to solicit research proposals = addressing innovative solutions to mitigate the insider threat to Intellige= nce Community systems and networks.  Multiple awards are anticipated. Typic= al periods of performance for a base period will be 12 to 24 months, with t= he possibility of option years including final reports and/or demonstration= s. Individual awards for a base period are expected to be in the range of $= 500K to $750K with possible option year awards bringing the total to in exc= ess of one million ($1M) dollars.  Awards totaling up to five million dolla= rs ($5M) over two years are expected from this BAA.  ARDA intends to releas= e other BAA's in the future that will address related topics. Information i= n this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) that pr= ovides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, mul= tidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and sel= ection criteria.  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.g= ov/insider.cfm.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail= , or official mail.  Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interior, F= ort Huachuca by email to Gloria_M_Golden@nbc.gov or call 520-538-0411. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  The Advanced Research and Development Activity seeks i= nnovative solutions to mitigate the insider threat to Intelligence Communit= y systems and networks.   Defending against an insider who attempts to abus= e his computer privileges is one of the most critical problems facing the I= NFOSEC (Information Security) segment of the Intelligence Community (IC), b= ecause the damage that can be inflicted is potentially catastrophic.=20 ARDA defines insider threat as the potential damage to the interests of an = organization done by a person regarded as loyally working for or on behalf = of the organization.  The insider threat scope, in the context of this soli= citation, is limited to threats posed to assets within automated informatio= n systems (computer systems and their networks).  Within such a computing e= nvironment, an organization's interests can be embodied in both implicit an= d explicit security policies.  Therefore, insider threat can be more narrow= ly defined as the potential violation of system security policy by an autho= rized user.  Although policy violations can be the result of carelessness o= r accident, the core concern within this context is behavior driven by deli= berate and intended actions, e.g., malicious exploitation or destruction of=  data. The degree of sophistication of an insider can vary greatly, from novice to=  someone possessing significant skill and experience.  Similarly, the privi= leges that an insider can possess may range from those of a normal user to = powers of a system administrator applicable across most of a computing envi= ronment.  Note that this solicitation limits the definition of insider thre= at to human users.  It does not include malicious software that has made it= s way into an organization's network and systems, unless that software was = introduced by a member of the organization (the threatening "insider"). This BAA focuses on one aspect of the insider threat problem: document cont= rol.  We select this application domain to create focus and to highlight it= s particular importance and relevance to the Intelligence Community.  Such = focus will allow concentrated effort on a smaller part of a difficult probl= em and might allow specialized approaches that could be overlooked in a sea= rch for generic approaches to the insider threat problem. =20 =09 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:  Proposals are invited for innovative demonstrable docu= ment control solutions to mitigate the insider threat.  This solicitation s= eeks technologies that will advance the state of the art.  Commercial techn= ology may be leveraged wherever possible, but efforts that are largely engi= neering in nature or that represent incremental improvements to existing ca= pabilities will not be funded.  However, teaming arrangements formed betwee= n those with products or advanced prototypes and those in the research comm= unity are encouraged. =20 =09 Technologies sought under this solicitation must be highly resistant to sub= version or circumvention by a sophisticated insider.  Respondents must demo= nstrate confidence in the effectiveness of their solution to resist attack = through assurance arguments that address techniques, processes, methodologi= es, etc. they have employed. =20 Regardless of specific technology employed, successful document control sol= utions will demonstrate several basic desirable features: =B7=09Ease of Use:  User interfaces should be easy to use and be free of in= ternal complexities.  Complexity in the user interface fosters disuse and/o= r potential security breaching work-arounds. =B7=09Operational Transparency:  Solutions should minimize the visibility o= f document protection and tracking mechanisms, thereby complicating user fo= rmulation of breaching strategies. =B7=09Portability:  Document protection should be effective across a broad = spectrum of platforms and technologies within the insider environment, e.g.= , XML-based web services, client-server, wireless environments, etc. =B7=09Agility:  Solutions should be capable of dynamically accommodating a = potentially fast-changing security environment, including changes to threat=  conditions, mission imperatives and personnel status. =20 =B7=09Self-Protection: Although ARDA recognizes the inherent security inter= dependencies among various system components (applications, services, kerne= l-level processing, etc.), solutions should be as self-protecting as possib= le to minimize their dependency on external components. ARDA understands that applications such as document control rest on infrast= ructures that include middleware, operating systems, hardware devices and n= etwork services.  In turn, the assurance arguments for the viability of any=  approach for the application domain rest on the assurance argument for the=  properties of the underlying infrastructure.  While this solicitation is n= ot interested in general research on infrastructure security mechanisms, we=  do seek advancement in infrastructure mechanisms that support the preventi= on, detection, and recovery from attacks against the document control syste= m application and the underlying system supporting that document control sy= stem. =20 TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREAS:  This BAA solicits proposals in three topic a= reas:  (1) Trustworthy Document Control, (2) Infrastructure Support and (3)=  Modeling the Insider.  Proposals that address topic areas outside the thre= e, listed below, will be considered, but must address the basic concerns fo= r document control to mitigate insider threat as articulated in this BAA.  = Proposals unresponsive to these areas of interest will not be fully evaluat= ed.  A brief description of each research area is as follows: 1.  Trustworthy Document Control:  ARDA seeks research that culminates in t= he creation of a document control system with the following properties: =20 =B7=09Originator Control:  Document transactions can be controlled at all t= imes by its originator.  In this context "originator" is defined as an indi= vidual or group of individuals who owns a document and is authorized to est= ablish or modify document permissions.   Note that neither possession nor c= reation of a document implies ownership.  Document transactions can include=  read, write, modify, open, print, copy, distribute and destruct.  Other de= sired capabilities include, but are not limited to:  document self-destruct= ion, transaction limits (e.g., self-destruct after one read), man-in-the-lo= op (semi-automatic) capability for selected transactions. =B7=09Audit and Tracking:  Evidence of any document transaction, both succe= ssful and unsuccessful, must be recorded to the granularity of individual u= sers and document instances.  Capabilities will also support real time audi= t, post-compromise forensic analysis, and the status of a specific document=  of interest, e.g., number and location of document instances, current perm= ission set, number and type of transactions, etc. Component technologies that would be used to produce such a document contro= l system, such as cryptographic subsystems, are welcome as proposals, but i= ntegrated solutions are preferred.  Whether component or integrated system = is proposed, a convincing assurance argument must be made that the system w= ill achieve the protection properties sought.  Proposals will be judged not=  only on the basis of the claimed effectiveness of the technology and mecha= nisms created but also by the level of assurance that is claimed, through t= he assurance argument, to be achievable. 2.  Infrastructure Support:  ARDA seeks research into technology and mechan= isms that support the creation of protected applications such as the docume= nt control system described in the first part of the solicitation.  Mechani= sms that detect, prevent or recover from attacks on the application or the = infrastructure itself are sought.  We are particularly interested in reusab= le building block, assurable mechanisms that support the development of con= trolled applications that help thwart insider attacks.  Desired capabilitie= s include: =B7=09Tamper resistance of security controls and audit functions =B7=09Integrity of associated document processes, data, and metadata =B7=09Strong persistent authentication for all accesses (e.g., biometrics) =B7=09Ensuring least privilege in granting permissions =B7=09Policy translation techniques =B7=09Policy configurable design=20 =B7=09Dynamic updating of document permissions =B7=09Effective document removal (e.g., not physically recoverable once per= mission revoked) 3.  Modeling The Insider:  ARDA seeks models of insider behavior that captu= re both authorized and unauthorized activity. For example, such models shou= ld include techniques, processes, methodologies, etc. that have been employ= ed during previous attacks. Models should be able to rank potential risks, = given a value of each document that can be targeted by a given method. Thes= e models should combine such capabilities in a way that can assess likely t= arget documents and hypothesize opportunistic periods and/or scenarios for = compromise. Such a model should be extensible to allow addition of data and=  evaluation/modeling processes.  The models shall be constructed to be usef= ul to detect unauthorized activity and to predict the course of a multi-sta= ge attack so as to inform appropriate defensive actions. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  See the Proposer Information Pamphlet (= PIP) which provides preparation and submission instructions for proposals. =  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/insider.cfm PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM, Mountain Stan= dard Time, 1 Apr 2003 to the Department of the Interior, National Business = Center, Acquisition Support Division, Southwest Branch, Post Office Box 129= 24, ATTN: BAA (G. Golden), Fort Huachuca, Arizona, 85670-2924.  See the Pro= poser Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides detailed instructions on pr= oposal submission procedures.  It is available on the World Wide Web at htt= p://www.nbc.gov/insider.cfm. =20 PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION. Proposals will be selected through a tec= hnical/scientific/business decision process using the following criteria in=  descending order of importance: (1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibil= ity, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational a= pproach, and experimental approach.  If a proposal lacks overall scientific=  and/or technical merit, it will not be further considered for award. (2) The effort's potential contributions to the Intelligence Community's In= formation Security  (INFOSEC) efforts. =20 (3) Cost reasonableness and realism. (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques,=  or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving p= roposal objectives (5) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of key personnel (6) The offeror's record of present and past performance Awards under this BAA will be made to responsible offerors on the basis of = the evaluation criteria above and a BEST VALUE approach to the Government. =  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds.  Awards may take the = form of a procurement contract or other transaction, depending upon the nat= ure of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between partie= s, and other factors.  The Government reserves the right to 1) select for a= ward all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fun= d any award instrument.

<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, 412/386-6106, jaskolka@netl.doe.gov;Donna Jaskolka, Contract Specialist, 412-386-6106, jaskolka@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>Master Solicitation DE-PS26-03NT41739-0 entitled EE-OIT Mining Industry of the Future: Exploration and Mining Technology solicits applications for cost-shared research and development of technologies that will reduce energy consumption, enhance economic competitiveness and reduce environmental impacts of the domestic mining industry. An efficient and productive mining industry requires constant progress in the processes and technologies used in exploration and mining.  While the mining industry uses many of the latest technologies to locate and mine materials, further process and technological advances are needed to enable enhanced and more efficient resource identification, characterization and production. The objective of the targeted solicitation is to support the stated national interests by funding R&D projects that address key industry-identified technology needs as described in the Exploration and Mining Technology Roadmap (Sept. 2002) (http://www.oit.doe.gov/mining/pdfs/emroadmap.pdf  )   and the Energy Analysis (http://www.oit.doe.gov/mining/pdfs/energyanalysis.pdf ). Applications under this solicitation are being sought in four interest areas: (1) Exploration and Mine Planning; (2) Underground Mining; (3) Surface Mining; and (4) Energy Intensive Processes.  Applications are sought for applied research at the bench-scale to field-scale level, for time periods of up to five years. AREA OF INTEREST 1 - DE-PS26-03NT41739-1:  EXPLORATION AND MINE PLANNING  - Exploration includes locating economic deposits and establishing their nature, shape and grade.  Activities involved in exploration include geological surveys, geophysical prospecting (both ground and aerial), boreholes and trail pits, surface/underground headings, drifts or tunnels.  Mining, as used here, is the extraction or removal of ore from surface or underground mines. This involves excavating activities such as digging, blasting, breaking, loading and hauling.   Interests include but are not limited to: prospecting, sampling, exploratory drilling such as rotary and percussive drilling, and other work involved in searching for ore. AREA OF INTEREST 2 - DE-PS26-03NT41739-2:  UNDERGROUND MINING  - Mining that takes place underground.  This type of mining is generally done where the valuable mineral is located deep enough where it is not economically viable to be removed by surface mining. Interests include but are not limited to: near face (such as intelligent or remote controlled robotics), ancillary (activities not directly involved in ore mining such as ventilation and improved health conditions) and maintenance operations and technical services are also of interest. AREA OF INTEREST 3 - DE-PS26-03NT41739-3:  SURFACE MINING  - Mining at or near the surface.  This type of mining is generally done where the overburden can be removed without too much expense.  Also called strip mining; placer mining; opencast; opencut mining; and/or open pit mining.  Interests include but are not limited to: solution mining, materials handling, systems integration and automation/robotics for all mining at or near the surface where overburden can be economically removed. AREA OF INTEREST 4 - DE-PS26-03NT41739-4:  ENERGY INTENSIVE PROCESSES - Materials handling, comminution, and pumping systems are highlighted as areas of special interest as they are considered to offer the potential for substantial energy savings in industry-wide applications.  The definitions used in the Energy Analysis for the different areas are as follows: (a) materials handling - any equipment or process used to transport ore and waste; and (b) extraction - any equipment or process used to search for and mine ore and waste. Awards will be cost-shared, financial assistance cooperative agreements, with a mandatory requirement that the recipient provide a minimum cost share of fifty percent (50%) of the total project costs.  It is anticipated that up to eight (8) projects will be selected for award.  Approximately $2,000,000 in federal funds are expected to be available in fiscal year 2004 to fund the first 12 months of performance for selected projects.  Subject to the availability of funds, approximately $6 - 10 million is planned to fund the remaining years of the projects. MULTI-PARTNER COLLABORATIONS ARE REQUIRED.  To be considered responsive to this solicitation, a proposal shall include, at the minimum, the involvement of either:  (a)  two "mining companies" (a "mining company" is defined as a firm actively engaged in the extraction and/or processing of rock or mineral resources for the purpose of producing a salable product(s)")   OR   (b) two companies, one of which must be a "mining" company and the other must be an equipment manufacturer/re-manufacturer or service provider to the mining industry, or mining technology developer or a mineral processing company if it's appropriate for facilitating the commercial process. THERE IS A MANDATORY, MINIMUM COST-SHARE REQUIREMENT OF FIFTY PERCENT (50%). APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED DIRECTLY BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER FEDERAL AGENCY, A FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (FFRDC) FUNDED BY ANOTHER AGENCY, OR A DOE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING CONTRACTOR (M&O)/DOE NATIONAL LABORATORY ARE INELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION under this solicitation, however, these entities may participate as  'team members' subject to the provisions set forth in the solicitation. Applicants must register with IIPS (https://e-center.doe.gov ) in order to submit an application.  If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the Help Desk at 1-800-683-0751 or e-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The solicitation will only be available through IIPS; no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation or related documents will be made available. Telephone requests, written requests, e-mail requests or facsimile requests for a copy of the solicitation package will not be accepted.  Applications must be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions and forms contained in the master solicitation.

<DESC>DESC: ******* The subject solicitation includes Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) building information.  For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requester must provide a signed copy of the Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors form and submit the following information: 1.) Copy of Business License, 2.) Company Dun and Bradstreet Number, 3.) Valid Tax Identification Number and 4.) Copy of Valid State Driver's License or State ID.  The form shall be submitted to the point of contact cited herein.  No e-mail copies will be accepted; however facsimiles will be accepted.  After verification of the preceding information, the requester will be designated as an authorized user and a hard copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Compact Disc (CD) of drawings will be released to the requester. *******  PROJECT SUMMARY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Design/Build services including, but not limited to the analysis, design and construction of the Exterior Masonry Renovation at the US Customs House Building, 610 South Canal, Chicago, Illinois. The range of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Funds are currently NOT Available for this project.
The objective of the Federal agencies would be to have the facility functioning and available to occupants at the time of renovation project considering budgetary and time constrains. GSA has divided the design/build process into two phases with a single solicitation to achieve the above goal. Step 1 would involve investigation and analysis of the failure of the predefined exterior facade. The resulting recommendations and design documents including drawings, specifications and construction schedule would form the base for Step 2. The Step 2, Construction Phase, will be negotiated and the contract price will be finalized based on unit price, extent of renovation, methodology and process recommended by the offeror and GSA. Source Selection Evaluation Factors. Final selection of the successful design builder will be made through the utilization of source selection procedures. Contract Award. Award of firm-fixed price contract will be based on the "best value trade-off" process (FAR 15). The ?Best Value Trade-off Process? is a method of evaluation price and factors other than cost of price. This method of evaluation has the objective of making trade-offs among cost or price and non-cost or non-price factors, permitting award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both technical factors and price, as specified in the RFP. The completion time for this project is 590 calendar days. Small Business. This solicitation is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Although this procurement is open to large business, small, small women-owned and minority businesses are strongly encouraged to participate. The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller businesses and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small business concerns, women-owned small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be approved and accepted prior to contract award. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned businesses. The North American Industry Classification System )NAICS) Code is 235950 for this project. Joint Ventures, Joint venture or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and must submit an acceptable joint venture agreement. 
The following factors comprise the Technical portion of the Proposal Evaluation: 1.) Past Performance. This factor considers design builders performance as a firm in providing comparable pre-construction and construction phase services for relevant projects in excess of $5 million. This factor will also be evaluated by the design builder's written responses to the RFP and by the evaluation of the references provided by the design builder. 2.) Key Personnel Qualifications. This factor considers design and construction experience and associated quality of design and construction work, education, background information, specific assignments of individuals proposed for this project. Include resumes of key team members for both the phases including, Project Managers for each phase, major consultants (eg. Masonry), Site Superintendent - 3.) Step 1-Cost of Investigating the Facade. This factor considers Design Builder?s ability to investigate, analyze, set up and present a detailed renovation/replacement plan of the facade including scaffolding, demolition, replacement costs. This should also include a detailed methodology and approach plan for step 1, specifying the technical challenges to be encountered and related skills of the key personal. 4.) Step 2 - Unit Prices. This factor considers the unit prices for the removal / replacement of the limestone / granite panels and management fees. Submittal Requirement. One (1) original and four (4) copies of the submittals should be prepared on standard 8 by 11 letter size papers, bound along the longer side, sealed in an envelope. INTERESTED PARTIES/HOW TO OFFER. Interested parties should submit a letter of interest to the attention of Dana Pionke, at GSA, Property Development (5PC), 230 South Dearborn Street, Room 3512, DPN 35-6, Chicago, Illinois 60604-1578.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Kimerly R Debois_sousa, Contract Specialis= t, 619-524-7186; Kimerly R Debois_sousa, Contracting Officer, 619-524-7186=
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) requests information from industry regarding SPAWAR's potential requirement for Fiber Optic Modem= s for the audio-visual (A-V) briefing and display infrastructure at the Nimitz-MacArthur Pacific Command Center. This potential requirement is = in reference to the Headquarters for the 21st Century (HQ21) project. This= announcement invites interested contractors to submit White Papers that= describe industry capabilities to meet this requirement and that provid= e rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) projections of the price of the potentia= l acquisition. The Nimitz-MacArthur Pacific Command Center is the new facility being b= uilt for the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (HQ USCINCPAC) at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii.  The HQ21 project involves the installation=  of all C4I systems into the new building - from SATCOM to secure video teleconferencing systems. The backbone of the audio-visual briefing and display infrastructure wi= ll be capable of transporting high quality, high resolution RGB video and aud= io between several spaces throughout the Command Center via fiber optics. =  The typical video signals will be computer generated RGBHV (red-green-blue video, with external horizontal and vertical sync) graphics at SXGA resolution= (1280x1024 pixels) at 60Hz and will be displayed on SXGA large screen displays at the receiving end points.  A-V sources will be shared between 14 spa= ces throughout the Command Center.  In the planned system, all source signa= ls will be transmitted from the 14 spaces via fiber optic modems to a common central site.  In the central site, the A-V signals from the fiber optic receiv= er modems will be routed with high-resolution RGBHV video and audio switch= ing equipment and retransmitted to the various spaces via fiber optics.  Th= e possible graphics detail of the video sources requires high quality distortion-free outputs at the far end receivers.  Currently known vide= o modems are multi-fiber analog (AM and FM) based and have been seen to produce = loss in video quality such as color convergence problems, color shifting, smear= ing, and edge blurring possibly due to the limitations of the technology.  The SPAWAR HQ21 Project is seeking a solution for a modem pair capable of transpor= ting detailed SXGA at 60Hz RGBHV graphics over fiber optics with minimal distortion as compared to the original signal.  It is approximated that initially = 80 pairs of these modems maybe used in the Command Center with the possibility o= f more in future expansion projects.  Potential solutions must meet the minimu= m requirements listed below: General =B7 A digital fiber transmission solution is desirable.  Analog solutio= n may be acceptable if devices meet all other requirements. RGB Video =B7 One-way video transmission. =B7 Auto-sense standard PC graphics resolutions up to and including a m= inimum of SXGA at 60Hz.  Graphics capability up to SXGA at 75Hz is optimum. =B7 External separate horizontal and vertical sync preferred but others= acceptable (i.e. RGsB, RGBS, RsGsBs). =B7 Capable of interfacing standard PC graphics adapters and standard S= XGA capable displays with 75Ohm termination. =B7 PC and monitor connection via 15pinHD or multiple BNC connectors.  = BNC connection preferred. Audio (optional, can be accomplished with separate devices) =B7 One-way, 1 or 2-channel line level in and out. =B7 20KHz frequency response per channel. Fiber Optics =B7 Multimode fiber using standard connectors (ST or SC) and wavelength= s. =B7 Single fiber desired.  Multiple fibers acceptable. =B7 Fiber lengths used in applications may be 6ft to 1000ft.  Multiple patches along fiber path possible.  Must tolerate optical fiber path loss up to= 10dB. Physical =B7 Standard 19inch rack mountable.  1RU height or multiple card cage t= ype configurations. =B7 Capable of 24/7 operations at 0 to 50 degrees Celsius. =B7 Must tolerate frequent power switching.  Modems may be powered off,=  via external controllable AC power devices, to shut off optics for far end access control of video signals.  Control signaling, such as RS232 or contact closure (preferred), will be used if available. =B7 Front panel power and optical link indication. Content of White Papers: White Papers shall be limited to ten (10) page= s and shall provide: 1. Information regarding the firm's ability to meet the requirement abo= ve. This information shall include the physical and functional descriptions of t= he modem, performance specifications (including quantity and type of fiber= s required), and production time. a. The Government is particularly interested in identifying if digital-based modems that meet its requirement are available in the market. If digital-based modems that meet its requirement are not available, the Government requ= ests that industry provide information on the estimated length of time and R= OM cost to develop such an item and the estimated ROM price of the item while i= n production.. 2. Information on whether the firm holds an exiting GSA Federal Supply Contract or other contractual vehicle that SPAWAR may utilize to procure this potential requirement. 3. ROM projections of price for the potential requirement. 4. Administrative Information:  (a) name and address of firm; (b) avera= ge annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (c) busine= ss type/ownership, indicating whether: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran-Owned Business; (d) number of year= s in business; (e) two company points of contact, including: name, title, ph= one, fax, and e-mail address; (f) DUNS Number (if available); (g) a list of customers for similar items sold during the past five years, including = a summary of the item sold, contract number, contract type, dollar value = for each contract referenced, and a customer point of contact with phone number.= At a later date, the Government may request submission of product sampl= es from industry to confirm qualitative characteristics. This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes o= nly and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a= solicitation announcement for proposals or quotes and no contract/order= will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any c= osts associated with providing information in response to this announcement,=  or in response to any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be= notified of the results of the Government's evaluation of White Papers.=  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside, a= HUBZone set-aside or an 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. Therefore any= response should indicate the status of your company.  White Papers in response to this announcement must by submitted by 15 November 2002 via e-mail t= o Ms. Kim DeBois Sousa, Contract Negotiator, at kimerly.debois-sousa@navy.mil= .

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA desires industry participation in the Insensitive Munitions Technology Transfer Program (IMTTP).  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d) (2).  Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Responses from all responsible sources will be considered.  Historically Black College and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBzone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is 541710 with the small business size of 1000 employees.
Requirements:  Responses to this announcement are sought to develop an advanced technology base for Insensitive Munitions (IM) mitigation technologies aimed at mitigating the response of Integral Rocket Ramjet (IRR) air breathing systems to IM stimuli.  Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that the scope of the responses be limited to those systems that pertain to the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Time Critical Strike (TCS) goals.  For further information regarding the requirements of the responses to this BAA, contact Nathan Kielman, NAWCWD, 760-939-7147, KielmanNJ@navair.navy.mil .  Information regarding the IMTTP in general is available from Vicki Brady, NAWCWD, 760-939-7342, vicki.brady@navy.mil.  The Navy wishes to identify and explore innovative and new concepts, principles, or processes in the area of IM mitigation.  Proposed concepts and technologies can address all components of an IRR air breathing system or an individual component (case, propellant, insulation materials, port covers, nozzle, etc.).  Proposals can address only air launched tactical missile applications.  The proposed technologies should address the IMTTP goals of maturing technologies for the transition of IM mitigation technology to the fleet.  A fusion of technologies is desired for insertion into an IRR tactical missile air breathing system to be demonstrated through testing.  Individual proposals are desired in the following ranges: Total funding is estimated at $50,000 to $750,000 per award with a period of performance from 1 to 4 years.  
Instructions:  This BAA consists of one step, which requires full proposals. Full proposals shall consist of two separate sections, one for Technical and one for Cost.  Both of these sections shall identify the following: (1) BAA number N68936-03-R-0027, BAA title and date, title of proposal; (2) Organization name; (3) Other team members, if any, and type of business for each; (4) Technical points of contact (including phone, fax, and email information); (5) Administrative point of contact; and (6) include the offeror's project title.  Titles given to the proposals should be descriptive of the type of work they cover and not merely be a copy of this solicitation.  The technical portion of the full proposal should include the following: (1) A clear discussion of the concept and associated technologies being proposed, technical goals, approach, expected results, and an estimated time frame for project; (2) Description of past performance on similar efforts with dollar values, contacts, and contact phone numbers.  Past performance information shall also include cost/price performance information including those internal controls used to ensure the offeror did not exceed the cost/price.  If costs were exceeded or prices were adjusted, provide the reasons and state the systematic improvement actions taken and current controls now in place to prevent future recurrences; (3) Schedule and deliverables; (4) Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project (should not include any proprietary information to allow for incorporation into a contract award); and (5) Resumes of the principal investigator and other key personnel.  The cost portion of the proposal should fully segregate cost by cost category and should include the following cost items, if appropriate: direct labor, fringe benefits, indirect labor, materials, subcontract, travel and other direct costs, G&A, cost of money, and fixed fee.  Direct labor should show each individual labor category with associated hours and specific unburdened labor rate.  All indirect costs (including fringe, indirect labor, G&A, and COM) should show base amount and rate.  Details/explanation of all other cost items should be given in this section.  The cost section should be accompanied by a completed certification package entitled "Representations and Certifications for Contract".  The certification package can be obtained from Laurel Fletcher by email at laurel.fletcher@navy.mil .  A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all large businesses.  Contractors shall ensure that proposals submitted address all evaluation criteria stated within this BAA. The original and 2 copies of each proposal shall be submitted by 4 PM PST, April 10, 2003 to Commander, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Building 02483, Attn: L. Fletcher, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6100.  Any proposals received after this initial cutoff time may not be reviewed in the initial cycle of technical reviews.  Therefore, awards based on the proposals after the initial cutoff will be based on the available amount of funding.  The Government reserves the right to select for contract any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Responses to this announcement should be unclassified.  All proprietary portions of the proposal shall be clearly identified and will be treated with the strictest confidence.  Final closing date is June 30, 2003, 4 PM PST.
Evaluation Criteria:  A scientific and engineering evaluation will be conducted on all proposals received.  The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical aspects of the full proposals.  The evaluation shall consider technical aspects and cost as related to technical effort.    The technical evaluation area will be ranked as first priority in the evaluation.  The cost area, while considered substantial, will be second in priority.  The technical evaluation will be based on the following criteria.  Criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4 are of equal importance to each other in the technical area.    The technical criteria are: (1) Soundness of offeror's technical approach with regard to feasibility of the project, probability of the technology being a viable candidate for selection/application and transition into an operational tactical missile system, and understanding the scope of technical effort.  (2) Past performance as it relates to demonstrated past/present performance, delivery schedule performance, and cost/price performance.  (3) Relevance of the proposed effort toward potential contributions to the NAWCWPNS, WD mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to the achievement/demonstration of the goals of NAWCWPNS, WD efforts in the Insensitive Munitions Technology Transfer Program.    (4) Capability of the offeror to successfully accomplish the proposed effort, which includes the availability of necessary resources such as experienced and capable technical and management personnel, and the availability, from any source, of required laboratory, shop, and test facilities.  Organization and clarity of information are critical to all of the evaluation criteria for the full proposal.  Cost, which includes consideration of proposed budget and funding profiles, and cost elements as they relate to the technical effort are the second evaluation area.  The cost evaluation criterion consists of realism and reasonableness of proposed costs and the availability of funds. Availability of funds will limit the number and magnitude of concepts funded.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Anticipated type of contract to be rewarded is cost-plus-fixed fee.  Anticipated award dates range from June to September 2003.  Offerors should state their proposals will be valid for 180 days from submission.  This BAA is open for 126 days from the issuance date of this announcement and proposals will be given consideration during this period.  However, as stated previously, submission of proposals by the initial cutoff time will ensure technical review with consideration of current allotted funding profiles.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  The Navy reserves the right to amend this BAA to allow for subsequent submission dates for proposals.  This announcement constitutes the only published solicitation for this requirement.  A formal Request For Proposal (RFP) will not be issued.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Note: offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.  A copy of this BAA will be available on https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.

<CONTACT>Roberta Truax Contracting Officer 3032368931     Roberta_Truax@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Business Center intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, using the Commercial Item procedures to acquire Quarterly Updates for Mine and Mill Cost Estimation Data for use in Mining Claim Patent and Validity Examinations and Other Mineral Related Public Land Administration Actions.  Preparation of accurate and reliable cost estimates require a timely, precise, and dependable sources of cost information as a product that can be cited as regionally applicable and accepted by the mining industry.  The products available to estimate mine and mill cost data are "Mine and Mill Equipment" and "Mining Cost Services" guides, which include comprehensive quarterly updates.  These guides are typically used together to develop BLM mine and mill cost estimates, which are closely scrutinized by Congress, the Secretary of the Interior, the Office of Inspector General, and environmental groups.  The mining and milling cost data, obtained by BLM, must be a compilation of information that is industry recognized as a reliable cost data source.  Industry data along with proprietary data must be compiled into a useful format, which includes but not limited to, information from railroads, electric companies, rural cooperatives, propane suppliers, State tax board, trucking and freight, labor unions, metal smelter and refiners, heavy equipment suppliers, manufacturer or importer of mining equipment, North American supplier of explosives and detonators, and suppliers of milling and reagents and equipment.  Western Mine Engineering compiles proprietary data from large and small mining companies along with maintaining trade secrets to produce industry-recognized cost data.  For nearly 20 years, BLM has used mining and milling cost information complied by Western Mine Engineering.  Their products have been widely used as the industry standard by federal, state, and private organizations with interest in mining and milling data.  No request for proposals (RFP) will be issued and no response will be made to letter or telephone requests for a copy of a solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is set aside for small business and the NAICS Code 514199 applies.  Responsible firms are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  They must, however, provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed that total intended transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by March 27, 2003 to the effect that a comparable source exists, a contract will be placed with Western Mine Engineering, Inc., for the requirements stated herein.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solcitation includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-12.  The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and is restricted to small businesses pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis (LCRC), as well as several other laboratories require the use of an in vivo fluorescence and low light luminescence imaging system using a Hamamatsu ORCA-II charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and Improvision Openlab software brand name or equal.  The LCRC goals in using the ORCA-II CCD Camera are to track: 1) tumor growth over time in various murine tumor models by measuring luminescence or fluorescence as a marker for tumor burden; 2) blood vessel growth and regression using transgenic mice expressing fluorescence or luminescence reporters in tumor endothelium or through compounds that target tumor endothelium; 3) localization and monitor expression levels of gene products after administration of various gene therapy vectors.  The process of In vivo fluorescence and luminescence imaging is emerging as a powerful tool in molecular imaging, while several major medical centers have developed the technology of measuring either fluorescence or luminescence but, not both modalities as two different types of CCD cameras are required.  The LCRC is interested in the discovery and evaluation of novel cancer therapeutics, primarily targeting angiogenesis and metastases.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  

THE TECHNOLOGY:  This technology is a process wherein sulfide production by bacteria is efficiently turned on and off, using pH adjustment.  The adjustment of pH impacts sulfide production by bacteria by altering the relative amounts of H2S and HS? in solution and thereby control the inhibition of the bacterial metabolism that produces sulfide.  This process can be used to make a bioreactor produce sulfide "on-demand" so that the production of sulfide can be matched to its use as a metal precipitation reagent.  The present invention is of significance because it enables the use of a biological reactor, a cost effective sulfide production system, by making the biological reactor produce hydrogen sulfide "on demand", and therefore responsive to production schedules, waste stream generation rate, and health and safety requirements/goals.  Please see US Pat No 6,387,669.

NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>DSCC is soliciting for an Automotive Prime Vendor (Worldwide.)  These parts will be used by the U.S. Armed Forces.  

Our goal will be to provide worldwide logistics support for automotive-type items.  A Prime Vendor (PV) will be awarded the contract to provide 1) DLA non-stocked NSNs, 2) price listed and 3) non-price listed CAGE and P/N items.  There will also be an unpriced feature, that allows for ordering items by CAGE and P/N (when not already priced).  

The PV will assume total supply chain management, which includes:  inventory management, distribution, parts acquisition and material forecasting.    The PV must possess the ability to source miscellaneous vehicular engine and power transmission equipment and to provide delivery based on requisition priority.  The PV will be required to interface directly with the military customer to provide both support of parts and method of support as the customers environment changes.  

The PV will be required to receive and transmit by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  The Government will transmit orders by EDI using conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines for the transfer of acquisition data and invoicing.  

The anticipated initial contract period will be for two years beginning on the date of award, with eight option years for a total of ten years.  

Access to the NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from http://dibbs.dscc.dla.mil/Rfp/ on the date of issue.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Award my not nece ssarily be made to the lowest priced offer.  Evaluation will be in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.  The following areas in descending order of importance will be evaluated:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Contrac tors shall visit Naticks web page at https://www3.natick.army.mil for a copy of the Request for Quotation.  No questions will be taken over the phone.  All questions must  be directed to Ms. Roberta Boswell, Contract Specialist, at Roberta.Boswell@natick .army.mil.  All quotations must be received (facsimile quotes will be accepted) via mail no later than 14 March 2003 at 3:30 p.m. local time.  All Department of Defense (DoD) procurement organizations were mandated to have a paperless contracting process i mplemented no later than 1 January 2000, per the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology).  Through innovative approaches this was accomplished, however, with the latest in technology improvement the Natick Contracting Division must continue to upgrade and improve its various automated systems and validate the total contracting process with each upgrade.   The introduction of the Command Commodity Standard System/ Procurement and Data Distribution System (CCSS/PADDS) and increased workforce in to the Natick Contracting Division mission required an integrated Systems Automation Team to manage the systems and functional requirements of the Acquisition Business Area.  As a result the services of a knowledgeable support contractor to supplement the Governments System Automation Acquisition operation has been identified.  The introduction of the Procurement Desktop Defense (PD2) also required additional systems management and functional requirements by the Systems Automation Team.  Additionally, the addition of Contract Automated Payment System (CAPS), Corps of Engineers Financial Management System (CEFMS), Electronic Data Access (EDA), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI), and Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) a s interfaces to PD2 also created additional systems management and functional requirements.  The Wholesale Logistics Modernization Program (WLMP) is scheduled for implementation at SBCCOM during late fiscal year (FY) 03 or early FY 04.  WLMP will replace C CSS and require establishment of interfaces from PADDS and eventually PD2 to the replacement system.  This will create major systems management and functional requirement changes, the requirement for training support to acquisition personnel, and technical  interface coordination.    SECURITY:  The Contractor shall provide security to a level necessary to meet the requirements of this  order.  The Contractors wor k effort shall not exceed a classification of SECRET.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  See Request for quotation.  LOCATION OF SERVICES:  The Contractor will be required to perform services as specified  on-site, at the Soldier Systems Center complex.  Due to the  high level of technical interface required between the Government and the Contractor, the Contractor personnel will be collocated with their Government counterparts.  PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY AND ORGANIZATION  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Contractor personnel are neither required nor authorized access to source selection or proprietary information as those terms are defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104-3).  Should technical assistance involving such information be required on a particular contract action, Contractor personnel will be barred from competing on the resulting contract.  See Note 1.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Discipline, National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) and the centers for Disease  control and Prevention laboratory in Colorado are collaborating on a 3-year project on the Geography and Pathways of the West Nile Virus in the United States.  In 2002, 5700 samples were collected from nearly 120 species from 14 sites in 12 states.  There are an additional 400 samples from 2001 to be analyzed.  The lack of adequate laboratory capability at the NWHC to complete the tests necessitates the acquisition of laboratory testing services elsewhere.  The sophisticated laboratory equipment and procedures requires the testing of these specimens to be performed by a certified biological safety level three facility.  The laboratory procedures require tissue culture production, experience in isolating and identifying viruses, newly developed serological tests, specialized reagents, and advanced molecular testing equipment and procedures.  A contractor with a certified biological safety level three facility is required.  THIS NOTICE IS SEEKING SOURCES.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.  If interested, respond to this notice by March 5, 2003, via e-mail mfritts@usgs.gov or fax to 703-648-7367 Attn:  M. Fritts.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The following is added to the synopsis dated February 14, 2003: F.  Milestones and Deliverables:	 	 	Submit QA Project Plan (March, 2003) 	 	Submit the draft approach (April, 2003)  	 	Submit the final approach (July, 2003) 	 	Submit the draft information on chemical  mixtures and available information (June, 2003) 	 	Submit the draft final report (July, 2003) 	 	Submit the final report and hard copies of all literature cited in the report (September, 2003) 	 	Deliver a professional quality seminar on the approach to the EPA in Cincinnati (September, 2003) G.   Quality Assurance: 	This project requires no calculation of existing data, regardless of its origin in the peer reviewed literature.  The contractor shall evaluate procedures previously published in the peer-reviewed literature (see references) and develop a comprehensive method comprised of the  various individual procedures previously developed, reviewed and published.  The contractor shall develop a justification for the application of the developed approach to the chemical mixtures (one specified), based on information publically available from EPA sources, and from the peer reviewed  literature.  All critical steps in the developed approach and information contained in the identification and justification for the chemical mixtures shall be clearly identified as to source, with the Contractor to place an emphasis on information available in the peer-reviewed literature.  The  description of the chemical mixtures shall include information on the metabolism, partition coefficients and pharmacokinetic information on components from the peer-reviewed literature.  Because information not from EPA public sources or the peer-reviewed literature will be the exception, rather  than the usual, any information not found from publically available EPA sources or from the peer-reviewed literature shall be additionally and uniquely identified (as simple as an asterisk and footnote) as having its origin not in the peer-reviewed literature.  All information shall be accurately  referenced. H.  Acceptance Criteria: 	The contractor shall provide by electronic submission: one copy of up to two separate files containing text and figures for the final report.  The report shall be titled, "Method of Analysis to Perform a Tissue-Based Cumulative Risk Assessment for Mixtures of  Chemicals" and shall be formatted in the manner usual for publication in the peer reviewed literature in accordance with the NCEA Instruction Manual for Contractors, March 2002 (attached).  The report shall present 1) a brief synopsis of guidance in US EPA (2000) and US EPA (2002), 2) the approach  organized in a step-wise manner and described in a straightforward fashion and with sufficient detail as to allow a reader only casually acquainted with the field of risk assessment but well-versed in toxicology and pharmacokinetics to understand the principles set forth in the report, but not  necessarily successfully implement the approach, and 3) descriptions of two chemical mixtures, containing specific information on metabolism and pharmacokinetics of each component, available in the peer-reviewed literature.  I.  Conflict of Interest 	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of  the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to a conflict of interest, as defined in FAR subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. 	The Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer  immediately, that to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the Contractor may have. 	The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential conflict of interest  is identified during the performance, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consulting with the Contracting Officer, to avoid,  mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest.  The Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary action to be taken. J.  Contract Publication Review Procedures (EPAAR 1552.237-70) (ARP 1984) 	The Contractor may not publish,  present briefings or release any material resulting directly or indirectly from work performed under this contract in any conference, presentation, forum, publication or other discussions without the prior approval of the EPA Project Officer.

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. The purpose of this modification is to add part 1 of attachment number 2 entitled "DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT, Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet." Part number 1 of Attachment number 2 follows:  

                                                                                            Attachment No. 2

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
	
	"Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet"

PART ONE (1)
 I.   BACKGROUND: 

	One of the primary goals of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is to make available to the public, full and complete information on NRC's activities to assist the public in making informed judgements regarding NRC activities.  The primary means of keeping the public informed about the regulatory activities and programs of the NRC is through the news media.  The NRC informs the media by:  issuing and posting on the Web news releases, speeches and fact sheets; distributing reports, decisions and other documents reflecting NRC actions; giving press conferences and talking with editorial boards of major newspapers around the country; responding to media questions after Commission meetings, staff meetings with licensees, plant visits, special inspections and other significant meetings; and talking to the media in person or by telephone.  

	Since March of 2000, NRC has offered the public, industry, and other NRC stakeholders access to monitoring Commission meetings over the Internet (webcasting). Under this initiative, designated Commission meetings are made available for remote access by Internet viewers "live" (as they take place) and/or "archived" (digital recordings of previously held meetings).  NRC currently obtains webcasting support described herein under an Interagency Agreement (IA) with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), IA number  NRC-10-02-144. 


II.   CONTRACT OBJECTIVE:

	The contractor shall provide experienced staff to support the creation and maintenance of the NRC webcast website and management of the technical aspects of NRC's webcasts.  The Contractor shall also provide the hardware, software, and telecommunication services to achieve complete and clear webcasting of NRC meetings via the Internet.  The contractor shall monitor all equipment remotely and  shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.


III.   SCOPE OF WORK:

	The contractor shall capture the audio and video content of Commission meetings from NRC's Commission Hearing Room audiovisual system, encode the content, and transmit the content to the contractor's technical infrastructure from which the Contractor shall make it available to the public, free of charge.  The contractor shall have a commitment to quality, customer service and providing the greatest number of viewers the fastest access possible to the NRC webcasts via the Internet. 

	The contract support shall include: (webpage development & maintenance, technical expertise, hardware, software, telecommunications services, Internet bandwidth, primary and backup servers, backup power, "viewing-software" user-Licenses, etc.) required to provide all interested parties with reliable access to NRC webcasts during the contract period.  

	The NRC estimates that a total of 40-meetings annually will be webcast "live", with an average length of support for each "live" webcast of 4-hours, including:
		A.  1-hour of pre-meeting testing the day before each webcast;
		B.  1-hour of pre-meeting testing the day of the webcast (just before the
		      start of the actual meeting);
		C.  2-hour usual duration of the actual meeting.    

	Upon completion of each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall add the webcast to the webcast webpage as an "archived" webcast, and provide viewers access to it on an   "on-demand" basis, 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, for up to 12-months.

	Occasionally, NRC will provide the Contractor a video (in either VHS, CD Rom or DVD format) of an NRC event that was not webcast "live" and require the Contractor to add  it to the list of archived webcasts on the webpage, for viewers to access on an 
	"on-demand" basis.


IV.    SPECIFIC TASKS:	The contractor shall accomplish the following tasks which are essential in webcasting NRC meetings over the Internet. 

Task-1		PROVIDE WEBCAST INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING   MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT: 

Requirement:	The contractor shall provide Internet webcast services (streaming audio/video) from NRC's Commission Hearing Room, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville MD 20852-2738, to a worldwide audience of Internet users (webcast viewers) from the contractor's servers.

		The contractor shall have the webcast system "fully operational" including completion of the installation, connection, configuration and testing of all infrastructure (hardware, software, technical support staffing, webcasting webpage creation, telecommunication lines, primary and backup servers, backup power, webcast viewing software user-Licenses, etc.) required to perform all requirements of the contract.  The contractor shall monitor the webcast system performance from the contractor's offsite location.


		To be "fully operational" the contractor's infrastructure shall:

		1.   Provide, concurrently with the actual meeting, viewer access to each NRC "live"  webcast without significant delays (more than 20-seconds between the events in the actual meeting and the webcast seen by Internet viewers).

  		2.  Have capacity to support up to one-hundred-thousand (100,000) "web-page-hits" per day.
	
		3.  Have capacity to support up to one-hundred (100) concurrent webcast viewers at 150kbps.
     
           		4.  Provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the equivalent software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website.
  
		5.  Not include any "gateway" or other type of advertising in order for the NRC webcast content to be accessed by any viewer without prejudice or the appearance of endorsement.

		6.  Include a connection to the NRC Headquarters videotape system in Rockville, Maryland to receive the "live" signal feed, encode the NRC webcast content and transmit it to the contractor's off-site webcast infrastructure.  

		7.  Enable all webcasts to be viewed at 150Kbps, 56Kbps and 28.8Kbps. 

		8.  Have capacity to concurrently support up to 120 archived webcasts during
		the contract period (each averaging 3-hours in duration).

		9.  Provide capability for webcast viewers to respond to the NRC's "viewer
 		survey".

		10.  Provide capability to collect and report data to NRC on the number of
		"unique" viewers that access the "live" and "archived" webcast version of 
		each meeting.

		11.  Provide capacity to host the NRC's webcast webpage.

		12.  Provide viewers with access to a webcast in which viewers can easily identify the participants at the meeting, understand the meeting's discussions, read the closed-caption text and any exhibits used during the meeting.  

		13.  The Contractor shall provide the NRC-PO with a toll-free telephone number and an e-mail address for the NRC-PO's use in placing orders to the Contractor for upcoming "test", "live" and "archived" webcast support services.

Date of Delivery:	Within 30-days of the date of contract award. 

Task-1.a.   NRC Measure: 	The Contractor shall provide the "fully operational" webcast infrastructure system within 30-days of the date of award. 
Task-1.a.   NRC Standard:	For initial acceptance of the system, the Contractor shall conduct a "test" webcast of an NRC meeting and any other tests necessary to clearly demonstrate to NRC the system's full compliance with the requirements stated herein in Task-1 for being "fully operational".  During the test webcast there shall be no interruption in the availability of the webcast to viewers.    
Task-1.a.   NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect the initial "test" webcast and also participate in testing the required system capacities and viewer feedback features that are required by NRC under Task-1, for the system to be "fully operational".


Task-1.b.  NRC Measure:	During each calendar-month period of the contract, the Contractor shall ensure the entire system is kept "fully operational" during each "test" and "live" webcast.
Task-1.b.  NRC Standard:	During "test' and "live" webcasts, the Contractor shall ensure the system continuously complies with all requirements for being  "fully operational".  No complaints shall be received from webcast viewers that the NRC-PO determines are a result of the system failing to be kept "fully operational".  No inspections by the NRC-PO shall reveal the system is not being kept "fully operational". 
Task-1.b.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each "test" and "live" webcast by monitoring the entire webcast via the Internet, in order to verify the entire system is kept "fully operational" and without interruptions in webcast access to viewers.  Further, the NRC-PO will investigate each complaint received from webcast viewers to determine if the complaint results from the webcast system failing to be "fully operational".


Task-1.c.  NRC Measure:	During each calendar-month period, the Contractor shall ensure that viewers:
					A.  Have access to the "archived" webcasts;
					B.  Are able to provide NRC with comments/questions
					     about NRC webcasts; and
					C.  Are able to respond to the NRC webcast survey.
				Further, the contractor shall collect data on webcast viewer
				activity, viewer survey responses and viewer comments and/or questions.  During these periods, the Contractor shall ensure that interruptions to the webcast system's status of being "fully operational" are kept to a minimum.  
Task-1.c.  NRC Standard:	During each calendar-day (24-hours), the Contractor shall ensure that viewers can access the archived webcasts, provide NRC with comments/questions about NRC webcasts and respond to the NRC survey during at least 23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.  Further, the Contractor shall ensure that interruptions to the webcast system's collection of  "unique viewer" activity data shall not exceed a total of 1-hour out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.  
Task-1.c.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will investigate any complaint received from webcast viewers to determine if the cause of the complaint is due to the contractor's webcast infrastructure failing to comply with the NRC requirements for being "fully operational".

Guidance:	None



Task-2		DEVELOP/HOST WEBPAGE AND PROVIDE
	           MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT:

Requirement:	Develop and host a webpage.  The  webpage shall be the host site for NRC webcast viewers to gain access to "live" and/or "archived" webcasts of NRC meetings via the Internet during the contract period.  To ensure compatibility and a consistent appearance and functionality of the Contractor ?s webcast webpage with NRC's other webpages, the Contractor shall use the current webcast webpage developed by NIH as the model for developing the new webcast webpage. (Visit www.nrc.gov. and click on "Live NRC Meeting Webcast and Webcast Archive.")
		
		To be "fully operational" the  webpage shall:

		1.   Be written in "standard HTML" that complies with section 508 of the  Rehabilitation Act (for specific guidance refer to http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm ), and have no "HTML-links" that begin with a "dot-slash" or "dot-dot-slash" (e.g. ./ or ../).
		  
		2.   Provide the user (webcast viewers) with a webpage (including URL address) that will provide dynamically-generated content as follows: 
			a.  During scheduled times when there is no webcast in progress, 
			     a message so indicating, displayed for several seconds followed 
			     by an automatic transfer back to the prior (NRC) webpage; 
			b.  During scheduled times when an NRC-originated webcast is in
			     progress, a message so indicating, displayed for several seconds 
			     followed by an automatic launch of the webcast URL and then a 
			     transfer back to the prior (NRC) webpage; 
			c.  In either case (a & b) above, the automated launch and transfers 
			    shall also be provided as ordinary HTML hyperlinks, for users with
			    browsers which do not process automated transfers.

		3.   Accurately identify all NRC meetings available for viewing including whether the meeting is an upcoming or current "live" webcast, or an "archive" version of a  previous meeting or webcast.  For each upcoming "live" webcast, the Contractor shall use information provided by the NRC-PO to notify viewers of the scheduled date, time and description of the meeting to be webcast.  

		4.   Allow any other Web-site to "link" to the NRC meeting webcast webpage without  any "charge" (cost).  Sites that could be expected to seek such a link are the major news organizations such as CNN, ABC news, MSNBC, etc.

		5.   The Contractor shall include in the webcast webpage an option for webcast viewers to voluntarily respond to the NRC's "viewer survey".  The Contractor shall collect the data from each response and provide it to the NRC/PO within 10 days after the end of each calendar-month.  The NRC reserves the right to determine what information is to be collected by the survey.  The current   survey provides the viewer an opportunity to express their level of interest in both "live" and "archived" meeting webcasts, and also lists various "viewer affiliation categories" that the viewer can select to identify their affiliation including:
		 A. Categories of viewer affiliation (such as licensee, utility, general public,
		     media, NRC staffer, federal/state/local official, public interest group, 
		     industry, international).
		 B. Level of viewer interest in having "live" NRC meetings available for Internet
		     access (categorized by very interested, interested, slightly interested, and 
		     no interest). 
		 C. Level of viewer interest in having "archived" NRC meetings available for
		     Internet access (categorized by very interested, interested, slightly 
		     interested, and no interest). 

		6.  The Contractor shall include in the webcast webpage an option for webcast viewers to submit  comments/questions on the NRC webcasting program.  The Contractor shall forward each viewer comment/question to the NRC at STREAMING@NRC.GOV, within 24-hours of its receipt. 

		7.  The Contractor shall ensure the webcast webpage never contains "inappropriate language or references" (offensive or intentionally misleading).

		8.  To establish the initial list of "archived" webcasts on the Contractor ?s new webcast webpage, the NRC-PO will provide the Contractor those previously archived webcasts that are still of interest to viewers and the Contractor shall add the previous NRC webcasts to the Contractor ?s new webcast webpage (provided to the Contractor by the NRC-PO in CD-Rom format from the list of archived webcasts on the NRC's current webcast webpage supported by NIH).

		9.  The webcast webpage shall only include the information provided by NRC.

		10. The webcast webpage shall be "fully operational" during all "live" webcasts and shall be fully operational at least 23-hours out of each 24-hours in a calendar-day during periods when "live" webcasts are not being webcast. 

Date of Delivery:      Within 30-days of the date of contract award. 

Task-2.a.  NRC Measure:	The Contractor shall provide a webcast webpage that meets all of the NRC's requirements within the specified delivery time.
Task-2.a.  NRC Standard:	The webpage complies with all NRC requirements. 
Task-2.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	Initially, the NRC-PO will inspect the webcast webpage upon notification by the Contractor of its completion, including inspecting the addition of the previous NRC webcasts that establishes the current "archived" webcast availability list.    During the contract period, the NRC-PO will inspect the webcast webpage prior to each "live" webcast and also after each webcast is added as an "archived" webcast.   Further, the NRC-PO will investigate any complaint received from viewers that the webpage is not "fully operational".

Guidance:	Upon award of the contract, NRC will provide the Contractor with a CD-ROM version of the previous NRC webcasts that NRC determines are still of interest to viewers and the Contractor shall add these previous webcasts to the new webcast webpage (approximately 30 3-hour webcasts).  NRC requires webcasts to remain available as an archived version until NRC is satisfied they have served their intended purpose (usually for 12-months after the "live" webcast of the meeting or the date the webcast was added to the webcast website, whichever was later).

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
	
	"Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet"

PART TWO (2) Continuation of SOW from Modification Number 1.

Task-3		PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR NRC "LIVE" WEBCASTS:

Requirement:	The contractor shall broadcast the NRC Commission meetings over the Internet as they take place.  For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text).   The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage.

		During each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall continuously monitor the webcast to ensure any disruptions in the availability of viewing-access to the webcast by Internet viewers are prevented.  In the event of a problem with the webcast infrastructure, the Contractor shall immediately respond to minimize the impact of the problem on the webcast viewers ability to access the NRC webcasts.

		If the NRC-PO requests, the contractor shall provide support to perform tests 
		of the webcast system at any time between 6:00am-6:00pm EST each weekday.  In addition, beginning one-hour prior to the actual scheduled start of an NRC meeting to be webcast "live", the contractor shall continuously test the webcast system infrastructure to ensure the system  is "fully operational" and ready to generate a high-quality webcast when the meeting begins.
  
Date of Delivery:	The contractor shall establish the capability to support NRC "live" webcasts within 30-days after contract award, and thereafter shall provide support for NRC "test" and "live" webcasts with 24-hours of advance notice from the NRC-PO.

Task-3.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall provide viewers with access to a high-quality webcast during each NRC "test" and "live" webcast.  
Task-3.a.  NRC Standard:	The contractor shall provide uninterrupted viewer access for   each NRC "test" and "live" webcast, when NRC provides at least 24-hours of advance notice.  The contractor shall prevent any interruption in the availability of the webcast to viewers or alteration of the webcast content received from NRC.  The Contractor shall ensure the webcast is optimized for Internet viewers video/audio clarity, including any adjustments needed to enhance the clarity of the closed-caption text.
Task-3.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each "test" and "live" webcast by monitoring the webcast via the Internet during the entire webcast.

Guidance:	NRC will determine which NRC meetings will be webcast "live" and/or which will be webcast as an "archived" version.  For each "live" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor with access to a "live" feed of the meeting from the NRC videotape system. 

		In the event of a disruption or unavailability of the NRC's "live" feed, NRC will provide the Contractor with a VHS tape of the meeting for use in adding the meeting to the webpage as an archived webcast.  

		As part of the pre-webcast setup before each "live" webcast, NRC reserves the right to schedule the Contractor to perform a "test" webcast (usually the day before each scheduled "live" webcast).  During the test webcast, the Contractor shall establish a separate URL-address for NRC personnel to view the test webcast via the Internet in order to verify that all systems are working at optimum levels, and if not, to allow time before the scheduled "live" webcast for the Contractor to make any necessary system adjustments.  Additionally, the day of each scheduled NRC "live" webcast, the Contractor shall participate in another similar test webcast, to enable NRC to provide a test feed to the Contractor as part of the setup for the actual "live" webcast, beginning 60-minutes before the scheduled start of the meeting.  This will enable NRC personnel to verify via the Internet that all systems are still working at optimum levels and ensure the connection carrying the "live" feed from NRC to the Contractor is working properly before the actual meeting begins. 


Task-4		PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR NRC "ARCHIVED" WEBCASTS:

Requirement:	Provide conversion of approximately 40 NRC "live" webcasts annually (each averaging 3-hours in duration) into an "archived" format to allow any user on   the Internet the ability to view previous NRC webcasts on a "on-demand" basis, 24-hours a day, 7-days-week, during the contract period. 

		Provide capacity to concurrently support up to 120 NRC archived webcasts during the contract  period (each averaging 3-hours in duration).

		The Contractor shall provide viewers with uninterrupted "on-demand" access to any meeting at any time during the contract.

		The Contractor shall add all NRC "live" webcasts to the webcast webpage within 24-hours after the "live" webcast's completion.   If NRC designates a meeting is to be converted into "archived" format on an "urgent" basis, the contractor shall complete the archival of the meeting and make it available for viewers to access within 4-hours after either the completion of the "live" webcast or the Contractor receiving a VHS-tape of the meeting from NRC.

		The contractor shall notify the NRC-PO by e-mail when each webcast has been successfully converted into an "archived" format and is ready for viewers to access from the webcast webpage. 

		As in the current NRC webcast webpage, archived webcasts shall be listed on the webpage in chronological order with the most recent webcast listed first.  

		Provide long-term archival of NRC webcasts consisting of transferring each meeting's webcast onto a Compact Disk (CD) after the conclusion of it's usual 12-month period of availability on the Webpage as an archived webcast, and delivery of the CD to the NRC-PO.

		While each webcast is available for viewing from the webcast Web Page, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of NRC and non-NRC "unique viewers" accessing the webcast during each calendar month that the meeting is available for "archived" viewing.
	
Date of Delivery:	The contractor shall establish the capability to convert NRC meetings into an archived format for "on-demand" viewing from the webcast webpage within 30-days after contract award.  All NRC "live" webcasts shall be converted and added to the webcast webpage's "archived" access within 24-hours of the "live" webcast's completion.  For "urgent" conversions into the "archived" access availability, the Contractor shall provide "archived" viewing access to the webcast within 4-hours after either the completion of the "live" webcast or the Contractor receiving a VHS-tape of a meeting and/or event from NRC (in case the meeting or event was not webcast "live" originally, or there was any interruption or disruption in the "live" feed from NRC).  

			Deliver an "archived" version of each webcast to the NRC-PO, stored in a CD-ROM format, within 30-calendar-days of the initial "live" webcast of the meeting.	

Task-4.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall convert all NRC "live" webcasts, and other NRC meetings designated for conversion by NRC, and make them available for "on-demand" viewing from the webcast webpage.
Task-4.a.  NRC Standard:	The Contractor shall convert meetings and make them available within the standard 24-hour time frame or the 4-hour "urgent" time frame, as designated by the NRC-PO.  Each "archived" webcast shall be available for uninterrupted "on-demand" viewing access for at least 23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.   
Task-4.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each archived webcast upon notification by the contractor of the completion of the meeting's conversion into "archived" format availability.  The NRC-PO will also investigate any complaints received from viewers regarding their inability to access any NRC "archived" webcast in order to determine whether the contractor failed to comply with the minimum 23-hour per calendar-day level of "on-demand" access availability required by NRC.

Guidance:	In the event of a disruption in the "live" webcast feed, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS-tape of the meeting for use in archiving the webcast.

		NRC will require most "live" webcasts to be converted to an "archived" version and added to the webcasting webpage within 24-hours of the actual meeting's conclusion.  Occasionally, NRC will require a "live" webcast or other NRC meeting to be converted to an "archived" format and added to the webcast webpage on an "urgent" basis  (within 4-hours of the Contractor receiving either the "live" feed of the webcast or a VHS tape of the meeting).    

		The NRC will determine the length of time each webcast is kept available for viewing from the webcast webpage.

		NOTE: NRC will provide the Contractor with an archived version of the previous NRC webcasts (approximately thirty (30) 3-hour meetings) in CD-ROM format  for inclusion in the new webcast webpage.  NRC requires webcasts to remain available as an archived version until NRC is satisfied they have served their intended purpose (usually for 12-months after the "live" webcast of the meeting or the date the webcast was added to the webcast website, whichever was later).

Task-5		NETWORK SECURITY

Requirement:	The contractor shall provide "Maximum Network Security" for NRC webcasts including submission of a "webcast security plan" to the NRC-PO within 2-weeks  of the date of award, which explains the methodology to be used by the contractor to consistently achieve it.  If upon NRC's review, a weakness is revealed in the Contractor ?s proposed "webcast security plan", the Contractor shall make the necessary adjustments required to mitigate the weakness.

Date of Delivery:	The Contractor shall provide a "webcast security plan" to the NRC-PO within 2-weeks after the date of award, and establish "Maximum Network Security" for the webcast infrastructure within 30-days after the date of contract award. 

Task-5.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall comply with the NRC requirement for "Maximum Network Security".
Task-5.a.  NRC Standard:	"Maximum Network Security" is achieved during the contract  period by:
					a.  Prevention of any interruption in the availability of NRC
					     "live" webcasts to Internet viewers; 
					b.  Prevention of any interruption in the availability of NRC
					     "archived" webcasts to Internet viewers, during at least
					     23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day,
					     and;
					c.  Prevention of any corruption or alteration of NRC
					     webcast data by unauthorized sources. 	
Task-5.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will coordinate an NRC review of the Contractor ?s "webcast security plan" and provide the Contractor any comments/questions and/or weaknesses found.  Further, the NRC-PO will inspect each "live" webcast during the webcast to verify the webcast is not interrupted, corrupted and/or altered in any way by unauthorized sources.  The NRC-PO will investigate any complaint from viewers that could be a result of the Contractor failing to maintain "Maximum Network Security", during the contract period. 

Guidance:	None


Task-6		DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING

Requirement:	During each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of NRC and non-NRC "unique viewers" who access the webcast during the meeting (the tracking of "unique viewers" does not count the same viewer more than once if they access the same "live" webcast multiple times) and provide the data to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of the conclusion of the webcast.
	  
		For each "archived" webcast, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of "unique viewers" accessing the webcast during each calendar-month period, and provide the data to the NRC-PO within 10-calendar-days after conclusion of the month. 

		For each e-mail response received from viewers with comments and/or questions on the NRC webcast program, the Contractor shall forward the viewer responses to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of receipt from the viewer.  
		
		For each viewer webcast survey response submitted, the Contractor shall forward the survey response to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of receipt from the viewer. 

Date of Delivery:	Provide the webcast viewer data and/or responses by e-mail to the   NRC-PO within the delivery-time specified above in Task-6, for each type of information.  

Task-6.a.  NRC Measure:	The Contractor shall accurately collect the viewer data/responses and forward them to the NRC-PO within the specified delivery-time. 

Task-6.a.  NRC Standard:	"Unique viewer" data provided to the NRC-PO shall accurately reflect the viewing audience of NRC webcasts.  All viewer questions, comments and survey responses received by the Contractor shall be forwarded to the NRC-PO within the designated time frame and complete. 
Task-6.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect all viewer data and viewer responses received from the Contractor. 



V.  	OVERALL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND DEDUCTION SCHEDULE:
	The following processes will be used by NRC to motivate successful performance of the contract requirements stated herein:

	Failure by the Contractor to comply with any of the procedures and/or contract requirements stated herein shall constitute a "valid-deficiency" under this contract, unless the failure can be shown to be caused by circumstances beyond the Contractor's control.  

	No more than one (1) contract-deficiency shall be allowed by NRC per calendar-month period, in which the NRC-PO determines the discrepancy is a "valid-deficiency" for   non-compliance with any Contract Requirements.                              

	The Contractor shall invoice monthly with a single invoice that includes a breakdown of the cost of all support provided during the previous calendar-month's period.  For any month in which the Contractor fails to comply with the contract requirements stated herein, NRC reserves the right to deduct the following amounts from that month's total monthly invoice payment:

		0-1	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in no deduction;
		   2	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 5% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   3	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 6% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   4	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 7% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   5	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 8% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   6	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 10% of the total monthly invoice being deducted.
		
	NOTE: Under the Performance Incentives listed above, NRC will not deduct more than a 
	            total of 10% from the monthly invoice.   	

	The deductions listed above do not prevent NRC from taking other appropriate actions to correct performance problems under this contract.


VI.    	MEETINGS AND TRAVEL: 
 	The contractor shall attend an initial meeting with the NRC staff within 3-workdays after the contract is awarded.  The meeting will take place at NRC headquarters to provide clarification of any questions, concerns and expectations.  

 
VII.     NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT:
 	The NRC will provide the contractor onsite access for initial installation setup and shall provide limited space and power connection for the contractor's equipment.  The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.


VIII.    RIGHTS IN DATA: 
	NRC shall retain non-exclusive ownership and rights for all NRC meeting webcasts and their contents.


IX.   	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
	The base period is 12-months from date or award with four one-year option periods.


X.   	INVOICES/BILLING:
	Billing reports shall be submitted to the NRC PO monthly describing the services provided and the cost related to each service.  The monthly bill shall be consistent with the contract "pricing schedule".  In addition to the invoice specifying the line-item being billed, the invoice shall state the date(s) service performed.  For each "live" webcast, the invoice shall include the date of the webcast, webcast description listed on the NRC Homepage, the length of the webcast and its total cost.

<DESC>Task: Entry/Exit Airlock for NBC Transportable Protective Shelters

Objective:
The 311 HSW, Human Systems Program Office is seeking information on the commercial capabilities and costs of developing an airlock to be used with Collective Protection (CP) shelters currently in inventory.  There is a possibility of limited procurement of production units in FY04.

Background:
The Joint Services currently use four airlocks for CP shelters: the Protective Entrance (PE), the Tunnel Airlock for Litter Patients (TALP), the Supply Airlock (SA), and the Bump-Through Door (BTD) Airlock.  If personnel are contaminated with CB agents, they must be processed through a decontamination station prior to entering through airlocks.  Once inside the airlock, filtered air is used to remove any remaining airborne contaminants before gaining access into the CP shelter.  All of these airlock systems have their limitations, more specifically, the number of persons that can be accommodated, purge time needed to clear airlock from any contaminants, and durability.  The PE holds one ambulatory person and has a purge time of three minutes; the TALP holds a patient on a litter and has a purge time of one minute. The major limitation is that these two systems can only accommodate one person, and the TALP does not allow the patient to be administered medical assistance.  The SA was developed for the Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) system to bring in medical supplies on an aircraft pallet.  It has a purge time of 55 to 90 minutes, if the recirculation filter is used the minimum the purge time is 55 minutes.  The PE, TALP and SA are modular components of the M28 Collective Protection Equipment (CPE).  The BTD Airlock is a multipurpose continuously purged airlock that allows the entry and exit of personnel and supplies.  It was the result of an effort to develop an airlock system that would expeditiously meet the Air Fore medical community requirements.  It uses two sets of modified hard bump-through-doors already in inventory, an extended vestibule CP liner modified to accommodate the hard doors.  Also, a modified FFA 580 blower/filter unit is used to decrease the purge time of the larger airlock to three minutes by providing a high flow rate of clean air through the airlock.  The current BTD Airlock is a component of the Collectively Protected Expeditionary Medical Support (CP EMEDS) and the AF Transportable Collective Protection System (AF TCPS); it allows the user to bring in two patients on standard NATO litters with litter bearers and attendants or 12 ambulatory personnel.  Dimensions of the standard NATO collapsible litters are as follows:

Overall length is 90 inches
Overall width is 22 7/8 inches
Bed length is 72 inches
Bed width is 22 7/8 inches

Limitations of the BTD Airlock include its weight (950 lbs), packing volume, lack of durability, and set-up complexity (includes blower, filters, ducting, etc).



Requirement:
The intent of this RFI is to collect information on technology that could meet the needs of the Joint Services (limited development may be possible) for a state-of-the-art, lightweight, durable, thermal efficient, and low purge time airlock?s that can accommodate a multiple number of personnel and/or litter patients with litter bearers and medical attendants and to subsequently procure airlocks for Joint Service applications.  The government is interested in capabilities, technologies, reliability, maintainability and technical data for development of a multi-purpose airlock that can operate in an active Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment and must be capable of interfacing with current transportable CP liners and shelters used by the Joint Services.  Currently, a Chemical and Biological (CB) liner made from a 5-layer Saranex laminate is being used in shelters and airlocks to provide CB protection.  Information on new material for the development of a new Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) resistant and thermal efficient liner is also sought.  In addition, information on new technologies for blowers and filtration that are applicable to airlocks is also sought.  Airlock should be rugged with a rigid frame and be easily and rapidly erected without creating a safety hazard.  It must be an improvement over current airlocks in the areas of weight, packing value, and cost.  The airlock will interface with the standard M28 CPE vestibule membrane opening and be compatible with existing CP liner closures adopted in the TEMPER and Air Force Medical Shelter System (AF Small Shelter) shelters.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement is issued in order to determine the interest, work experience and capabilities for potential offerors for a contemplated requirement for a study to determine the feasibility of the development of a Reconfigurable Motion System Platform Trainer to support Multi-Class Ship Control Operator Training for SSN 688/688I, SSBN, SSGN, SSN 21/22, SSN 23, and SSN 774 Class Submarines at various training sites. Existing Ship Control Operator Trainers support training of existing submarine configurations at the following locations: Groton, CT; Norfolk, VA; Pearl Harbor, HI; San Diego, CA; Bangor, WA; and Kings Bay, GA. New submarine configurations and home porting decisions have resulted in new training requirements that call for additional new trainers and/or modifications to existing trainers, allowing them to support multiple classes.  New configurations and locations where training is required are as follows:  Groton (SSN 23 and SSN 774); Norfolk, Pearl Harbor and San Diego (SSN 774 only); Bangor (SSN 23 and SSGN); Kings Bay (SSGN only).   All existing trainers utilize a two-degree of freedom motion platform system with mockups of the applicable controls and indicators interfaced to simulation software.  The SSN 21/22 and SSN 774 class trainers also contain significant amounts of tactical hardware and software integrated into the trainers. The SSN 774 class trainers motion system is electrical. All other existing trainers use hydraulic motion systems. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, provides unique hydrodynamic modeling software for each submarine class including variants. This software is integrated uniquely into each of the trainers due to system architecture differences.  Some of the existing trainers have (or are projected to have) a limited reconfigurable capability to support multiple configurations. Current strategies include the limited use of Flat Panel Displays (FPDs) and swappable hardware panels with configuration specific simulation software.  The envisioned study shall assess the feasibility of developing a reconfigurable motion system platform trainer to support all of the submarine configurations listed above. The following elements shall be included: a) Design/Development considerations (comprised of - 1) reuse/modification of existing software, hardware, and architectures; 2) incorporation of hydrodynamic modeling software; 3) modification of existing trainer versus development of new trainer; 4) changes to existing trainer architectures to reduce life cycle costs; 5) FPD issues; 6) assessment of controls and indicators as FPD candidates; and 7) transfer of knowledge and psychomotor skills especially for casualty training);  and b) Life Cycle Considerations (for all trainers, existing, modified, and new/proposed, comprised of - 1) projected maintenance costs and related life cycle cost reductions; 2) incorporation of changes -cost and lag time for trainer implementation-; 3) incorporation of hydrodynamic model updates; 4) reuse of tactical software (SSN 21/22 and SSN 774 Class);  5) long term reduction in  quantities of trainers required per site.  All interested companies should respond with the following information in contractor format with emphasis on capabilities and previous experience: a) experience and capability with reconfigurable motion system platform trainers; b) knowledge of submarine ship control operation and trainers and/or other motion system platforms (e.g., flight simulators); c) examples of similar studies conducted; d) motion system platform trainer experience of employees on staff; e) background on types of contracts used for the type requirements specified in this notice; f) contract numbers, issuing activities and PCO points of contact.  Responses should be submitted via email to the contract specialist listed, no later than COB on the closing date listed.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to maintain the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Addiction (NCADI) program which will be combined with the Center for Mental Healths Clearinghouse.  The incumbent for each is currently ORC/Macro.

The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), established in conformance with the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and the H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, supports and promotes the goals of demand reduction for the substance abuse field.  Since 1987, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information has served at the Nations single point of entry in the Federal government for comprehensive, customer-friendly information about substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment.  NCADI operations have expanded significantly to meet the order fulfillment needs of the ONDCP National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, SAMHSAs targeted press efforts, CSAPs dissemination and application initiatives as well as its highly targeted public health education campaigns, CSATs knowledge application initiative and public affairs efforts, as well as the dissemination efforts of NIAAA, NIDA, and the Department of Education.

SAMHSAs National Mental Health Information Center (NMHIC) was established as the national focal point of contact about treatment and support services for mental health and mental illness. The Information Center provides appropriate, user-friendly information and referrals to; local, state and Federal agencies, professional organizations and clearinghouses, or national, state, and community mental health organizations and associations.. Under section 520(b)(10), of the Public Health Service Act, CMHS is mandated to establish a mental health information Clearinghouse. It also provides information dissemination support to CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program (during times of disaster), the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services and the School Violence Prevention Program. NMHIC also serves to disseminate information developed by CMHS programs about mental health services to adults with severe mental illnesses, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and family members. The Clearinghouse also assures the widespread dissemination of such information to States, political subdivisions, educational agencies and institutions, treatment and prevention service providers, and the general public.

The Clearinghouse is a contracted program that exists to serve a wide variety of Federal dissemination needs, but its ultimate success is based on its ability to reach the intended target audiences of SAMHSA and its Centers as well as the ONDCP and our other Federal partners.  These target audiences include, but are not limited to, general public, prevention and treatment practitioners, policymakers, community organizers, youth, educators, health care providers, faith-based organizations, social service providers, and the media.  As such, achieving high levels of customer satisfaction across all tasks are a primary focus for the NCADI contract.

Duke Cogema Stone & Webster, LLC (DCS) is seeking companies with experience in design and/or fabrication of gloveboxes, including the integration of mechanical, electrical and instrumentation components to form an assembly that performs a set of process functions.  The integrated assembly is referred to as a Process Unit.  The Process Units to be acquired will support the construction of a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) to be built at the Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS).  For the MFFF, a Process Unit is a single glovebox or series of connected gloveboxes along with the associated process equipment (conveyors, rotating doors, drives, elevators, sensors, other single function machines, etc.) contained within the glovebox confinement boundary and the support equipment (gearboxes, motors, MCCs, PLCs, etc.) located external to the glovebox confinement boundary.  DCS is in the stage of the project where acquisition planning activities must begin.  A major procurement initiative for the MFFF is the acquisition of the Process Units.  Approximately 30 Process Units could be acquired under a design/build contractual arrangement, and between 25 and 60 Process Units could be acquired under a build-to-print contractual arrangement.  The projected total value of all work is in the range of $150 to $300 million dollars.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

This notice is published for the purpose of soliciting information from industry on program management services in support of the Bureau of Industry and Securitys Nonproliferation and Export Control Cooperation Program.  Responses are due to this RFI by March 28, 2003.  It is the Governments intent to accomplish the following:

  a.  Identify potential sources meeting the below identified criteria.
  b.  Obtain information on the below subject matter.
  c.  Comments on Attachment 1- Draft Performance measures for the below program objectives.

2.0	BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION 

The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems.  The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994.  The level and scope of NECs outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems.  For example, in FY 2003, NEC plans to conduct more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75  95).  This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. 

Historically, the NEC group obtained from a combination of Contractors, support in the areas of:

TRAINING DEVELOPMENT - Contractors have worked under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries.  These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum

These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan.  The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives.  The Contractor has maintained a technical library of course material, program books, and other material.  The library has allowed access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.

TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT - Contractors have delivered training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement).   These courses were delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries.  Contractors also delivered training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations.

For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractors have been responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other USG agencies and U.S. industry.  Contractors built and reproduced program books for the technical exchanges/seminars and provided copies of the course material to the foreign trainees.  In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, Contractors have, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, ZIP Drives or other computer peripherals.

MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics.  These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature.  In order to effectively manage these conferences, Contractors have established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities.  

As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group often ensured a US presence at the conferences.  Contractors have work with the NEC group to identify and prep U.S. Industry participants who were part of the US delegation to the conference.  

MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions.  In particular, as the cooperating countrys export control systems have developed, the need to have good industry Government cooperation has become apparent.  In the field of industry Government relations, a contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), has been modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries.  The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Governments export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities.  

Contractors have also worked with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool.  Efforts are made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating countrys specific export control law and regulations.  

A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries.  Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, Contractors have been required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group.  

LOGISTICS SUPPORT  In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, contractors have planned and managed logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.

OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group has required Contractors to perform other unique tasks as they arise.  These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group.

NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for Fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans.

NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.

<SUBJECT>49 -- CONVERSION OF 120,000  LB SUPER
<DESC>AGENCY MISSION:

The Mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the nation's mines.  MSHA carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of extraction.

PROJECT BACKGROUND:

MSHA has a requirement to retrofit the Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center's 120,000 lb. Super "L" Universal Testing Machine.  This machine is used to test every roof bolt system used underground in coal and metal mines.  The testing machine was purchased in the early 70's, and has seen extensive use over the past 30 years.  MSHA intends to award a sole source contract to Tinius Olsen Testing Machine Company, Inc., of Hrosham, PA. for the retrofit and calibration of the Super "L" Universal Testing Machine.  Tinius Olsen company is the only one source capable of a retrofit of this type for this testing machine, due to proprietary components that are needed to integrate an updated controller with our current load frame, which is over 30 years old.  This requirement is considered to be a sole-source procurement in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  This is not a request for information or proposals.  Questions concerning this award should be directed to Vincent Lynch, Contracting Officer, on ph#(202)693-9835; located at MSHA-HQ's Office, 1100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA. 22209-3939.

<SUBJECT>B -- National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Evaluation of Science Enrichment Program (SEP)
<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Goodman Research Group, Inc., pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This contract action will represent nineteen (19) additional months of contract performance for the National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Science Enrichment Program (SEP).    

NCI implemented the SEP in 1990.  The program encourages rising tenth-graders from under-represented minority and medically under-served population to pursue careers in biomedical research.  The overall goals of the program are to:  1) encourage under-represented minority and underserved students to select careers in science, mathematics and/or research, 2) broaden and enrich students? science, research, and socio-cultural backgrounds.  The major objectives through which these goals are met are executed by 1) providing opportunities for student to experience the fields of science, mathematics and laboratory research through hand-on techniques and resources that extend beyond those of the typical high school classroom 2) provide students with an ?I can-do-it? feeling regarding their abilities in the sciences and 3) Contribute to the advancement of a strong core future researchers.  


As of July 2002 approximately 1,750 student had participated in the SEP experience.  Although there are no longitudinal data yet about these students? continuing interests in the sciences as a career, data are beginning to show positive increases in their levels of academic confidence and attitudes about science.  In addition to assessing the aptitudes and attitudes of current students and tracking their progress, the program?s evaluation component also includes a survey of the 1,250  students who participated in SEP prior to 1997.  

The alumni study and collection of data was temporarily halted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  June 2002 pending their approval of NCI?s revised collection plan submitted in March of this year.  The revised plan also included a request for a six-month extension to complete a final round of parent?s surveys.  OMB will provide authorization to continue only after resolution of any issues that may be raised during the lengthy approval process.  

The intent of this sole source action is to allow for the completion of the evaluation of the Science Enrichment Program (SEP) through the following five elements of performance:  1)  Obtaining all required OMB clearance 2)  Develop and implement questionnaires/tests 3)  Develop and maintain a computerized data processing and storage system  4)  Analyze SEP data and interpret results and 5)  conduct site visits as necessary.  The information collected and analyzed by Goodman Research will enable NCI?s management to make an informed, evidenced-based decision regarding the continuation of the SEP program.  The extension will provide contract performance through December 2004.
 
This action is under the authority of 41 USC 253 ?(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All proposals received within 45 days after publication of the synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement (See numbered note 22).

<SUBJECT>A -- Identification and functional characterization of genes involved in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes and further identification of therapeutic targets.
<DESC>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) that will result in the identification and functional characterization of genes involved in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, and allow for identification of therapeutic targets for the development of new drugs to prevent and treat this disease.
The NIDDK is seeking partners to functionally characterize the pathological effects of genes dysregulated in insulin-resistant patients for the commercial development of therapies that will alter expression and/or function of the identified targets.
POTENTIAL AREAS OF APPLICATION: Commercial development of therapies for: 1. Early treatment and prevention of insulin resistance, a precursor to Type 2 diabetes, reversal of metabolic and transcriptional defects in insulin resistance and/or Type 2 diabetes, reversal or prevention of complications that may be secondary to or accompany insulin resistance (i.e. the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, atherosclerosis and hypertension) 2. Detection of clinical markers and development of diagnostic tools and for prediction, detection and stratification of yet unknown subclasses (or stages) of insulin-resistance and Type 2 diabetes important for the design and development of individualized therapies (pharmacogenetics). 3.Development of therapies which have direct, known, predicted effects the disease-causing gene variants and their products which would increase its specificity of action and improve the drug?s toxicological profile.
MAIN ADVANTAGES OF TECHNOLOGY/INVENTION: There are no therapies available for the cure of Type 2 diabetes, and its complications. Current therapies for glycemic control such as thiazolidinediones are not useful in all patients and their mechanisms of action are only partially understood. They are known to cause sometimes life-threatening side effects, and long-term use may lead to therapeutic failure and ultimately the need for insulin replacement.
CURRENT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT: 1.NIDDK currently has a database for skeletal muscle and adipose cells obtained from pre-clinical (or normoglycemic) insulin resistant patients and insulin-sensitive controls. 2.NIDDK has a list of genes in which expression is significantly altered in these patients, and has validated a number of these findings by real-time PCR. 3.NIDDK has developed a novel algorithm, which more sensitively detects changes in gene expression when analyzing data obtained from a leading commercial microarray platform with high gene coverage, Affymetrix GeneChips. 4. NIDDK has tools for systematic study of effects of overexpression of genes on GLUT4 translocation, which can be scaled up for high-throughput analysis (gene screening). These include cell lines/animals stably expressing GLUT4-GFP. 
FURTHER R&D REQUIRED: 1.Further characterization of genetic abnormalities in a larger population of pre-clinical (and clinical) diabetic patients 2.Development of high-throughput screens for pathological function of genes differentially expressed in insulin-regulated tissue of insulin-resistant patients 3. Evaluation and testing of drugs for newly identified therapeutic targets
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
CRADA CONTRIBUTORS EXPERTISE: The role of the CRADA Collaborator may include, but not be limited to: 1.  Providing significant intellectual, scientific, and technical expertise or experience to the research project. 2.  Providing technical and/or financial support to facilitate scientific goals and for further design of applications of the technology outlined in the agreement.
CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages. The capability statement should address the collaborators ability to use high-throughput post-transcriptional gene slicing methods such as RNA interference, to establish the function of target genes of interest in a cellular process. The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in 1. Performing high-throughput functional assays for further characterization of potential disease-causing genes 2. Experience in conducting preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials with small molecules 3. The design and implementation of clinical trials. 4. The capability to scale up production of therapeutics.  Researchers will screen hundreds of genes in real time, enabling rapid identification of the genes and related proteins involved in key biological pathways. The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies (see CRADA: http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf). DATES: Only written CRADA capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 1, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study's Steering Committee on or about April 30, 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA INDUSTRY DAY WORKSHOP - DYNAMIC OPTICAL TAGS
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will be hosting an Industry Day Workshop on the topic of Dynamic Optical Tags (DOTs).  The goal of the DARPA DOTs program is to develop a small, thin, environmentally robust, long lived, modulated optical retro-reflecting tag and a long range interrogation system.  These devices will enable highly precise tag location and reliable and efficient information flow.  The tags will be passive (i.e. in the sleep mode) for most of its operation and  activate only when properly interrogated.  The tags will then begin to modulate the illuminating beam to transmit coded information on the retro-reflecting path.   DOTs will have a wide range of applications in numerous military, logistical, and law enforcement situations.  The DOTs program will be in three phases:  Phase 1: Develop Optical Tag Technologies: Phase I will last 18 months and focus on the development and demonstration of  the optical elements required to support the objectives of the DOTs program.  Phase 2: Design DOTs System:  Phase II  will last 15 months, continue the development of the tag, develop the handheld interrogator, and design an advantaged, i.e. airborne system. At the end of Phase II; the tag will be demonstrated with integrated electronics and all of the features from Phase I.  Phase 3: Build and Demonstrate DOTs System: Phase III will last 15 months and concentrate on building and demonstrating the complete DOTs systems.  This will include building the advantaged, i.e. airborne system, and support the transition of the DOTs system to the military.   The Industry Day Workshop will be held at the George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, Ste 244, 3401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA  22201 on 12 March 2003 from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.  The objectives of this workshop are to: (1) release detailed technical information regarding the DOTs program, (2) present current work and future needs related to DOTs, and (3) to promote technical exchange among government, commercial, academic, and other interested parties.  It is anticipated that successful proposals will involve teaming between different organizations that bring different skill sets to the table to enable integrated solutions to this problem.  The workshop will be unclassified and open.  This workshop will be the primary forum for exploring teaming relationships.  Time will be allocated for invited presentations on Optical Tagging capability and performer background; expect 10 minute speaking blocks.  If interested in presenting, indicate your desire to present and submit your presentation via the workshop registration web page.   Neither proprietary nor unclassified-but-sensitive information may be included in the workshop presentations.
