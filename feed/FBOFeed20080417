<DESC>The FAA has an initial requirement to purchase 1,000 Smart Card Readers. The readers will be used for two-factor authentication into the Maintenance Data Terminal (MDT) laptops.  
The smartcard readers must meet the following criteria:  1.  8-pin connector (slide) 2.  ISO7816 compliant3.  PCMCIA (type II) -68 pin4.  1Mb per sec transfer rate5.  Personal Computer Smart Card group [PC/SC] compatible6.  Microsoft Windows XP host platform7.  Protocol and parameter selection support8.  Operates with fhe following Safeboot technology:  	(a)  SafeBoot Disk Encryption v4.2.7 software 	(b)  SafeBoot 8K STARCOS S2.1c smart cards 
This is an initial procurement and the possibility exists that the FAA may pursue subsequent and additional significant procurements of Smartcard readers (between 5,000 to 10,000 additional readers).    
Market research performed by the FAA leads the FAA to conclude that there appears to be only one commercial product that is currently commercially available and in use:  Mako LT4000 PCMCIA Reader SC.  The purpose of this announcement is to ascertain whether or not there are other commercially available smartcard readers that perform the functions noted above and meet the above-noted specifications.  
For those entities who consider that they have a smartcard reader that meets the above-noted criteria, and they would like the FAA to consider their reader, a response to this announcement is required.  All responses must be received by COB May 2, 2008.  The response must include the following:  
(1)  Clear indication as to which of the above-noted requirements the "proposed" smartcard reader meets; (2)  A description of the proposed smartcard reader including brand-name and product/part number; (3)  A list of at least three customers that have purchased significant quantities of the proposed smartcard readers (including name of company, name of an individual and phone number to contact the named individual)
The FAA is not interested in working with a company to "develop" a smartcard reader.  Rather, the FAA is interested in purchasing existing technology that is currently commercially available and has been deployed with significant customers to substantiate and support a conclusion that the product is a proven and commercially viable product.  
Responses must be received on or before COB May 2, 2008.  Should the FAA not receive any responses to this announcement, the FAA will pursue a procurement to purchase the brand name product noted above (Mako LT4000 PCMCIA Reader SC).  
Responses must be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at:

The Overlook Fire of July 2007, burned nearly 21,083 acres on the Hanford Reach National Monument.  Stabilization and Rehabilitation measures are planned for spring of 2008 through September of 2010, targeting approximately 17,000 acres of the native habitats impacted by this fire.  An effective monitoring program is necessary to assess the short-term success of restoration efforts and to detect effects of invasive species treatments and abatement of erosion processes.  Contractor must be familiar with the vegetation types of the Hanford Reach National Monument in the Columbia Basin of Eastern Washington State.  Successful contractor must possess prior demonstrated work experience in conducting vegetation surveys or inventories within the Pasco basin area.  Documented experience in vegetation inventories and monitoring work on the Hanford site or Hanford Reach National Monument is preferred.  Skills quantifying vegetation, soils, interpreting/communicating results, interpreting site conditions, and making potential management recommendations are desired.  Documented knowledge of current inventory methodologies, plant community associations, past fire occurrences and their impacts to shrub-steppe vegetation is also desired.  Proposed work will include 1) Monitoring survival of native shrub nursery stock; 2)   Monitoring herbicide effectiveness; 3) Monitoring seeding effectiveness; 4) Monitoring vegetation trends;  and 5) final reporting and deliverables.  One firm-fixed price contract will be awarded from this requirement.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical approach, past performance/organization, personnel qualifications/ experience and price.  Evaluations factors as a whole are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as equal, price to the Government will be a major selection factor.

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure by full and open competition an upgraded Critical Cockpit System (CCS) for the AH-1W aircraft. The overarching goal of this project is to meet the Blue Force Situational Awareness (BFSA) requirements.  The core control and display functions of the BFSA solution and current CCS functions must reside in the current physical locations of the Control Display Navigation Units and the Interface Control Units. To ensure these parameters are met, a site visit will take place on either May 6th or 7th from 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M, with the option for additional days to be added if required.  Each contractor will be allotted approximately two (2) to three (3) hours to view the aircraft. In addition the contractor will be provided a standard sheet of paper for any questions they might have. The questions will be recorded and answered via the following website: http://www.navair.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.  This site visit is highly encouraged  by the government. Early participation is encouraged as future site visits, if any, will be limited to maintain contract schedule and due to limited aircraft availability. Information for this visit must be received by 1 May to ensure you have access to the base (please fill out attachment 3). The only expected exception to these constraints is that the Government recognizes the BFSA requirement shall include accommodating an additional transceiver and its associated antenna system. The initial procurement will consist of six (6) systems with four (4) option periods to follow. The option quantities will range from 1-125 systems.   

A Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and Draft copies of Attachment (1) Statement of Work for AH-1W Critical Cockpit Upgrade (CCU) Project and Attachment (2) Contract Data Requirements List package (Exhibit A001-D006) will be posted to the NAVAIR solicitation website at http://www.navair.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations. The purpose of releasing this draft RFP is to obtain industry feedback regarding the content of the draft RFP. If applicable, information will possibly be incorporated into the formal RFP, which will be released approximately 12 June 2008. Proposals will be due approximately fifty (50) days after release of formal RFP. The Draft solicitation number is N00019-08-R-0050. Contract award is anticipated in FY09.  

NOTE: This program includes information that has been designated as “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors. In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms. Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security. Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act. Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under by the U.S. Department website. http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.



To participate, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program. Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy, and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents. 

Prior to release of any control documents under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations. Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor’s responsibility under the US Export laws and regulations, the requested attachments will be provided. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Registration in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information on the CCR. Refer to the CCR website at http://ccr.gov/index.cfm.

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is interested in receiving proposals/ white papers which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Targeting Accuracy Systems.  There is an urgent need for components or systems capable of improving targeting accuracy.  Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment.  
Technical questions should be directed to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division Code XDS11C, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110, or email to dlgr_nswc_xds11@navy.mil. 
Topic Areas of Interest / ObjectivesThe following topics are areas of current interest:	Topic: A. Azimuth Sensing System  There is an urgent need for a system capable of improving targeting accuracy.  Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment.  Currently only laser designation provides a practical solution to this problem, however, this makes the operator vulnerable to counterattacks.  Accurate knowledge of a user location coupled with range, heading, and elevation to target provides a solution where a brief range-finding designation will allow for a targets location to be know well enough to call for a precision strike.
	Provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing system for use on man-portable targeting devices such as laser range finders and laser designators.  This system shall eliminate well known problems with digital magnetic compasses.  This will allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, and while wearing body armor.  The system will improve on the accuracy of a digital magnetic compass even in good magnetic environments.  Reduce Target Location Error (TLE) to be less than 10m, permitting accurate target location at ranges of 10km from observer to target.
	Due to the needs of the user, the system must work inside a building and be small in size.  These limitations rule out the use of all current GPS interferometrics and star finder technologies.  The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing, however novel ideas are encouraged.
	The program goals require objective parameters to be demonstrated within 3 years.  The systems characteristic are as follows: 
		Threshold 			a. Man portable fieldable item			b. Less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracy			c. Boresightable to optics			d. Volume less than 0.1 cu fte. 6 mils azimuth accuracy			f. 5 lbs			g. 500 deg/s survivable slew rate (may need recalibration)h. less than 200 sec startup time
		Objective			a. Handheld fieldable item			b. less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracy			c. Boresightable to optics			d. Volume no more than 0.25 cu ine. 1 mils azimuth accuracy			f. 0.5 lbs			g. 1000 deg/s operational slew rate (without recalibration)			h. less than 30 sec startup time 
Topic: B. Lightweight Modular DesignatorThe Marine Corps is looking to improve on the weight and usability of current laser designator technologies.  Current man portable designator technologies weigh as much as 30 lbs including batteries.  Reducing this weight is the primary motivator behind this effort.  
Recent reduction in output energy requirements and improvements in laser technology have made new opportunities available for laser designators.  The specifications listed below are the threshold requirements for this new system.
Specifications	1.064 um wavelength	50 mJ output energy	PRF code capable	Designate at least 5 km	96  1 minute designations	No more than 5 lbs including batteries	Designator must boresight to optics
Topic: C. Laser Designator ResearchThe Marine Corps is looking for opportunities to help transition research and lab development to fieldable technologies.  This opportunity is limited to the field of handheld laser designation.  Areas of interest include but are not limited to:	Novel laser technologies	Novel seeker technologies	Laser spot imaging technologies	1.54um wavelength laser and seeker technologies
Topic: D. Power Solutions for Distributed OperationsCurrent small unit power is focused on BA-5590, BB-2590, or similar battery technologies.  The current requirement is to reduce number, weight, and types of replacement batteries required to support electrical needs of a dismounted unit.  Current systems limit the ability for a dismounted unit to recharge batteries.  New and emerging technologies have the potential to significantly improve the logistics burden incurred by distributed and dismounted small unit operations.  Areas of interest include but are not limited to:	Power generation technologies for small, dismounted units as well as squad level	Battery charging technologies for small, dismounted units as well as squad level	Various methods for recharging batteries integrated into one package (ex:  hand crank, host country power, DC, solar, etc.)Program goals require initial technology demonstration within 1 year, with a fieldable system demonstrated within 2 years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

10 Dec 07: The purpose of this post is to provide Industry the current status on the JTC TRS Program.  See attached file labeled JTC TRS status 10 Dec 2007.pdf.
*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

The place of performance for this requirement will be at the 6 Security Forces Squadron, MacDill AFB.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide design/layout, delivery, and installation of all equipment needed to support the Battle Staff room, Control Center and Alarm Monitor rooms, Conference Room, Classroom and Building Media and Information Systems.</p>
<p><br />The Control Center sources sought will have the following specifications (these specifications are not meant to be definitive, but represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported):</p>
<p>1. General: The unique nature of security force operations require specially designed and installed equipment to make best use of the man hours used. During contingencies three or more major operations may be executed simultaneously, each requiring different procedures and each critical to the base's ability to continue its mission. The below specialty areas require additional furniture and systems acquisitions to enable the SFS to provide optimum support to the base mission. Selection will be based on the submission that best supports Security Force operations.</p>
<p>1.1. Battle Staff (BDOC): Primarily provides oversight for security operations during contingencies. The Commander and staff need access to up to the minute information about contingency situations, current manning, and responding forces so that they can evaluate and direct forces effectively to limit damage to the base mission. A Battle Staff Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #1 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.2. Control Center: The security control center is the nerve center of security force operations, receiving input from the field, synthesizing it for use by the Battle Staff, and enacting orders of the Battle Staff. A Control Center Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #2 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.3. Conference Room: A comprehensive presentation system is desired; video conferencing capability is also desired.<br />1.4. Training Classroom: A comprehensive presentation system that includes a video recording package is needed.<br />1.5. Media and Information System: The building is designed with a number of video screens throughout. A media package that connects these to the base IPTV system and allows us to post crucial information that will page across the screen, keeping security forces informed without the use of multiple bulletin boards placed around the building is needed.</p>
<p>Services Summary:<br />Room 133: Battle Staff (BDOC)<br />Count Item<br />1 Furniture and systems that support the concept of operations in Attachment 1.<br />1 Video Conference Capabilities.<br />1 At least three workstations within the battle staff room with network access.<br />1 Wireless capability to arrange Control Center video wall feed display from this room.<br />Room 134 &amp; 135: Control Center/Alarm Monitor</p>

<p>3. Appendices: 1. Battle Staff (BDOC) Concept of Operations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Control Center Concept of Operations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Attachment #1<br />Battle Staff<br />Concept of Operations</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Battle Staff Room Details:</p>
<p>The Battle Staff is manned by a senior SF member(s) during a contingency or emergency situation. The person(s) working in this room need the ability to monitor all actions being taken by the Security Forces Control Center Operator, yet also be able to conduct their own business uninterrupted. Therefore the best concept is for the battle staff room to overlook the SFCC, separated by windows. Ideally, there would be a doorway between the two rooms and a sliding window at a reasonable location where the SFCC Operator and Battle Staff members could exchange paperwork and information.</p>
<p>Equipment needed is as follows:<br />- STE (1 minimum) for ability to contact outside agencies on a secure line<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to GEOBASE or other emergency response tools. Wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to completing reports, papers, etc., as required based on the situation, wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Printer.<br />- 1 copy machine (this could be shared with SFCC)<br />- 1 fax machine - better if this one is dedicated to Battle Staff.<br />- Workstations for 3-4 personnel, including desk space, chairs.<br />- Reference library with access to all required checklists, 0Plans, AFIs, etc. <br />- Large base grid map and mapping tools (disks, dry erase markers, etc.) <br />- Large dry erase white board w/supplies<br />- 1 or 2 lockers with emergency response kits/supplies inside them. (Currently we just have this stuff stuck in a corner).<br />- Lighting controls - recessed lighting with dimmers works best<br />- Phone systems with 2-4 lines including direct line to EOC, Command Post, etc. Small area for coffee pot, supplies, microwave.<br />- Ability for Video Tele Conference setup. All required hardware and software will be coordinated with pertinent on base agencies that support this service (COMM).<br />- MacDill Base station- ability to switch frequencies talk to any org on base via base station/handheld radio.<br />- Wall mount flat screen w/cable of IPV hookup for local/national news stations for updated news during catastrophe, national emergency, hurricane evacuation, etc.</p>

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Narcotics Affairs Section, Embassy Port-au-Prince.  The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and on international criminal justice and law enforcement issues for the Department of State.

The incumbent of this position serves as the Program Manager of USG’s police advisory program in Haiti, and as a senior advisor to the NAS Director, and through him/her, to the Chief of Mission (COM) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Latin America Programs on issues relating to the policies and programs for improving the security situation in Haiti.  The Program Manager/senior advisor will be physically located in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  While in Haiti, the incumbent works directly under the supervision of the NAS Director advising him/her on the full range of issues for which he/she is responsible.  The incumbent will also coordinate closely with the program officer(s) directly responsible for Haiti within INL and with the political section in Port au Prince, as directed by the NAS Director in Port au Prince.

The situation in Haiti changed dramatically in February 2004 with growing levels of violence leading to the departure of the Haitian President and a change in the Haitian government.  While the US and others provided a near-term military presence, the United Nations committed to the long-term deployment of a military and police stabilization force to assist Haiti’s reestablishment of security throughout the country.  The need to establish security, in an environment of continuing violence and domestic turbulence, became and remains the dominant US and UN policy goal in Haiti.  Hence, the priority of Haitian National Police (HNP) support programs will remain crucial to the success of US policy goals and to US national security.

The Police Program Manager is the primary U.S. interlocutor with the Director General of the HNP and the UN Civilian Police Commissioner. The Program Manager helps provide USG oversight of US CIVPOL seconded to the UN CIVPOL Mission, among other duties.

Major Duties and Responsibilities

The Program Manager has primary responsibility for providing senior-level advice and assistance to the NAS Director, and through him/her, to the DAS for Latin America Programs and the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti in the formulation and implementation of policies for an effective police support program, including staff supervision and oversight of INL-funds dedicated to the program ($8.927M in FY08).  The incumbent also serves as the Law Enforcement Advisor to the Chief of Mission, in the absence of the permanently assigned NAS Director from Post.

•	Provides policy analysis and guidance to the NAS Director, and through him/her, to the Ambassador, senior policy specialists in INL and regional bureaus on the most effective means to promote security and police reform in Haiti.

•	Participates in meetings to develop plans/programs for implementation of police programs and integration with UN programs, and advises the NAS Director on, and as needed, represents the USG in coordinating US HNP support programs with the General Officer commanding the UN military mission, and with the UN police (CIVPOL) commissioner, as well as with other diplomatic missions and international donors.

•	In the absence of the permanently assigned NAS, serves as Narcotics/Law Enforcement Advisor to the COM, providing counternarcotics/law enforcement policy and program assistance to the country team, the Haitian Government and the HNP.  Provides current analysis and up-to-date information on narcotics/crime issues and assists in determining where these issues fit on the bilateral priority list and where/when they need to be discussed in bilateral and/or multilateral fora.  Acts as a catalyst and conduit for information exchanges on strategic efforts in the areas of law enforcement and judicial and criminal justice system reform.   

•	Monitors and interprets region-wide narcotics/crime trends, policy decisions and developments, and makes recommendations to the NAS Director, and through him/her, to the US Ambassador to Haiti and the DAS for Latin America Programs and other senior INL managers which form the basis for potential agreements between the U.S. and Haiti on narcotics/law enforcement related activities.

•	Acts with authority in ensuring that the plans, decisions, priorities and commitments of the NAS Director, COM and INL senior management team are understood and implemented.  As requested, attends meetings on behalf of the NAS Director as well as the COM and Senior INL management officals, representing their points of view on critical program/policy issues.  

•	Plans, coordinates and executes, with NAS Director approval, a significant, multi-year HNP assistance effort ($8.927 for FY08) to include significant expansion of the size of the HNP, basic and in-service training programs, infrastructure improvements, and vehicle and equipment procurement components; provides professional advice and assistance in the planning and acquisition of non-lethal law enforcement equipment for the HNP. Based on extensive internal and external research, determines best procurement strategy, ensuring that the Bureau’s funds dedicated to these projects are managed in the most efficient and effective manner. 

•	Analyzes proposed technical infrastructure project plans and related documentation and prepares relevant Statements of Work, and procurement actions to support and implement those projects.

•	Based on incumbent’s network of contacts throughout the Department bureaucracy, in other agencies within the law enforcement and foreign affairs communities, among Congressional staffs, and with interested NGOs, he/she provides an independent analysis of and advice on on-going and prospective policy issues related to specific areas of responsibility to the NAS Director and, as appropriate, for use by COM and senior INL management.

•	Works closely with the NAS Director and the Bureau’s senior managers to conceptualize programs, determine program needs and priorities based on the international narcotics and crime threat to U.S. interests and opportunities and constraints to implement programs abroad.  As the recognized authority on police and anticrime programs in Haiti, incumbent’s advice on the critical importance of these programs impacts on the NAS Director, COM and the Bureau’s senior management decisions with respect to identifying resources, determining funding and personnel requirements needed to continue support for these programs.

<DESC>Request for InformationCategory: Real Property Management
DisclaimerThis Request For Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must mark their responses accordingly and USBR will ensure proper handling.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.
IntroductionThe Department of the Interior's (DOI) Bureau of Reclamation (USBR or Reclamation) is developing its requirements to collect and manage the reporting requirements associated with the asset inventory and linking real property assets with the appropriate financial data.  In addition USBR is looking to fulfill Federal Real Property Council (FRPP) reporting requirements issued in June of 2007.
USBR is open to alternative ideas and therefore encourages respondents to provide information about alternative methods (COTS Products) for meeting/further defining the requirements within this RFI.
BackgroundExecutive Order 13327 was signed on February 4, 2004 and is the authority for the President's Management Agenda (PMA) for Real Property Asset Management in the Federal government.  There are a number of related activities such as disposition of assets, transportation, motor vehicles, energy, and space management that have links with real property assets, most of which are reported in a number of data systems across the Federal government, DOI , and USBR.  Most of the activities are being monitored through the use of scorecards by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of the PMA.
E.O. 13327 created the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), which has a senior real property officer from each agency in the Federal government represented on the council.  Through collaborative efforts with staff from FRPC members, created the data elements that came to be known as the FRPP.  Initially there were 23 data elements introduced in the fall of 2005 and there are currently 24 data elements with the most recent addition being incorporated in June 2007.  The FRPP managed by the GSA and takes the place of the Form 1166 that was the official reporting document for real property assets in the Federal government.
Business NeedUSBR personnel have been using Microsoft's Access and Excel software for the inventory and data reporting needs into the FRPP.  Staff has recognized the need for more sophisticated approaches and solutions for using and sharing corporate data within USBR as well as for external reporting requirements such as the FRPP.
Current requirements USBR believes are "Must Have":
(1)	A web based solution accessible by user account anywhere within the USBR network.(2)	Ability to collect, manager, and report on USBR Assets in accordance with the 2007 Guidance for Real Property Inventory Reporting, Issue date:  June 8, 2007 (2007 Guidance).  
(3)	Ability to collect, manage, and report on USBR Assets three (3) additional data elements for financial reporting purposes.  (acquisition cost, accumulated depreciation, and interest during construction)(4)	Logging to include access, changes (additions, deletions, modifications) to data elements(5)	Upon data entry validation for conformance to the 2007 Guidance and include agreement between data fields(6)	Cost file summary report (730 Report) for real property data (See Appendix A for details.)(7)	Ability to manage users account access levels to regional data, multiple regions, or all regions.(8)	Ability to manage users permissions levels such as read only, edit only, creation and deletion or any combination of these roles.(9)	Ability to handle a minimum load of 30 users across USBR(10)	Export capabilities to; 1) Extensible Markup Language (XML); and 2) Microsoft Excel.(11)	Reporting capabilities such as; total number of assets by asset type, total number of assets by legal interest, total number of assets by status, total acreage by rural an urban acres, total square footage, total value by asset type, total annual operating cost, number of constructed assets by asset type and use code, number of dispositions reported by disposition method, number of real property unique identifiers reported in year XX and not in year YY, performance measures, and certification of information.(12)	Mass Upload capabilities to incorporate current USBR FRPP data being tracked in MS Excel format.(13)	Secure application to meet Federal Requirements for a multi-use system.(14)	Generate administrative variance reports (graphically/text format) displaying updated data and for data not uploaded during the year, or specific data call time range.
Current requirements USBR believes are "Would be nice to have":
(1)	Ability to easily import/export and/or dynamically link to other COTS products such as for example IBM Maximo (2)	Ability to easily import/export and/or dynamically link to custom build application that may be specific to USBR.  This can be demonstrated by explaining the capability of your solution to link to application and the technology used.
How to RespondInterested parties should provide a statement of interest as attachment in electronic mail format on company letterhead to Kim Gomez kgomez@do.usbr.gov by COB May 7, 2008.  Statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 20 pages (this limit excludes the 1 page cover letter).  Extracts from brochures are acceptable, but they must clearly address the requirements outlined in this document.  The statement should include, as a minimum, the following information:  
(1)	ability to meet the "Must Have" requirements or comments as to why USBR should not consider these as "Must Have Requirements(2)	ability to meet the "Nice to Have" requirements or comments as to why USBR should not consider these as "Nice to Have" Requirements(3)	additional features above and beyond the "Must Have" and "Nice to Have" that could provide benefit and USBR should consider as "Must Have"(4)	both the minimal and recommend hardware/software specifications for operation of the specified solution(5)	company point of contact, telephone number, and email address for additional information requests

Contracting questions to Kimberly Miles, 301-504-7018, kmiles@cpsc.gov.  INTRODUCTION:  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff is seeking information from the scientific community, health and safety professionals, academia, consumer groups, industry representatives, voluntary standards associations and the general public about approaches for enhancing quantitative measures of the safety of consumer products. Enhancements should be both meaningful and practical. The agency is also seeking information about how to implement a cost-effective system to collect and analyze data to be able to produce these enhanced measures.  BACKGROUND:  CPSC is an independent regulatory agency, established in 1973, with jurisdiction over thousands of products used by consumers in and around homes.  The agency administers five laws as follows: •Consumer Product Safety Act •Federal Hazardous Substances Act •Flammable Fabrics Act •Poison Prevention Packaging Act and the  •Refrigerator Safety Act.  Under these laws, the agency recalls unsafe products, establishes mandatory standards for certain products, participates in the voluntary standards development process for certain products, conducts information and education campaigns about product safety, and tests consumer products for compliance with laws and standards.  The agency bases its actions to reduce the risks from hazardous consumer products on information developed from its extensive data collection systems that are used to assess the causes, frequency, and severity of consumer product-related injuries.  In the late 1980s CPSC staff developed a Comprehensive Plan to determine compliance rates for a variety of regulated products (i.e., consumer products directly subject to the law).  The Comprehensive Plan was designed to examine the compliance of these products on a periodic basis, and then identify problem areas so as to focus agency resources on these areas.  The Plan involved prioritizing a number of product categories and then scheduling studies in the categories considered to be of high priority.  The model for prioritization contained factors involving the hazard, the specific industry, and previous compliance history in the product category.  A number of studies were then conducted.  Common factors in these studies included the following: •Selection of a product or class of products for study •The development of a frame for sampling retail stores, manufacturers, wholesalers, or importers (collectively:  establishments), as required by a particular study •Selection of a sample of establishments from the frame  •Visits to establishments and testing of study consumer products on-site or at the CPSC Engineering Laboratory •Estimation of the proportion of complying and non-complying products sold in the U.S. for the product under study.   Some examples of studies carried out under the Comprehensive Plan, with the associated mandatory standard in parenthesis were as follows:  •A 1994 survey on adult sleepwear to determine compliance with regulations on the flammability of clothing textiles (16 CFR 1610). •A 1994 study to evaluate compliance with the bicycle standard (16 CFR 1512).  For the most part, these studies were very labor intensive, requiring travel by agency field staff to different parts of the country and occasionally resulting in expensive product testing.  These studies did not continue after the mid 1990s because it was believed that agency resources would be more appropriately targeted on emerging hazardous products, or products that were suspected of being defective or non-compliant with voluntary or mandatory standards.  In addition, it appeared from the Comprehensive Plan studies, injury surveillance, and other studies that overall compliance with agency regulations was high.  However, one problem with targeting resources toward certain potentially hazards products is that if successfully targeted, compliance rates will be low and unrepresentative of the entire product population in that product category.  Thus it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate safety metrics for all products within a particular category if the sample is selected to target the most hazardous or most non-compliant products in that category.  REQUEST:  CPSC staff would like to build on the knowledge gained from previous studies, information in various existing surveillance systems and other knowledge-based systems to develop cost effective, enhanced metrics of consumer product safety.  As well as an overall metric or metrics of product safety, agency staff would like metrics associated with vulnerable subpopulations, such as children under 6 and adults over 65.  Metrics could also be classified by types of activities, such as sports and recreation, cooking, or day care; or to specific product groups, such as home heating equipment, children’s jewelry (lead hazard), or bicycles.   These are presented as examples and should not be understood to represent the only activities or products of interest.  Agency staff is particularly interested in metrics associated with two agency strategic goals.  These are as follows: •Fire Hazards:  Reduce the rate of death from fire-related causes by 20 percent from 1998 to 2013. •Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Hazard:  Reduce the rate of death from CO poisoning by 20 percent from the 1999-2000 average by the year 2013.  Also, a major agency focus is on reducing injuries and deaths associated with hazards to children from consumer products, especially imported products.  For more details on agency activities and goals, see the 2008 Performance Budget (Operating Plan), available from the agency on request or at http://www.cpsc.gov/.  GENERAL QUESTIONS: To summarize, agency staff is looking for a general approach that would result in the following: 1. A planned approach involving both agency staff and stakeholders that would lead to enhanced and credible metrics of consumer product-related safety.  2. Investigation of various data sources to augment current surveillance system data that would be used in such a system to estimate the measures.  3. How such data would be analyzed to produce the required metrics.
4. Approximate costs for development and operation of a system to provide these metrics.
The agency is also interested in the capability of respondents to develop and operate such a system.  In addressing the general questions above the respondent should provide some detailed information about the following: 1. The process of identifying stakeholders.
2. Approaches to involve stakeholders at the beginning and during the process.
3. Technical approaches leading to the development of a credible, cost-efficient and useful measure(s) of product safety.  4.  Some product safety measures that might be used in such a study along with the appropriate denominators reflecting exposure.  5.  Experiences of other regulatory agencies and experiences of the respondent with this type of project.
6.  The use and/or adaptation of CPSC agency data sources and available non-agency data, e.g., health surveys, insurance data, etc. in these metrics. 7. Incorporation of measurements of product compliance from targeted surveys of products likely to be hazardous and product compliance measurements from routine surveillance, such as surveillance of imported products at the ports.  8.	Special approaches for enhanced metrics of product safety for chronic hazards such as lead ingestion that for the most part are not captured in hospital emergency department surveillance system data.  9.	Study designs including the general outline for studies with details such as how often studies would be undertaken and where.  Also plans to incorporate the ability to track these product safety metrics over time. 
10.  Rough estimates of the time, cost, and other resources to create a plan for and implement a working system for measuring product safety.   HOW TO RESPOND: Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing how such a project would be conducted.  Previous studies conducted by the respondent or studies of which the respondent is aware that are relevant to this RFI should be summarized.  Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the CPSC Division of Procurement Services address indicated above, no later than May 30, 2008.  Responses may be submitted by e-mail, fax (301-504-0628), or US Mail.

<CONTACT>Brian R. Ellis, Phone (202) 366-4843, Email brian.ellis@dot.gov
<DESC><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to award a 12 month sole source contract to Dynamic Research, Inc. (DRI) of Torrance, CA. The purpose of this Award is to assure that NTHSA has the ability to conduct dynamic rollover testing throughout the year for the New Car Assessment Program.  This requires that NHTSA have a contract with a company with a test facility that both matches the specifications required for the testing involved and that is located in a climate that will minimize delays in testing due to weather.   NHTSA knows of no other concern that can perform the required Fishhook Maneuver Test Procedure, as described in the attached Final Policy Statement (68 FR 59250), and that is located in a temperate climate that allows for year round testing.</p>
<p>Dynamic rollover testing has been successfully conducted at the Transportation Research Center (TRC) in East Liberty, Ohio.  However, the weather there each year brings testing to a near standstill during the winter months.  Therefore, for NHTSA to fulfill the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act requirement for a dynamic rollover test and the SAFETEA-LU "Stars on Cars" requirement that all new cars be labeled with safety information including rollover information, a facility in a warm climate is required to minimize weather related delays in NHTSA's dynamic rollover testing and to ensure that consumer safety information based on that testing is promptly available.  NHTSA anticipates 40 to 50 light duty vehicles will be dynamically rollover tested annually with the rollover safety ratings derived from that testing posted on the vehicles' Monroney label (new vehicle price sticker) and on the NHTSA website WWW.SAFERCAR.GOV once testing is completed.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), the Government intends to solicit only one source.</p>
<p>Interested concerns that feel they have the necessary capabilities to conduct the required dynamic rollover testing in accordance with the Final Policy Statement (68 FR 59250), are located in an area whose weather allows for testing throughout the year, and have a vehicle dynamics area (VDA) whose pavement matches the pavement specifications in 68 FR 59250, are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement speaking to these three points.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <strong>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE</strong>; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with a negotiated award to DRI.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with 
Saarland University in Saarbrucken, Germany, for purchase of additional and re-formatted data for NIST Standard Reference Database Number 46: Critically Selected Stability Constants of Metal Complexes. 

NIST Standard Reference Database number 46 provides thermochemical data for complexes consisting of ligands and metal ions or protons. This data has applications in analytical chemistry as well as basic chemical research. The database currently contains data for 6166 ligands. It is shipped as a program for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Data used by this program is in files which are a non-standard format devised by the database developer. Source code to the database program was not provided by the developer.

The database was developed at Texas  A&M University for NIST and has been distributed since 1993. There have been eight version of the database released;  the database was last updated in 2004. In order to extract and use the existing data (which is a proprietary format known only to the developer) the existing data format must be reverse-engineered. In order to provide an up-to-date database for its customers, NIST needs to have the existing data converted to a format which can be read by standard tools. In addition the data set needs to be updated with additional data to make it more current. In addition the University of Saarland has demonstrated that they have the technical ability to properly collect and abstract data of this type.
 
Saarland University/Dr. Stefan Stucky is the only source able to perform the entire work required. 

 The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

<RESPDATE>050208
<CONTACT>Charlene A. Yaple, Phone 816-426-7531, Email charlene.a.yaple@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is soliciting sources for the refurbishment of one existing auto-buoy package and construction of an additional buoy and monitoring of both buoys while they are deployed in waters off Jacksonville, FL during November 2008 to April 2009, for the Passive Acoustic Monitoring of North Atlantic Right Whales in the Southeastern United States.
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 is responsible for the management of marine mammal population. The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery and safeguard the quality of their habitat. The population of right whales in the western North Atlantic is highly endangered. NOAA Fisheries is proposing to continue a program to utilize autonomous passive monitoring devices to gather data on the presence of right whales in the southeast United States. The objectives of this project are as follows: 1. to deploy two passive acoustic auto-detection buoys near Jacksonville, FL to collect data on calving right whale vocalizations during the 2008/2009 winter calving season. 2. The buoys will be deployed during a six-month period beginning in November 2008. 3. The monitoring system will provide near real-time notification of right whale detections delivering data to land stations at least every five hours.</p>
<p>The passive acoustic monitoring units require the following capabilities: (1) the ability to record sounds in the frequency of right whale contact calls to digital media for underwater deployments of at least six (6) months. (2) Buoyant housings that can withstand water pressures at depths greater than 100 feet and sufficiently rugged to survive the high wave energy experienced on the Southeast Atlantic continental shelf during winter months. (3) On-board systems to automatically identify right whale acoustic calls and notify land-based stations through cellular or satellite phone communication. (4) Equipment necessary to communicate with land-based systems for display and monitoring of right whales contacts.</p>
<p>Historically, the equipment has been available from only one known source, Cornell University. Cornell and their subcontractor, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) has been successful in developing buoys. WHOI produces the buoys and Cornell designs, manufactures and implements an electronic instrumentation package; detection recognition software, communications hardware/software and web based detection, classification and notification systems. The Government does not have specifications for the buoys or the electronic instrumentation package. Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; detailed descriptive literature of the products that it has provided previously for the same or similar effort, and a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to supply the required passive acoustic monitoring units and a system to archive and disseminate collected data which will be considered by the agency. Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>Central Region Acquisition Division, requires that all Contractors doing business with this officer be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice

The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is hereby conducting a market survey of all potential sources of vibration reduction systems.  The intended use for the system is to reduce the vibration caused by imbalance of rotating machinery, such as axial flow air propellers and centrifugal flow lift fans, on Naval Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs).  The information provided will assist NSWCCD in understanding the technologies available to perform this function.  The Government is looking for current and available technology in the open market, not new technology in a developmental stage.  This market survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. 

Description
This section provides a set of performance characteristics that meet the needs of a potential demonstration system, although consideration will be given to minor deviations from these requirements.  
The rotating machinery which is subject to imbalance has the following operational characteristics:1.	Maximum rotational speeds between 1000 and 2200 RPM.2.	Absorbed power between 2 and 7 MW (2,600-9,300 SHP).3.	Drive shaft outer diameter between 12 and 45 cm (4.7-17.7 inches).4.	Permissible vibration limits (approximate):	less than 0.65 cm/s for propellers	less than 0.90 cm/s for lift fans 5.	Exposure to the weather and saltwater and sand spray.

Responses
Responses to this market survey should include supporting materials that demonstrate your companys competence, experience, and overall understanding of the requirements that NSWCCD has identified.  The following information is requested (please indicate if the information is an estimate or actual)
1.	Description of the technology2.	Development history and status3.	Applications and history of fielded systems
4.	Installation and integration requirements5.	ROM cost and development schedule for a prototype system6.	ROM cost and lead time for production units7.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market search" for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA has need for a contractor to provide support to the EPA's Office of Water, Office of Wastewater Management (OWM), in supporting the implementation of water-efficiency programs.  In 2006, EPA launched a voluntary public-private partnership program that seeks to protect the future of the nation's water supply by promoting water efficiency and enhancing the market for water-efficient products, services, systems, and practices.  This market-enhancement program helps end-users identify water-efficient products and programs. The WaterSense? label indicates that these products and programs meet water-efficiency and performance criteria. WaterSense labeled products perform well, help save money, and encourages innovation in manufacturing.  The contractor's efforts will broadly support the EPA's efforts to increase water efficiency in the U.S.
The successful contractor will be expected to provide technical support services to aid the Agency in the following task areas primarily in the water efficiency arena: market transformation strategy development; technical analysis of programs and products; voluntary specification development for products, programs, and/or services; general voluntary program support; market/industry analysis; partnership development; product certification and conformity assessment; tracking, evaluation & analysis; marketing and outreach; consumer education; customer service/relationship management;  recognition; website development and maintenance; and general outreach materials development such as, case studies, newsletters, slide shows, brochures, videos, public displays, etc.  
Potential organizations must possess: 1) thorough understanding of sustainable infrastructure principles, 2) thorough understanding of EPA voluntary partnership programs, 3) thorough understanding of green building principles and specifically water-efficiency technologies, practices and procedures, demonstrated experience conducting analysis and program evaluation, 4) demonstrated ability to develop and implement market transformation strategies, 5) the ability to effectively communicate with a wide variety of stakeholders. 
In keeping with the potential tasks, contractors submitting capabilities statements should address their ability to provide, or have access to, senior technical experts in: water efficiency, market transformation approaches, engineering & technical services, primary and secondary market research, green building industry, home construction, energy & energy efficiency, plumbing industry, irrigation industry, new homes industry, commercial building industry, medical equipment industry, food service industry, national standards for certification, water utilities, electric utilities, web development, electronic/web tools development, data management, account management, program participant recruiting, marketing, outreach, social marketing, consumer education, graphic design, video production, conference support, meeting facilitation, recognition programs and tracking & measurement.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts.  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in February 2009 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 32,500 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period with contractor's needing to provide as much as an additional 15,000 hours for a total of 237,500 hours in total for all periods if all the potential LOE hours are realized.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611with a size standard of $6,500,000.  
Under previous acquisitions for effort to support similar requirements the EPA has restricted specific types of firms from receiving a contract award due to an inherent conflict of interest.  The conflict of interest stems from an offeror's involvement in developing product specifications or managing the product certification process under which the products are certified to receive the WaterSense label.  The specific types of firms are: Firms that own, operate, consult for or invest in companies that make or sell products that are eligible to earn or have earned the WaterSense label; and firms involved in the testing and certification of products to the WaterSense specifications (licensed certifying bodies).  
The types of firms in these categories may include: plumbing product manufacturing plants, irrigation product manufacturing plants, water-using medical devices manufacturing plants, retailers or wholesalers of water-using medical devises, manufacturers of water-using food service industry devices, manufacturers of water reuse systems, and manufacturers of cooling equipment. A firm supporting the EPA's WaterSense program could become biased in its performance if it had any of the attributes or associations described above.  Furthermore, the WaterSense label which is issued by EPA may give a firm that manufactures or sells WaterSense labeled products a marketing advantage. 
Any interested firm should submit information which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures alone will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   The information should include: size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified Hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned small business concern, point of contact, telephone number, email and interest in proposing on the solicitation when issued.  
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses if it determines that there are two or more small businesses able to compete in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  If set aside, a small business would be required to perform at least 50 percent of the direct labor costs incurred under the contract with its own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  Capability statements from small businesses should address their ability to meet this requirement.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Angela Schopler, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or schopler.angela@epa.gov, no later than May 1, 2008.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<a href="mailto:janet.maldonado@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter (SPAWARSYSCEN), Charleston,Code 5.3.1.6, is soliciting informationfrom potential sources to provide treeaugers and camera mounts for usewith the Marine Corps Tactical RemoteSensor Systems System-of-System(TRSS SoS).  The TRSS SoS uses hand-emplaced sensors to support the fieldcommanders intelligence collectioneffort by providing continuous, widearea surveillance of the battlefield.The tree auger and camera mounthave been designed and tested andonly require full rate production inaccordance with the Technical DataPackage (TDP). The tree auger isdesigned to be screwed into wood forthe tactical emplacement of remotesensors.  The tree auger is a hexhead, stainless steel screwmeasuring .66 long with a thread sizeof .375.  The screw is welded into thecenter hole of the auger plate.  Thetree auger has one U shapedopening at both ends to allow forsensor or camera mount attachment.The camera mount is an L shapedbracket designed to attach to a treeauger, center stake or tripod assemblywith an electro-optical or infraredtactical remote sensor attached.  Thecamera screw assembly has a stainlesssteel threaded stud measuring 1.25 inlength with a thread size of .25.  Thetree auger knob is used to secure thecamera mount to the tree auger,center stake or tripod assembly.Intended Application of TreeAuger/Camera Mounts.  The tree augerand camera mounts are required tosupport the tactical deployment ofunattended remote sensor sets for aminimum of 120 days in outdoorenvironments within the temperaturerange of 30 to +62 degrees C.  Thetree auger will be screwed into woodand allow for external sensors orcamera mounts to be tacticallyconcealed.  The camera mount willattach to the tree auger, center stakeor tripod assembly and allow for theelecto-optical or infrared camera to betactically deployed with a fixed field ofview.  The assemblies ability to belightweight and man-packed to remotelocations is essential.  General DeliveryRequirements.  The TRSS TreeAuger/Camera Mount effort requiresthe manufacture of tree augers andcamera mounts, which are built inaccordance with a prescribed set ofProduct Drawings (Qualification andProduction only). The Governmentdesires both assemblies to be built perthe existing Product Drawing.  TheGovernment desires a QualityAssurance Plan to validate productionprocess and products.

DESCRIPTION
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is requesting information from Government, academic, and commercial organizations concerning fundamental research in quantum key distribution (QKD) over fiber-optic networks of continental extent.  The requested information is sought to determine the state of the art, current capabilities, and future possibilities for continental-scale QKD.  No funding has been allocated to this effort at this time.

INTRODUCTION
Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises to enable the generation of ultra-secure cryptographic keys between pairs of nodes on a fiber-optic network.  Implementing QKD over a continental-scale fiber-optic network could result in high pay-off for the Department of Defense (DoD). Recently, QKD has been demonstrated, at rates of the order of tens of secret bits per second, over dedicated optical fibers approximately one to two hundred km in length. Although QKD over such distances represents an impressive achievement, continental-scale fiber-optic networks will require distances that are greater by an order of magnitude.

PURPOSE
DSO requests information regarding the feasibility of quantum key distribution over a fiber-optic network extending over continental distances.  A simplified model of such a network is depicted in Figure 1, featuring network nodes (large dots) connected by 1000-km fiber-optic links.  Each fiber-optic link is equipped with quantum repeaters (small dots) located every 100 km.  The network nodes – where communications are initiated, received, and switched – are assumed to be located within physically secure sites, whereas the fibers and quantum repeaters are not.

<DESC>Army Research Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliances

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for new alliances in the technical areas of Robotics, Cognition and Neuroergonomics, and Network Science. In order for ARL to explore these scientific opportunities and fully comprehend the state of the art in these technical areas, an open workshop will be held at the Sheraton Reston in Reston, VA, beginning at 8:00 AM on Thursday, May 8, 2008, ending late afternoon on the same day.  Attendance at this workshop is not required to propose to any solicitation that may be published in the future as related to these technical areas.  In addition to listening to briefings and participating in discussions, workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in these three technical areas, further defined below. Individuals interested in presenting at the workshop should e-mail a brief presentation (no more than five (5) slides) to the meeting organizer, Ms. Renée Besanson (ACTA2008@sainc.com) no later than Friday, April 25, 2008.  Submissions should indicate clearly the technical area the presentation most fully addresses, as the majority of the workshop will involve presententations on the three technical areas concurrently. To insure broad coverage in a limited amount of time, no more than two (2) presentations from a single department or branch and no more than three (3) presentations from a single organization will be allowed.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all material that is presented is approved for public release by the organization that funded the research.  For general questions about the conference, please contact Ms. Besanson (ACTA2008@sainc.com, 703-797-4584).

Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA)


The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a new CTA on Robotics, addressing some of the fundamental scientific and technological underpinnings to enable the future deployment of highly autonomous unmanned systems, including ground, air, and surface vehicles, on the battlefield.  The workshop will consist of technical sessions in the areas of (1) perception, (2) intelligence, (3) human-robot interaction, (4) dexterous manipulation and unique mobility, and (5) integrated performance.  Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in Robotics and/or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative.  The presentation should address technical barriers in this area of robotics, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  

Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA)

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a new CTA on Cognition and Neuroergonomics, which aims to use a multi-dimensional approach (e.g., genetics, computational modeling, neuroimaging, and performance) to:  optimize information transfer between the system and the Soldier, identify mental states and individual differences that impact mission-relevant decision making, and develop technologies for individualized analyses of neurally-based processing in operational environments. The workshop will consist of technical sessions in the areas of (1) leveraging the capabilities inherent to the perceptual-motor system while minimizing limitations (2) understanding and leveraging the neural processes underlying complex decisions and (3) predicting and validating individual differences in neuro-cognitive processing in scenarios reflecting operational stressors.  Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in cognition and neuroergonomics and/or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  

Network Science Technology and Research Center of Excellence


The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a potential Network Science Technology and Research Center of Excellence consisting of four components: a Social Cognitive Research Center, a Sensor and Information Fusion Research Center, a Communications and Networking Research Center and an Integration Center for evaluation and analysis of research outputs and overall management of the Center of Excellence.

Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in the technical areas related to Network Science and Information Fusion or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative. The submissions for the presentations should address technical barriers in the areas pertaining to Network Science as described here, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  The workshop will consist of technical sessions pertaining to the following areas:

The Sensor and Information Fusion Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in sensor and information fusion with the aim of providing revolutionary enhancements to the way DoD exploits intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data for land warfare.   In order to reduce information and communications network overload, fusion of disparate data sources and information sources is essential.  The fusion work will exploit the full range of potential data sources including imaging and non-imaging sensors, communications, human reports, geospatial data, etc.  As part of the workshop, there will be discussions to identify critical technology enablers such as modeling and performance metrics of integrated network-fusion systems, and closed-loop networked architectures to address Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities.  

The Social Cognitive Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in how networks influence and are influenced by human behavior in the context of military decision making.  The workshop will cover how people interface with the network and the fusion products generated by the TCPED process, how they process situational information, especially its representation to humans and how they make military decisions under the stresses of combat.  This Center will also execute research in understanding of social networks as input to an overall fusion architecture.

The Communications and Networking Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to enhance the military communication infrastructure to enable a dynamic, wireless, mobile environment that supports a heterogeneous mixture of individual soldiers, ground vehicles, airborne platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics, and unattended ground sensor networks.  The research will investigate complex wireless infrastructure operating over noisy wireless channels with high levels of interference and jamming, while on-the-move with highly mobile nodes and mobile network infrastructure.  The environment for the network includes rapidly changing network topologies requiring automatic adaptation and self-configuration. There will be discussions on techniques to model (at sufficient fidelity and with sufficient scale), design, analyze, predict, and control the behavior of secure tactical communications, sensing, and command-and-control networks.  

The Integration Center will be jointly operated by personnel from the Center of Excellence and Government employees.  The primary functions of the Integration Center will be to evaluate and leverage research from the other three Centers as well as other research entities in a laboratory for network science to be collocated with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.  Performance evaluations by the Integration Center will be end-to-end to assess the performance of the information fusion, social cognitive, and networking as a system of systems.  In addition, the Integration Center will collaborate with the other three centers to engage with potential DoD and civilian agency customers to transition mature research products.

52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items. 
As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision: 

Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items
(Nov 2007) 

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. 

(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show— 

(1) The solicitation number; 

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 

(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 

(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 

(5) Terms of any express warranty; 

(6) Price and any discount terms; 

(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address; 

(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); 

(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 

(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 

(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 

(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 

(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 

(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 

(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 

(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 

(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

<DESC>DAPS e-Print Business Solution

The Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) is a defense activity under Defense Logistic Agency (DLA). DAPS provides document services to the Department of Defense with 176 facilities world-wide, DAPS employs over 750 government employees. Thirty-three of the 176 facilities are overseas. Services provided by DAPS include traditional offset printing, digital printing, digital services such as document scanning or CD-ROM replication, and electronic document management. DAPS processes over 3 million orders annually with annual sales for Fiscal Year 2006 of $370M.     

Print-Industry consulting companies forecast the use of web tools to continue to expand offering additional value added features for customers while offering streamlined production efficiencies for the production plant. DAPS’ current DAPS Online (DOL) system has reached its modification limits without a total rework of existing code. Future enhancements put the current DOL system at risk of stability and performance issues. For this reason DAPS seeks a robust, leading-edge next generation tool to replace its current DOL.

<DESC>Title:    Financial Ratings & Research Requirement

Response Date:     Five (5) business days from issuance

Description:

This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER/AWARD.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial subscription service prepared in accordance with  format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplementd with additional information included in this solicitation.  USAD intends to award a sole source purchase order to Fitch Information, Inc. (Fitch), One State Street Plaza, 33 Floor, New York, N.Y. 10001.  Fitch is the sole proprietor for Fitch Bank Analysis Services, and provides vital credit research, peer analysis, and industry and market reports.  Their service provides an opinion on the relative ability of an entity to meet its financial commitments such as interest, preferred dividends, repayment of principal, insurance claims, or counterparty obligations.

Fitch's credit ratings will be used by the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service as indications of the likelihood of receiving Government money back in accordance with the terms of which it invested.  Fitch's global ratings cover the global spectrum of corporate, sovereign, financial, bank, insurance, municipal and other public finance entities and the securitues or backed by receivables or other financial assets.  The use of credit ratings defines their functions: "investment grade" ratings (International Long term, 'AAA' to 'BBB'; Short-term, 'F1' to'F3') indicate relatively low to moderate credit risk, while those in the "speculative" or "non investment grade" categories (International Long-term, 'BB+' to 'D'; Short-term, 'B' to'D') either signal a higher level of credit risk in relative rank order, whichis to say they are ordinal measures of credit risk and are not predicative of a specific frequency of default or loss.

Fitch International credit ratings assess the capacity to meet foreign currency or local currrency commitments.  Both "foreign currency" and "local currency" ratings are international comparable assessments.  The company also provides Individual and Support ratings of banks, which pinpoint the likelihood that a bank will get into difficulties, and in that event, whether it will indeed receive external support.  The Foriegn Agriculture Service has utilized the professional credit rating servicesof Fitch for the past four years, with satisfactory results.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Executive Office for United States of Attorney’s (EOUSA) invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Investigational Auditor Services in the office of Chicago, IL.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by Monday, May 19, 2008, 2:00 pm (EST).   This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. The Contractor must provide the following information:

(1) Provide resumes of prospective personnel. The personnel will be the person expected to perform the tasks identified in the Scope of Work. The resume should reflect the personnel’s security clearance level, training and certifications, if any.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor’s experience demonstrating the contractor’s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541211.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.  

The Government estimated value of this contract is $347,000.00 for one base year and two 12 month option years.  The precise period of performance will be determined at the time of award.

<SUBJECT>develope science curricula for high schools and elementary/middle schools
<SOLNBR>NIHOD2008062
<CONTACT>Marcia  - Goldman, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-2302, Fax 301-402-3407, Email goldmanm@od.nih.gov
<DESC>DESC: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Science Education (OSE) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8 (a) firms to develop a curriculum supplement on evolution for high school (grades 9 -12) general biology classes and a curriculum supplement on rare diseases for science classes in grades 5 to 7. The intended procurement will be classified under SIC NAICS 611430 with a size standard of $6.5 million.
The offeror will develop two curriculum supplements – these are teacher’s guides to a week’s worth of lessons on the following science topics. One curriculum supplement will be for high school general biology classes on the basic concepts of evolution, and its prominence in life sciences research, and medicine. The lessons within the supplement will allow students to hone their critical thinking, communications and team work skills. The lessons will also highlight careers in the health and medical sciences. The other curriculum supplement will be for science classes in grades 5-7 and focus on basic science concepts related to rare diseases in our society. Students will experience the process of scientific inquiry and develop an enhanced understanding of the nature and methods of science as related to rare diseases. Studying rare anomalies of living organisms provides a window into their normal functions. The lessons will also develop students’ critical-thinking skills, and highlight the role of science and medicine in society and the relationship between basic science and personal and public health. 
Each curriculum supplement will be a teacher's guide consisting of 1) detailed instructions on conducting five classroom lessons, 2) masters for copying student worksheets and other paper-based resources used during the lessons, 3) a teacher's section on the scientific and critical thinking content, 4) a section detailing the pedagogical design of the lessons, 5) a section aligning the lessons to the National Science Education Standards (see www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses), 6) a section discussing how the lessons fit into common high school general biology curricula and science curricula at grades 5-7, and 7) a list of relevant references and resources.
The offerer will be required to 1) use the National Science Education Standards in designing and developing the supplement; 2) interact with NIH staff frequently throughout the contract period; 3) field test the lessons in schools that represent the intellectual and diversity spectrum found in secondary and elementary schools across the nation (test sites must include, but shall not be limited to, a high school and elementary school/middle school in the Washington DC metropolitan area); 4) develop a Web site to house PDF and HTML versions of the supplements including any multimedia components of the student lessons; and 5) provide a formatted copy of the final curriculum supplements in InDesign or Quark Express format including all linked images (as gray scale or cmyk, depending on how the image should print) ready for professional printing. 
NIH intends for the curriculum supplements to be freely reproduced for classroom use and to be freely distributed to educators across the nation. NIH does not intend for the materials to be used by any organization for sale or profit.
The core of the supplements will be a series of lessons that collectively fit into five 45-minute class periods. Laboratory and computer-based activities may be used when they will enhance the students' learning experience. However, all computer-based activities must have a paper-and-pencil alternative. The supplement's design must be consistent with other NIH curriculum supplements (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements). All materials developed for the curriculum supplements must be in two formats: print and Web ready. 
All multimedia must be Web ready and operable using Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browsers in Macintosh and Windows platforms. IBM Domino/Notes is OSE's primary Web server and the application for internal collaborative tasks. All Web development work by the offeror must run under Domino/Notes 7.0 CF (or above). Any database constructed for a student lesson must be designed using Lotus Notes. Each Web page of the final product must conform to the NIH Curriculum Supplement Series Web Style Guide (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements/styleguide).
It is critically important that all Web pages be in accordance with Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (1998). Prospective offerors must demonstrate extensive experience in designing 508-compliant Web pages and provide links to Web sites as proof of this expertise.   
The offeror must be a nationally recognized curriculum development organization with experience in producing high-quality, field-tested life science curricula for grades 9 - 12 and 5-7 that are currently being used in schools nationwide. The offeror must present a team with the following expertise: 1) life science curriculum developers and educators who have been successful in teaching a diverse range of students; 2) technical writers who are knowledgeable about biomedical issues; 3) specialists in state-of-the-art educational technologies; 4) scientists with experience in biomedical practices, biology and evolution and rare diseases; 5) Web developers/Multimedia specialists with proven experience working with IBM Domino/Notes and designing Section 508-compliant Web pages.
The offerer will design the supplements using a research-based, student-centered approach to instruction. The educational design philosophy of the supplement should be consistent with the National Science Education Standards and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy (see www.project2061.org/publications/bsl). The Standards and Benchmarks apply to all students, regardless of age, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in science. The supplements should emphasize how basic and clinical research contributes to our knowledge of diseases and leads to advances in healthcare. It should also illustrate the multiplicity of approaches to solving problems on scientific issues. The lessons should provide students with opportunities to understand basic and clinical research. They should be dynamic, engaging, and relevant to high school and elementary/middle school students. The offeror will indicate how the lessons will be tested and evaluated to assess their effectiveness in meeting the learning objectives. The offeror and OSE will meet frequently throughout the entire contract period to ensure that the supplement is scientifically accurate and that the lessons provide creative learning experiences applicable to all students nationwide. The offerer will present mechanisms for ensuring scientific accuracy using their own experts and include a plan for interacting with NIH scientists for content review. The offeror will also provide realistic timelines for development of the supplements and show thoughtful consideration for the needs of teachers with diverse student populations.
NIH intends to negotiate a multi-year contract for a period of two years, rather than a one-year contract with an additional one-year option. Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information. Any major proposed collaborations between the offerer and other entities must have been established prior to this survey and proven effective in producing high-quality science curricula that are currently being used in schools nationwide. If significant collaboration and subcontracting is anticipated to deliver technical capability, the offeror must show that they possess the administrative and management infrastructure to maintain full-time technical and managerial control of the project. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of a capability statement to the address above within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date this notice appears. Each firm must provide samples of curricular products
they designed and developed that are currently being used in the classroom. Firms should also include executive summaries of field tests or formal evaluations conducted for these materials. This market survey is being conducted through the Federal Business Opportunity Web site (see www.fedbizopps.gov) to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.

This is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is a Request for Quote.  The reference number is QA1330-08-RQ-04187 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-03.  The National Data Buoy Center intends to award a single purchase order for these items.  The following Statement of Work (SOW) provides contractor information necessary to prepare bids:

NDBC STANDARD SPECIFICATION FOR PROCUREMENT OF ACOUSTIC RELEASE 

1.0	SCOPE

1.1	PURPOSE
This specification contains the requirements for procuring an Acoustic Release including the compatibility requirement that the release must operate with the deck sets that are currently used for communicating with existing releases.  These releases are presently used extensively for the DART program and will soon be used in a developing ocean measurement program.
 
1.2	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
Any ambiguity or conflict between this specification and other applicable documents shall be resolved by the following order of precedence:

a)	The issued contract with any amendments or modifications
b)	This specification
c)	Other applicable documents

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	GENERAL
The acoustic release requirements and deck set compatibility requirements are covered separately below.  In order to preserve operational flexibility it is critical that the acoustic release and deck set are 100% compatible with each other and with existing NDBC inventory.

2.2	ACOUSTIC RELEASE

2.2.1	MECHANICAL
The entire acoustic release shall be comprised of single pressure housing with no external cables.  The pressure housing shall act as the in-line load bearing member with a minimum working load of 10,000 lbs.  The release shall not self-release under loading until at least 12,000 lbs of force are applied.   The depth rating of the pressure vessel shall be at a minimum 6000m.  The overall length of the instrument shall not exceed 40” and shall not weigh more than 65 lbs in salt water.  Preference will be given to a design that allows easy maintenance and battery exchange.  

All external features for the housing including hardware/fittings shall be corrosion resistant or adequately protected from corrosion with cathodic protection for a minimum of a 3 year deployment.  All external dissimilar metals shall be completely isolated from each another.  Preference will be given to external hardware that is corrosion free.  The release’s bottom flange must have a four bolt pattern on a 6.00 BCD sized for isolated 3/8” screws in order to ensure compatibility with existing equipment.  The upper attachment point of the release shall, at a minimum, be able to be connected to an isolated 5/8” Safety Anchor Shackle (Galvanized).

2.2.2	ACOUSTICS/ELECTRONICS
The instrument shall have a working range of at least 10 km and respond to interrogate frequencies in the range of 9-11 kHz (as ordered).  The release must be able to reply within the 7.5-15 kHz range and be adjustable in 500 Hz increments.  The transducer shall have a receive sensitivity of at least 80 dB re 1 micro Pa and provide a minimum reply source of 190 dB re 1 micro Pa at 1m.  The minimum pulse widths for interrogation and reply are 5 ms and 10 ms respectively.  The minimum turnaround response between interrogation and response shall be 13 ms.

The instrument shall respond to the following minimum commands; Enable, Disable, Release, each with a confirmation response from the instrument via a time ping-rate output.  The release shall be 100% compatible with the ORE (Edgetech) 8011A & 8011M Acoustic Command Deck Sets.  The Release command’s ping-rate shall be audibly (operator discernable) different from the other two commands.  Each release shall have an original and unique release code.  The acoustic release shall be equipped with a tilt sensor with a range of +/- 25 deg (Accuracy: +/- 5 deg) and be able to provide this information to the user during interrogation.  

2.2.3	POWER/BATTERIES
The release shall have an easily removable welded battery pack.  The capacity of the battery pack shall allow the instrument to remain deployed for a minimum of 2.5 years (150,000 replies).  The battery pack shall use alkaline based cells.  Vendors may present options for lithium based battery packs for longer duration deployments but these will not be a substitute for the above minimum power requirement.  The instrument shall be equipped with a vent/purge plug to allow the instrument to be purged upon recovery or filled with dry gas as desired.  The instrument shall be designed such that battery acid from damaged cells can not make contact with any internal aluminum components (if present) in order to reduce the potential of catastrophic hydrogen build up.  Battery packs shall be labeled with shelf life dates and dates of manufacture.  The vendor shall provide a quote of replacement battery packs in quantities of 1, 5, 10 and 20.

2.3	DECK SET COMPATIBILITY
The Acoustic Release must operate with the ORE (Edgetech) Models 8011A & 8011M Acoustic Command Deck Sets currently in use by the NDBC.

3.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DELIVERABLES

3.1 QUALITY ASSURANCE/TESTING
The vendor shall perform and provide proof of the following two tests (for the Acoustic Release) with results prior to delivery:

a)	Pressure Test:  The vendor shall perform a pressure test on all Acoustic Releases to the full extent of this specification.  In the event of a failure the vendor is allowed one opportunity to replace o-rings and repeat the test.  Units failing this second test will not be accepted.  The instrument must be held at the specified pressure for a minimum of 1 hour.

b)	Load Test:  The vendor shall perform an in-line load test on the Acoustic Release to ensure that the instrument meets the working load criteria in the test.  The instrument shall be loaded to the working load and held under load for a minimum of 5 minutes.  This test shall be performed on 20% of the delivered instruments at a minimum.

3.2 TESTIMONIAL QUALITY ASSURANCE
Prior to award the contractor shall provide NDBC with letters of recommendation from 4 contracts with details including number and type of units, along with contact information for the users.  It is preferred to have these testimonials in applications similar to that of NDBC’s long term deployment (>2 years) in deep water (5000m).

3.3 DELIVERABLES
The following items shall be provided at a minimum for each Acoustic Release that is purchased:

a)  Instrument including fresh internal Batteries (minimum remaining shelf life of 4 yrs)
b)  User Manual
c)  Service Kit (including at a minimum replacement seals and hardware along with necessary assembly tools)
d)  Ruggedized shipping container for marine applications for items a-c

<DESC>The National Data Buoy Center intends to negotiate only with Teledyne Benthos, Inc. of North Famouth, MA for 48 each Directional AM Transducers (8") with preamp electronics (P/N AT-421/9-14 KHz); 48 each ATM-88X 5410 DSP (P/N 008587); 48 each ATM-88X Bandpass PCB (P/N B-270-16) and 48 each Filters, low frequency, 9-14 KHz (P/N 009267).
In order to meet stringent power requirements for long term deployments, the DART acoustic modem PCBs must be highly configurable and user modifiable.  Benthos is the only known manufacturer of Acoustic Modem PCBs that allows NOAA the degree of control necessary to ensure that power use is minimized. Thus, the Benthos acoustic modem PCB are used in the current DART systems and are being procured to complete the remainder of the DART buoys, for future DART buoys, and for continuing DART support operations.  The firmware and drivers that control these modem functions are deeply embedded in the DART system design. 

The requested Benthos transducers and modem PCBs currently used in the DART system are the only components that can work in the system and as replacements on the deployed buoys.

Presently Benthos is the only known vendor that meets the requirements for the DART II program.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program  It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests

<RESPDATE>043008
<CONTACT>Scott F Doffek, Technical Advisor, Phone (310) 416-1509, Email scott.doffek@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a contract to Iridium for space situational awareness (SSA) analysis, not to exceed a period of performance from 2 June 2008 to 2 June 2009 (1 year).  Approximate value for this effort is estimated at $500K.
The intent is to award a sole source contract to Iridium under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This SSA study contract will support the analysis of capabilities and concepts within the context of the Iridium satellite constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  The study will address Size Weight & Power (SWaP) factors for hosting secondary payloads and technical means to provide timely precision global SSA coverage with assured data distribution and handling.  The Iridium constellation represents the most likely implementation to meet the above stated requirements.

The Government believes Iridium is the only company capable of providing the government's requirement for analysis and data/information that describes the current approach and concept of operations of the Iridium satellite service, without interruption in schedule or service, due to their unique knowledge of the Iridium satellite.  Award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the requirement and substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror's experience and knowledge of the Iridium constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have direct access and knowledge of the Iridium platform and full capabilities.  All interested parties must show capability to process and handle government equipment and information up to, and including SECRET.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: Ms. Kristy Kuhlman or e-mailed to kristy.kuhlman.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 1:00 P.M, PST, on 30 April 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC's.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses should be capable of meeting the above requirements at the time of submitting SOC's.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations regarding this acquisition to the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of white papers or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting officer, Ms. Ann Birbeck (310) 535-2634.

<DESC>Revision 4<BR>14 April 2008<BR>Q&A for RFI<BR>W9133L-08-NGBJ3RFI<BR><BR><BR>1.	Q:  RFI document states, walk away from the jet.  Does this statement mean your organization has definitely ruled out the potential use of twin engine turboprop aircraft such as the King Air 200 (C-12)?<BR><BR>A:  Misprint.  This has been corrected in the RFI.<BR><BR><BR>2.	Q:  Can you provide physical information (dimensions, weight & electrical requirements by major LRU, especially antennas) for the desired / anticipatedGround Penetration Radar, Foliage Penetration Radar and Mult-Spectral Sensors or the OEM POC info so we can determine what equipment would or would not likely fit in or under various aircraft<BR><BR>A:  The Government is seeking information concerning equipment currently fielded or available for fielding by industry. No specific systems have been identified.<BR><BR><BR>3.	Q:  When might the RFP for Contracted Aircraft Services to Support Domestic Operations be posted?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI for planningpurposes, and may or may not result in the issue of an RFP.  See cover page of RFI<BR><BR>4.	Q:  In reviewing the sources sought document, and what would appear to be dealing with classified equipment and data, would this require a Secret facility clearance to respond to the solicitation once it is released.<BR><BR>A:  If an RFP is released, the Government does not anticipate a classified solicitation. However, to perform a contracted service, a requirement for access to information classified up to US Secret is anticipated.  The Government does not anticipate generation, collection or storage of classified information.<BR><BR><BR>5.	Q:  It appears this operation may have been in place since 1994, is this a new requirement or is this a re-compete with a current incumbent.<BR><BR>A:  The Government is seeking information on industry ability to meet requirements for domestic operations utilizing contracted services.  Historically, the Government has not met these requirements through contracted services.<BR>6.	Q:  When is the industry day?<BR><BR>A:  The Government industry day is planned for 7 & 8 May 2008 in Crystal City, VA. Details should be posted soon.<BR><BR><BR>7.	Q:  Is there a current Statement of Work for this work?  Can you provide it?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI., a Statement of Work does not exist.<BR><BR><BR>8.	Q:  Is this anticipated to be a sole source or multiple award contract?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI.  See Cover Letter.<BR><BR><BR>9.	Q:  What is the anticipated start date of this contract?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI.  See Cover Letter.<BR><BR>10.	Q:  Will this effort require a quick reaction capability (QRC)?<BR><BR>A: Depending on the responses to this RFI, the Government may desire to address domestic response requirements through a contracted service. An 'Alert' type response capability is not anticipated as part of a possible solicitation. However, the Government welcomes industry insights to define QRC and information of any QRC capability that industry might have. <BR><BR><BR>11.	Q:  Is the list of essential equipment anticipated to be Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE), Contractor Acquired Property (CAP), or a combination thereof?<BR><BR>A:  The Government does not currently have mission equipment available to meet the Government requirements.  The Government seeks information from industry concerning equipment currently fielded by industry.  The Government also seeks information from industry concerning preferred equipment fielding options whether itis GFE, CFE, CAP or any combination of the above. The government welcomes information from manufacturers which could provide mission equipment as outlined in this RFI.  The Government welcomes information from industry under a teaming arrangement.<BR><BR><BR>12.	Q:  What are the operational requirements for this contract (i.e. basing locations, response times, number of aircraft, mission profiles, etc.)?<BR><BR>A:  At this time, the Government has no other requirements outside of the RFI.  The Government seeks to understand the ability of industry to support various requirements with contracted services by allowing industry to outline their current and/or proposed capabilities. <BR><BR><BR>13.	Q:  Will NGB require the contractor to administratively staff each basing location?<BR><BR>A:  The Government seeks information from industry on proposed basing solutions, tradeoffs, timelines, and contract structuring.<BR><BR><BR>14.	Q:  Will the aircraft be operating out of any military bases or civilian fields only?<BR><BR>A:  The Government seeks information from industry on proposed basing solutions, tradeoffs, timelines, and contract structuring.<BR><BR><BR>15.	Q:  We are working on the above SOL?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI.  See Cover Letter.<BR><BR><BR>16.	Q: Can you please define major population centers, as this will determine where aircraft are based?<BR><BR>A:  For purposes of this RFI, use city with a population of200,000 as a major population center.<BR><BR><BR>17.	Q: is the Response Date of Jun 01, 2008 5:00PM the same as the Sources Sought date?<BR><BR>A:  This is an RFI.  See Cover Letter.<BR><BR><BR>18.	Q:  By stating, Operate from civilian airfields of at least 5000' length with an operational control tower&, is the Government implying non-tower controlled fields or those with runways shorter than 5000' may not be used in operations?<BR><BR>A:  The statement is intended to provide a minimum aircraft performance requirement (at least 5000') and not a definition of specific operating locations.  However, the Government does not expect a requirement to operate from uncontrolled, unimproved or short fields.  The Government does expect operations from civilian airfields with 5000' runways. A contractor would be allowed to operate from any field within their own operational guidelines. <BR><BR><BR>19.	Q:  Are hyperspectral sensors included in the class of interest indicated as multispectral sensors?<BR><BR>A:  See revised RFI.<BR><BR>20.	Q:  Must the requirement to operate from runway length of 5000 feet be met at the worst case environmental conditions of 120 degrees and 5000 feet MSL at full gross weight?<BR><BR>A:  Not full gross weight.  Aircraft gross weight wouldbe dictated by the fuel necessary to meet the stated duration times while carrying the 3 Government observers.<BR><BR><BR>21.	Q:  Reference the statement, Carry at least one Government liaison and two Government observers during flights is the liaison or one of the observers the Mission Systems Operator?  We need to know the total number of people that will be on the flights, including the contractor crew.<BR><BR>A:  No.  The Government liaison or observers will not be part of the crew or operate any mission equipment.  <BR><BR><BR>22.	Q:  Reference the statement, - Hard point with access to aircraft power to carry Government furnished sensor, we need details such as size, weight, power and drag so that we can develop the hard point and determine aircraft size.<BR><BR>A:  Deleted in revised RFI.<BR><BR><BR>

Daugherty Conference Center, located at 22111 Three Notch Road, Lexington Park, MD 20653, from 8:00am until 4pm.  All parties who are interested in attending the industry day forum must pre-register by emailing Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the addresses set forth above.  Registering parties must include the name, company, telephone number and email address of the individual/s who will attend.  Telephone registration requests WILL NOT be accepted.
