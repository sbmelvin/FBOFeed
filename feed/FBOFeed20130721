<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), Division of Microbiology's (DM) genomics program has several Illumina MiSeqs (Illumina Catalog Number SY-410-1001) instruments that are used for its Next-Generation Sequencing program. The MiSeqs are used for automated generation of DNA clonal clusters by bridge amplification, sequencing, and primary and secondary analysis. The systems include an embedded touchscreen monitor, on-instrument computer, and MiSeq Software Suite. Two of these instruments require annual preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance.</p>
<p>PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide preventive and corrective maintenance services for two Illumina MiSeqs (Illumina Catalog Number SY-410-1001) instruments.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks and provide the following deliverables. The Contractor shall provide preventive and corrective maintenance on two Illumina MiSeqs (Illumina Catalog Number SY-410-1001) instruments equal to or better than Illumina's Standard MiSeq Service plan (Illumina Catalog Number SV-420-1002). The FDA Contracting Officer's Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) will approve all tasks and deliverables.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following preventive and corrective maintenance on-site at CFSAN's College Park, MD facility (CPK1, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740), unless otherwise indicated:</p>
<p>Comprehensive preventive maintenance services. The Contractor shall perform at least two preventive maintenance service visits per year. Each visit shall include the following: <br />Evaluation of all motion systems and optics.<br />Inspection of fluidics lines and the chip station for salt residues.<br />Priming of reagent lines and performance of volume and thermal ramp tests (every year or six months), as necessary.<br />Inspection of sipper tubes for residues causing blockages to verify appropriate suction. <br />Examination of the wash history to verify proper wash schedules have been maintained.<br />Performance of full optics, y stage, M3 mirror, compensator, z stage, LED power, and tip/tilt tests.<br />All necessary hardware and software updates, including Illumina proprietary software updates and particularly updates that improve the interpretation of sequencing base calls for amplicons, genomes, and metagenomes which shall be installed and validated.</p>
<p>Corrective maintenance services by delivering unlimited technical support and troubleshooting assistance throughout the period of performance of the order. The Contractor shall perform the technical support and troubleshooting assistance on-site, except when the Contractor can provide this support off-site with the approval of the TPOC when off-site support is most practical and effective. Off-site support may include email and telephone support for instrument applications and bioinformatics issues and access to online training support modules. The Contractor shall respond to the FDA's technical support and troubleshooting requests within 24 hours of the FDA's initial request to the Contactor for assistance and shall provide on-site support within five days of the initial request for services. The Contractor may be permitted to respond initially to the FDA's inquiries for assistance by phone, email, or live-chat interface.</p>
<p>All preventive and corrective maintenance shall be performed by trained, skilled, and experienced Illumina certified and licensed service engineers following original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications, manuals, policies, procedures, and service bulletins, using OEM-certified tools and replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc., where applicable. The Contractor shall ensure any remaining warranty provided by Illumina is not voided. In particular, the Contractor shall warrant replacement parts to conform to Illumina's specifications for 90 days from date of installation, and the Contractor shall have access to and use proprietary Illumina upgrades.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The FDA anticipates a base period of one year with four one year options. For each option period, the Contractor shall perform the same tasks and produce the same deliverables as delineated in the base period. The FDA anticipates an award date on or around August 26, 2013.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall propose a demonstrated technical understanding of MiSeq fluidics, cluster generation, reagent chemistry, and flow cell issues and provide Illumina certified and licensed service engineers with documented evidence that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the above described preventive and corrective maintenance on the MiSeq instruments. The Contractor shall have access to and utilize Illumina proprietary upgrades. <br /><br />Place and Time of Performance:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform all on-site maintenance service at CFSAN's facilities located at 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740, unless otherwise indicated by the FDA's TPOC. The Contractor shall perform all on-site maintenance service during the hours of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm ET, Monday through Friday, unless otherwise indicated by the TPOC. The Contractor shall coordinate scheduling preventive and corrective maintenance visits with the TPOC and shall only perform these services at a time approved by the TPOC. The Contractor shall anticipate performing a preventive maintenance visit within five days of the effective date of the order.</p>
<p>Pricing and Payment:</p>
<p>This requirement is anticipated to be a firm-fixed-price order, inclusive of all costs, such as labor, materials, parts, and travel costs, with firm-fixed-price payment upon completion of the base and each option period, if the FDA decides to exercise the particular option.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>The FDA is requesting interested qualified small businesses to provide a capability statement showing their ability and willingness to complete this requirement electronically to Dan Feldman at daniel.g.feldman@fda.hhs.gov in a commonly used format, such as Microsoft Word or pdf.

<p>1. Statement of Need <br />Software bugs (bugs) often create vulnerabilities because they cause software to behave differently than intended. The software might crash, making it unavailable, or consume all available resources, or cause other unpredictable consequences. In the worst case, an attacker might be able to trigger the bug in a special way such that he or she can run his or her own instructions. Some bugs are exposed and fixed during the testing phase of a software development process. The bugs that slip past the testing phase without being found and fixed are unknown vulnerabilities and can be triggered, sometimes with catastrophic results, after the product release.</p>
<p>The best way to discover unknown vulnerabilities is Fuzzing, a negative software testing method that feeds a program, device or system with malformed and unexpected input data in order to find defects. Malformed, anomalous input such as overflow, underflow or repetition trigger a vulnerability in software, causing for example crashes, denial of service (DoS), security exposures or performance degradation. The test target is carefully monitored during testing to detect the failures. When software is fuzz tested proactively, vulnerabilities can be found and fixed before deployment, resulting more secure and robust, high quality software. Fuzz tested product has less critical vulnerabilities that need to be patched. This means less cost from patch development and release, and product recalls.</p>
<p>FDA is developing a cybersecurity laboratory in which a fuzz testing capability is to be integrated.</p>
<p>FDA is seeking commercial Fuzz testing tools and the Defensics product line from Codenomicon is one of the best on the market since it provides both ongoing support in the form of updated scripts but also because it generates a top quality output report with the results of every test outlined and the possible mitigations for the vulnerability listed.</p>
