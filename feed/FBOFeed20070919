<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to I-Site 3D Laser Imaging of Lakewood, CO, for I-Site Version 3.0 3D Laser Scanning Software.  Noncompetitive award is being made because I-Site Version 3.0 is state of the art 3-D laser scanning software that is used to process data from the Riegl 3D scanner to produce extremely high resolution and accurate terrain models of complex or hard to map surfaces.  The I-Site Version 3.0 software is unique to this application in that it is the only maker of high-resolution 3-D modeling software that can interface with a variety of sensors and perform a spherical-surface generation that is necessary to model overhanging and other highly complex coastal cliff morphology data.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contract Specialist by e-mail (rpaprocki@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>U. S. Government Seeking Expressions 
Of Interest for Assignable Land Option
In Dallas, TX


General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking expressions of interest from fee title owners, or their duly authorized representatives, wanting to participate in an assignable option to purchase a site, or an assemblage of properties for a lease construction project.  This expression of interest is for the SITE ONLY.  

GSA hereby solicits a no-cost assignable option to purchase property or the donation of a site.  Offered properties must be within the following delineated area:

Bounded by:

N:  Red Bird Lane
E:  S. Polk St.
S:  S. Westmoreland Ave. to W. Wheatland Rd. to Old Hickory    Trail and Old Hickory Tail to E. Danieldale Rd. to S. Polk St.
W:  S. Westmoreland

		
Site shall be zoned for commercial office facilities and shall not be in a floodplain.  Proposed parcels of land shall yield acreage to sustain approximately 23,962.55 rentable square feet/20,837 ANSI BOMA usable square feet (USF) of office space along with 145 parking spaces.  

Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Primary consideration in selecting boundaries will be accessibility by public and private transportation for the greatest number of people in the service area.  

Sites which are located directly on a highway or 6-lane thoroughfare will not be considered in the following instances: (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either directions within a block; (2) if the location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed space. Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Primary consideration in selecting boundaries will be accessibility by public and private transportation for the greatest number of people in the service area.

In support of GSA's Brownfield initiative, we will consider abandoned, idled, or underused commercial sites where redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.  The Seller shall provide any existing environmental information available for the site.  In addition, the seller shall advise if there are any historic structures on or in the immediate area of the site and if there are any known archaeological resources on or near the site.  

In compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act and Executive Order 13006, when operationally appropriate and economically prudent, the Government will consider historic buildings and sites within historic districts.  Demolition of historic buildings in anticipation of Government use may disqualify an offeror from consideration.
Additional information is available at http://www.gsa.gov/historicpreservation or by contacting GSA at the address listed below.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction.  In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.  Fee title owners, or their duly authorized representatives, are invited to submit expressions of interest via e-mail, facsimile or first class mail, specifying the address and legal description of the property to:

<SUBJECT>A -- Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST)
<SOLNBR>BAA07-64
<RESPDATE>110607
<ARCHDATE>12062007
<CONTACT>Peter Haaland, Program Manager, STO, Phone 703-248-1517, Fax 703-807-4971, Email BAA07-64@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) program will develop systems  that permit exhaustive, accurate, and economical collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping of urban and military environments.  The system, which integrates three technical components, will demonstrate materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities whose concentration ranges from 10 parts per trillion to 100 parts per million by volume from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas in less than five minutes.  In the second phase, a complete system that weighs less than one kilogram including power, indexing for one hundred samples, and GPS geolocation will be demonstrated. 

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following Areas of Interest:

Technical Area One: Hyperadsorptive materials
A central objective of the program is the quantitative, efficient and exhaustive collection of trace gases from the atmosphere.  Media such as nanophase powders, aerogels, dendrimers, aerosils, zeolites, and porous solids may bind species whose atmospheric concentration is as low as ten parts per trillion or as high as one percent while failing to bind the primary constituents whose concentration exceeds one percent.  Quantitative collection means that the atmospheric concentration of a gas can be inferred from the amount of material that is collected by hyperadsorbent media and subsequently analyzed in a laboratory.  Efficient materials will accomplish this sampling using minimal masses and volumes of adsorbent and atmospheric gas, and will reject binding of the primary atmospheric constituents nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor.  Exhaustive collection implies that diverse atmospheric traces including organic, acid, halogen, noble, and organometallic vapors will be collected. 

Technical Area Two: Packaging
Systems that automatically sample atmospheric species for subsequent analysis must be packaged so that media are kept free of contamination except when they are deliberately exposed to sample the atmosphere.  Packaging must also ensure that media remain fresh before exposure to air and stable subsequent to sample collection without cross-contamination. 

Technical Area Three: Analyte Extraction
New approaches to sample extraction from adsorbent media are sought to mitigate the impacts of chemical reaction during extraction that are inherent to the existing technologies based on thermal desorption or organic solvent extraction.

Award will be made relative to best overall value.  Best value will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) delivery schedule; (iii) price; (iv) warranty; and (v) past performance. All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerâs specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a solicitation. This announcement is a follow-on to FBO Special Notice dated May 14, 2007 solicitation number DG133E-07-RP-0068. 

A. Background 
1. 	On March 21, 2007 NOAA posted a pre-solicitation notice (reference number: NE-EK000-5-00033) that identified a revised GOES-R acquisition approach for the procurement of space and ground systems for the GOES-R satellite.  This notice explained how NOAA awarded contracts for the Preliminary Design and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase of GOES-R to three contractor teams in anticipation of a single contract for the spacecraft, ground system, and system integration.  However, the Government determined that the spacecraft and ground system will be procured separately.  The PDRR contracts ended April 20, 2007, and NOAA and NASA are proceeding with their separate procurements.  NOAA will retain overall program management responsibility, acquire the ground system, operate the system following satellite launch, and will be responsible for algorithm development.  NASA will award the spacecraft contract, continue to award the instrument contracts, and acquire the launch vehicle under a separate contract.  The GOES-R Program office will manage overall systems engineering and integration.

2. 	On May 14, 2007 NOAA posted a Special Notice (solicitation number: DG133E-07-RP-0068) related to the GOES-R Ground Segment (GS) in which NOAA requested information from potential prime offerors and small business/small disadvantaged business/women and/or veteran owned businesses/hubzone businesses. Contractors who did not submit a response to the request for information (dated May 14, 2007) are not precluded or prohibited from participating in the GOES-R GS acquisition. 

B. Information for Potential Offerors
	1. 	The Government has reviewed and consolidated questions received in response to the May 14, 2007 Special Notice (solicitation number: DG133E-07-RP-0068).  The Governments responses to these questions are provided in an Excel document as an attachment to this announcement. This document is also available through the NOAA GOES-R Program Office Web site at http://osd.goes.noss.gov/ac.php. Please send questions related to the GOES-R GS that have not been addressed by this notice to Kelly Mabe, Contracting Officer, at kelly.mabe@noaa.gov and Mary Petruzzo, Contract Specialist, at mary.petruzzo@noaa.gov. 

	2. 	In an effort to promote early interaction among interested vendors, the Government will utilize the FBOs Interested Vendors Module (Bidders List) to promote teaming opportunities. Vendors are advised to read the FBO Vendors Guide for information on this module. The FBO Vendors Guide is available at http://www1.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG1-Index.html. The Contracting Officer intends to publish the list of interested vendors at which time all of the information supplied in the registration form (company name, contact information, etc.) will be published on the FBO site. The Government strongly encourages interested vendors to utilize this module.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome, NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with L-3 ASIT, 613 Global Way, Linthicum Heights, MD, 21090 for the following items: Cable Assemby for DRT (1), DF Antenna Array (2), Interface Cable Assembly for DRT Interface (1), and DRT Operation Software Licenses (2). Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334220.

Sole Source Justification: 

AFRL/IFEC requires the above requested items to be added as components to a Digital Receiving Technology (DRT) portable receiving direction finding antenna system. The system is in use at AFRL for research and development under in house efforts for Network Centric Exploitation and Tracking (N-CET) and Simulated Communications (SIMCOMM). These exact components are required in order to ensure compatibility. If other components were used in the existing DRT equipment, an inordinate amount of cost and effort would have to be expended to design and configure the software to hardware interface. L-3 ASIT is the only source that manufactures and distributes the necessary components for the large scale Portable Receiving System.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 with Thales Communications, Inc., 22605 Gateway Center Dr., Clarksburg, MD, 20871, for 1 Enhanced Multiband Inter/Intra Team tactical handheld radio (MBITR) and accessories. There are no other sources for this radio. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: 

Aside from the radio?s unique capabilities, it is the first and currently only Joint Tactical Radio System Software Communications Architecture certified handheld radio. AFRL has ongoing networking capabilities development programs based on Thales? MBITR, and purchase of the radio is necessary for compatibility. To use another company?s item would result in a loss of test capability; other offerings are not as capable at the same cost.

The services shall consist of but, are not limited to, the care, servicing, inspection, detection and correction of mechanical discrepancies before these discrepancies can cause serious damage, failure or injury. The ninety-seven generators at the location, which range in sizes from 3.5 kW to 750 kW (Prime), are diesel powered. The Contractor shall be responsible for performing the work required by the Statement of Work located in Section C of the resultant contract. Any interested parties, please contact Mr. Kelly Lynch via email at Kelly.Lynch@dhs.gov for an electronic copy of the solidification by noon time on 20-September-2007. Basis for 

Award: Offerors shall submit a list of current and past contracts (with points of contacts) dating back three years in which the Offerors performed similar work as to the requirement being listed by FEMA identifying whether the Offeror was a Prime or Sub-Contractor. FEMA will utilize the provided information to determine if the Offeror or Offerors are technically qualified to accomplish the required task. The Offerors will be evaluated on: 

(1) Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' and critical team members demonstrated past performance in delivering quality products and services and in meeting technical, cost/price, and schedule requirements on similar programs; and to determine that the Offeror demonstrates the application of systemic improvement management practices and minimizing life cycle costs. The Past Performance risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant past performance. Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist. However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement. The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated. Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated. In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown. 

(2) Technical Qualification: The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' and critical team members' experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work. The Government will also evaluate the extent of relevant benefits (if any) that the Offeror gained from each contract/subcontract reference identified and how they relate to the task areas of the statement of work. The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience. 

(3) Price:  The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror can successfully complete the requirement at its proposed price.

Award will be made on Best Value Basis to Government. Quotes must be priced on F.O.B. Destination. Interested organizations may submit their quotes via email to Kelly Lynch at Kelly.Lynch@dhs.gov, no later than 12 Noon Eastern Standard Time (EST), on September 24, 2007.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis with StemCell Technologies, 570 West Seventh Avenue, Suite 400, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1B3 for the RoboSep- Fully Automated Cell Separator, which includes, (4) Four ? The Big Easy? EasySep magnet, lid, carousel, power cable, service rack, hydraulic fluid bottle and tubing, calibration rig software, protocol editor software, cross-over Ethernet cable, sixteen RoboSep tips, user manual, shipping crate, on-site visit for installation and one year parts and labor warranty to reproductively isolate hematopoietic sub-populations, including stem cells, with a minimum of DNA/cellular damage. An automated cell separation system satisfies these requirements while avoiding the need for a more expensive flow cytometer. RoboSep is fully automated and the more automated the system, the higher likelihood that sample to sample variation will be reduced. RoboSep offers the best chance for reproducibility and is significantly less expensive than other cell separation systems.

The primary tasks anticipated under this contract include developing Basic Facility Requirements (BFR) documents and performing Engineering Evaluations: Basic Facility Requirements (BFRs) are developed to determine what facilities are required to perform the assigned mission. The contractor will calculate BFRs by Category Code, Special Area, and Host and its tenants for each site. BFRs are the result of an analysis of projected mission and base/tenant loading, operational considerations, activity and surrounding community conditions, and sound professional judgment. BFRs are intended to be the minimum facilities necessary for efficient operation and are not directly constrained by anticipated funding levels, individual operational priorities or inefficiencies in existing facilities. An Engineering Evaluation (EE) is an on-site inspection of an Activitys buildings and structures that is performed jointly by the contractor and the activity.  During an EE, existing facilities are inspected to verify current occupancy, floor areas and usage, and to assess their ability to satisfy designated present uses.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate a contract with The University of South Florida to continue serving as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Youth Study (TEDDY), an ongoing epidemiological study involving international clinical centers which are subcontractors to the DCC. The goal of TEDDY is identification of infectious agents, dietary factors, or other environmental agents, including psychosocial factors which trigger type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in genetically susceptible individuals or which protect against the disease. Identification of such factors will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. Data collection is ongoing from cohorts of newborns from the general population and newborn first-degree relatives of probands with T1DM. Newborns are first identified to be at genetic risk for T1DM before being offered enrollment for long term follow-up. These cohorts are to be followed for 15 years for the appearance of various beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes, with documentation of early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors. The TEDDY study will include 5,940 neonates recruited from the general population with a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 3% and 1,152 neonates with first degree relatives who have type 1 diabetes and who have a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 10%. Thus, the study will follow a total of 7,092 participants across multiple clinical centers worldwide (both in Europe and in North America). The participants will be followed with blood sampling every three months for islet autoantibody measurements until age 4 years and then every six months until the age of 15, for a total of 95,742 samples over the first 5 years of the study and a total of 269,496 over the entire study. 

The DCC provides biostatistical and operational expertise and advice to the clinical centers and the NIDDK and will include the following tasks: 1) Study-Wide Communications, Dissemination of Study Materials, and Related Activities; 2) Data Management and Records Maintenance; 3)Clinic and Central laboratories Monitoring; 4)Data Analyses; 5)Preparation of Study Report and Papers for Publication; 6)Implementation of Procedures to Evaluate Management, Methodology, and Cost-Effectiveness of Procedures Utilized by the DCC; and 7)Periodic Meetings. 

Ongoing TEDDY assessments include: HLA typing-the criteria for enrollment into the study, and analysis of autoantibodies- the primary endpoint of the study. In addition there are follow up visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48 months of age; with subsequent visits every six months and blood samples are taken at each visit. The parents collect monthly stool samples in early childhood. The parents also fill out questionnaires at regular intervals in connection with visits. TEDDY study personnel complete charts at each visit. The parents record events in the child?s TEDDY Book. Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active TEDDY participants will provide important scientific information on early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors.

The University of South Florida has served as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for TEDDY since 2002.  All procedures necessary for data collection, editing, and processing; and for the maintenance of permanent study files and documentation related to the TEDDY database are implemented by the DCC staff as specified in the Internal Procedures Manual and in accordance with HIPAA regulations. The DCC professional and technical staff includes the principal investigator, epidemiologists, database manager, statisticians, programmers, technology and web support, research assistants, nutritionists and administrative specialists, and data entry clerks.

The DCC utilizes the computing infrastructure of the University of South Florida (USF). The DCC is connected redundantly to the USF Wide Area Network. This network provides a 1 GB connection to the Commercial Internet as well as a 155 MB connection to Internet 2. The internal layer three server network is purely switched and consists of high end Cisco and Foundry network equipment operating at 1GB/s. All server architecture is connected redundantly to the switch fabric in order to maintain high availability of the systems. The DCC computing facility is a self supporting, secure facility comprised of a highly redundant primary server room as well as a secondary Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity facility located at a geographically separate location. All core production systems including but not limited to web servers, database servers, e-mail systems and network architecture are implemented in threes two redundant systems at the primary data center and a third at the DR facility. The DCC has developed a web application for the TEDDY study which provides for data collection, specimen collection and tracking, subject management, accrual reports, data compliance reports, and TEDDY study staff and committee communications. This web application was developed in Microsoft .NET using C#.NET and ASP.NET. The architecture of the application is multi-tiered with separate layers for data access, business logic, and the graphical user interface. This application communicates with an Oracle database to store all of the TEDDY data. This infrastructure provides one of the most secure and stable platforms available in the industry. 

All the TEDDY study data is transmitted electronically. The DCC receives and processes data from forms completed by Study Coordinators for the participants during the TEDDY clinic visits, the diet records and forms from the nutritionists during TEDDY clinic visits, data from the autoantibody and HLA laboratories and the repositories.  The forms and data are sent electronically and transmitted via secure data streams using 128-bite encrypted traffic between the clinical centers, laboratories and the DCC. The web server and database used by the DCC are located behind dually redundant firewalls. The website and database themselves are password protected. Access to the application and data requires authentication of the logged-on user and access to data further depends on the users pre-assigned level of access.

The DCC has implemented an automated fax-in data collection system called Verity Teleforms. Study centers can download preformatted paper forms from the study websites as PDFs. The PDFs are then printed and data can be collected on the paper forms. The forms are then faxed into the DCC and the Teleforms system. This product permits the transfer of data from paper forms to databases and applies intelligent recognition to interpret written data on the form and direct them to the appropriate database.  Laboratory data files and other data files are either uploaded through the study website or are sent via ftp to the DCC. Laboratory processing is in place to automatically process the data as it is uploaded. In some cases the DCC may receive database exports from other institutions to analyze as well. 

The DCC web collaboration toolset provides a secure portal where Principal Investigators, Study Coordinators, and other study support staff may post and review documents, announcements, and link to the protocol manager application, training, and other collaboration tools provided by the DCC.

The DCC maintains three enterprise SAS servers for data analysis. The systems allow the DCC to dynamically allocate computing resources for analysis based on need. This structure permits reporting and analysis to be done in the most efficient manner possible. PC SAS is also used within the DCC for various less computing intensive applications. Additional SAS servers can rapidly be deployed based on demand. The DCC also maintains staff with enterprise data mining and artificial intelligence expertise to address analysis that requires these technologies.

The DCC has developed the Protocol Manager data collection and protocol management system that identifies and tracks all events specified in a research protocol. Events include: eligibility determination, registration, clinical activities and assessments (e.g., physical exam, medical history), laboratory testing or other investigative procedures, patient self-assessments, and structured patient interviews. A schedule of events specific to the protocol is created for each subject, and the status of each event is tracked for completion status. Additionally, this system can import laboratory and other data, and manage subject events that are dependent upon test results (e.g., laboratory tests that determine eligibility or establish sub-populations requiring additional follow-up). The protocol management system operates within a secure Web site, where study updates are posted periodically.  Research staff and investigators can access a secure area on the Web site to obtain data views specially designed to aide them in their roles and responsibilities on the study. Views can be limited by study site or role, protecting subject data. The system incorporates data standards such as SNOMED CT and RxNorm when they exist. 
This system also enables high data quality. The DCC helps with the design of the data collection forms (incorporating relevant data standards), and has incorporated checks to minimize transcription and omission errors. They develop regular Quality Assurance reports that assess data quality post-data entry. They have set up interactive data entry validation that enables the correction of data errors at the source of data collection, and limits the need for correcting data at the audit or analysis phases of a study. 

The DCC has set up the Lotus Sametime Web Conferencing System for use. The system is web based and provides application desktop sharing as well as desktop video and audio. The system is based on standard network protocols and used regularly as a collaboration tool to enhance phone conferences and also to provide a mechanism for interactive training at a distance.

The DCC has also set up a Media and Training Center on-line whereby study support staff can receive video and text based training on the suite of tools provided by the DCC as well as adverse events, data standards, and study specific training such as, but not limited to, how to accurately fill out a given form or interview with a subject. Training can be broadcast and recorded live at the DCCs training facility or can be recorded elsewhere and placed online by the DCC staff. The system provides a detailed tracking and reporting system so that study PIs and coordinators can track who has received training online. The system is capable of streaming a host of video and audio formats including, but not limited to: Microsoft Streaming Video, RealPlayer, Apple Quick Time, and MPEG.

The data collected on-line, whether by on-line entry or teleforms, goes into an Oracle database.  Several macros are then run through SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) to create Oracle tables that mimic the data forms collected. These tables, along with others created in Oracle, are then used by the statisticians and SAS programmers to extract data for analysis. Once an analysis is requested, by a clinical center, committee, investigator, etc., the statisticians use SAS to conduct the analysis. There are several different procedures used within SAS depending on the analysis requested (e.g. FREQ, UNIVARIATE, GLM, REPORT, PHREG, etc.). Once an analysis is completed it is sent to the requestor (and any other appropriate personnel) for review. Occasionally an analysis may also be done using SQL statements either in Oracle of SAS. These statements allow the creation of tables that can be analyzed as well. The reports/analyses are then posted to the TEDDY website under the appropriate area (General Reports, clinical center, committee, etc.). 

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) has a significant role in the operation of TEDDY. TEDDY is a complex project that requires extensive amounts of coordination of individuals and organizations that are nationally and internationally based. In addition to coordination of large meetings, the administrative staff is charged with report preparation and travel arrangements. As the accrual target for the study is 220,000 screened and 7,092 followed, the DCC will acquire extensive amounts of data for entry, analysis, reporting and publication. Database development and management is a critical function of the DCC as the volume of materials managed is so vast. Project staff for the Data Coordinating Center is divided into different areas: biostatisticians, epidemiologists, nutritionists, computer programmers, statistical programmers, database engineers and analysts, data managers. The DCC has to develop statistical designs for epidemiological studies, development and testing of predictive models for disease progression and provide direct logistical support for their implementation. The DCC is involved in overseeing subcontracting process for reference laboratories and sets policies and procedures for banking samples and data in accordance with the Institutes, Cosponsors and Steering Committee. The DCC has to review all manuscripts and abstracts. The biostatisticians have to address issues related to multiple end points (e.g., the occurrence of autoantibodies as well as diabetes), the evaluation of surrogate biomarker endpoints and multiple comparisons. The epidemiologists have to focus on several proposed studies involving both prospective and/or retrospective case-control designs, as well as genetic and gene-environment interactions and assess the prevalence and incidence of disease-related end point. The epidemiologists have to be involved with protocol development, preparation of request of proposals for reference labs and organize the manual of operations. They are responsible for organizing the process by which data is electronically transferred from reference laboratories. They have to FTP, import, and process data from remote laboratories. They are responsible for logging in receipt of data, checking files for reporting and/or transmission errors and reconcile with laboratories. The epidemiologists have to answer lab correspondence regarding problem samples, provide extensive phone contact with Clinical Centers (respond to inquiries regarding results, subject status reports, timing of tests/windows, and requests for materials, diagnosis determination, and other protocol related questions.). The epidemiologist has to assist with management reports, quality control reports and study documentation, prepare reports for project committees and proofread packets being sent to the clinical centers: including Specimen Transmittal Forms, Screening Forms, and various reports. The epidemiologists has to assist with preparation of material related to the Institutional Review Board, maintain the IRB approval files from all participating Clinical Centers and their affiliates as appropriate and perform as liaison between IRB and the Principal Investigators. The nutritionist has to coordinate collection dietary data from United States and international centers and advice and provide training, as well as perform quality control of the subject interviews and interact widely with the clinical centers and/or clinical investigators to see that protocol compliance meets research standards and remains high. The nutritionist has to develop instructions and advice materials for food portion size estimates as well as the adaptation of the questionnaires of the dietary forms for the different languages. The computer programmer has to work collaboratively with biostatisticians, scientific investigators, and data managers to design and manage research studies and has to be responsible for database design and development. The computer programmer is responsible for the development and implementation of systems for data entry and database driven webpage development The programmer has to provide the backend server support necessary to maintain the study domain and the system of password controls over data access and supervise the programming staff during the implementation of the TEDDY website, online data collection forms and security procedures. The computer programmer analyst has to maintain the Visual Basic/.Net front-end to the Consortium database including daily and weekly automated processes, end-user issues, data flow in and out of database, data integrity and quality control, and database development. The analyst has to maintain and update DCC main website as well as DCC's secure committee access sites as well as provide back-end support for a web-based system that allows institutions to request materials necessary for IRB approval and maintain the IRB database. The analyst has to maintain the TeleForms data-entry system for hard copy data entry and aid in the planning of the design of the Oracle backend database, implement the common framework used throughout the project. The statistical programmer has the responsibility for developing study management reports dealing with accrual, enrollment, and data quality which is an extensive undertaking. The statistical programmer has to develop reports for each TEDDY committee and for the External Advisory Committee and at the same time work on SAS tools to make the data more accessible to TEDDY investigators. The programmer has to deal with quality assurance and data completeness so that the study can monitor whether there is adequate follow-up, shipping is occurring in a timely fashion and whether the reference laboratories are performing as contracted. The database engineer is responsible for implementing the protocol. The engineer has to design data systems including data collection systems, databases, reports, maintenance systems, and access interfaces for users such as biostatisticians, investigators, and data managers. The engineer has to implement the database management systems, including Visual Basic, Oracle, automated forms technologies (Teleforms), data collection (entry), storage, reporting, and backup systems, user interfaces and access methods. The database programmer has to focus on the tabulation of data and the provision of online tools as well as develop and implement online data tools to assist investigators in access to the data and the formulation of data queries that can lead to insights into the developing data sets. The database programmer has to produce standard reports on protocol accrual, compliance and outcomes as well as facilitate the implementation of protocol data quality monitoring systems. The research associates are responsible for providing shipping supplies to all the clinical centers for items shipped to the Autoantibody Reference Labs, the HLA Reference Lab, and for all stool sample shipping.

Clinical Centers There are 6 clinical centers that are subcontracted to collect the subjects for the TEDDY study and are paid on per subject basis. They are as follows:
Pacific Northwest Research Institute
University of Colorado Health Science Center
Turku University Central Hospital
Medical College of Georgia
University of Washington and Lund
Diabetes Research Institute, Munich, Germany

Each of the 6 TEDDY clinic centers uses the TEDDY website to upload files to the DCC. There are screening forms, sample collection forms, enrollment forms, interview forms, family history forms, diet forms, physical examination forms and TEDDY book that have been developed for the study. Once a month each clinical center will send bulk shipments of serum and plasma samples to the NIDDK Repository and the data is transmitted to DCC electronically. Weight and length/height measurements will be taken at each clinic visit and the data transferred electronically to the DCC.

Basis for Award: Offerors shall submit a list of current and past contracts (with points of contacts) dating back three years in which the Offerors performed similar work as to the requirement being listed by FEMA identifying whether the Offeror was a Prime or Sub-Contractor. FEMA will utilize the provided information to determine if the Offeror or Offerors are technically qualified to accomplish the required task. The Offerors will be evaluated on: 

(1) Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' and critical team members demonstrated past performance in delivering quality products and services and in meeting technical, cost/price, and schedule requirements on similar programs; and to determine that the Offeror demonstrates the application of systemic improvement management practices and minimizing life cycle costs. The Past Performance risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant past performance. Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist. However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement. The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated. Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated. In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown. 

(2) Technical Qualification: The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' and critical team members' experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work. The Government will also evaluate the extent of relevant benefits (if any) that the Offeror gained from each contract/subcontract reference identified and how they relate to the task areas of the statement of work. The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience. Award will be made on Best Value Basis to Government.

<DESC>Please note that this solicitation is not ready to be issued; however, it is the intention of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to launch this solicitation on FedBizOps in the near future.
This solicitation requires the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts.  The services provided by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) program include, but will not be limited to the receipt of bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, production of bankruptcy notices, distribution of notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, using the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and to provide program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.
The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work under the contract. The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is accomplished by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees.  Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process.  Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients.  The volume of work will be dependent on the number of bankruptcy cases filed and the number of Bankruptcy Courts that use this program.  Presently, all 90 Bankruptcy Courts utilize the BNC with the exception of the Districts of the Virgin Island, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  At this time, it is estimated that the number of notices prepared and served by the Bankruptcy Courts in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007) will be approximately 105 million.   Historical volume information and program cost information will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted.    Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008.     
It is anticipated that this will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ), as well as a performance-based with an award fee incentive.  Anticipated performance is for one base period and nine-one year periods at the option of the Government. The contract does not have a set-aside requirement for small, service-disabled veterans, minority or woman-owned, or other businesses that can be classified under Government procurement set-aside definitions.
Again, this solicitation will be issued via the FEDBIZOPS - no paper copies will be mailed. Note: The response date in this FEDBIZOPS is not a firm date please see the RFP for the actual date once published.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting information from industry concerning the availability and development status of technology capable of providing a Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) capability for US Marine Corps (USMC) and US Navy (USN) rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine the maturity of the technology required to implement a HFI capability and to determine if the technology will meet the requirements to protect USMC and USN aircraft.  NAVAIR intends to use this data to aid in defining an acquisition strategy and assessing risks involved with implementing a HFI capability on USMC and USN aircraft.


2.  HFI Requirements:

The HFI capability should detect ballistic threats such as small arms, RPGs, and AAA directed at the aircraft. Once hostile fire is detected and declared, the HFI should provide the aircrew with a warning of the presence of hostile fire and provide a bearing to the HF.  Specific threats to be detected are identified in a classified specification.   If you desire to examine this classified specification, please contact Don Harwood (Assault DIRCM Engineer) at (301) 757-7909 to make the necessary arrangements.  The HFI technology may be integrated with the Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) for control and display or as integral part of the JATAS.  The HFI technology should have enough growth potential to include new threats as they emerge.  Aircraft targeted to have the HFI capability are the MV-22, CH-53K, AH-1Z, UH-1N, MH-60R and MH-60S, and potentially KC-130.  Proposed technology should be capable of being deployed on these USMC and USN aircraft beginning in 2014.

Written responses to the Request for Information shall be no greater than 30 pages in length.  If the RFI contains proprietary information, please mark it and identify disposition instructions (submitted material will not be returned).

<DESC>9/19/2007 Seeking Suppliers for Information on Standardization of   Nurse Call Systems This is a request for information for Nurse Call Systems.  The Department of Veteran Affairs, National Acquisition Center (NAC) is not seeking to procure a Nurse Call System at this time, but only to gather information on products that will enable our team to make an intelligent decision regarding the care of our veterans.  The VA, NAC, is conducting market research for various types of call systems that will empower the medical staff to make better healthcare decisions and facilitate patient safety, via a system that combines the latest in communication system hardware and software e.g., voice/visual intercoms, call switches, wireless intercoms/pendants and those models that have a remote alarm announcement.  Upgrading or replacement of existing VA systems is a beneficial consideration to any previously installed nurse call system.  Professional Clinicians, Nurses, and Technicians from various VA Hospitals will participate in the market research to help identify requirements for a system or systems, that will replace the many outdated platforms across VHA. There will be a Vendor Product Presentation, which will be held in Chicago in October 30-31, and Nov.1, 2007, at the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Acquisition Center, Building 37, 1 block North Cermak Road, Hines, Illinois.  Each vendor will be scheduled and given 1 &#189; for set-up, demonstrations/presentations, questions/answer segment and disassemble.  The clinical staff from the VA and Contract Officers/Specialists will be available during each scheduled presentation for questions and answers.  Once more, this will be an information only product presentation; therefore, company representatives who attend must be extremely knowledgeable, experienced, informative, and educated on the operations of their particular solution for a Nurse Call System.  The VA team will not only look at all sample call-systems but will inquire about the products' features and view product slides and demonstrations.  This market research will allow our team members to obtain an assessment of the products' features specifications.

<RESPDATE>100407
<ARCHDATE>12032007
<CONTACT>Billy Lemley, (256) 955-3441
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. (TBE) of Huntsville, AL for services relating to the development, acquisition, modification, maintenance, and operation of a computer-based simulation and modeling system.  These services and the associated technical/analytical support for Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) systems and their associated Battle Management, Command, Control, Communication, Com puters and Intelligence (BMC4I) systems have long been under development by TBE, the incumbent contractor, under contract DASG60-00-C-0054.  The proposed acquisition is directed to TBE pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only  One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   Since program inception TBE has been the only provider of services and is the only contractor capable of continuing to provide the required highly skilled contra ctor support services required to meet the needs of the USASMDC Future Warfare Center (FWC) and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The services required to meet the needs of the FWC and MDA include a broad range of technical and analytical activities. TBE has developed and delivered to the U.S. Government a unique, complex, and comprehensive BMC4I and weapon system simulation program referred to as EADSIM. The simulation has been developed to help assess IAMD BMC4I architectures and weapons systems in conce rt with the IAMD operational concepts. This includes the assessment of active defense, passive defense, attack operations, and BMC4I tiers.  To make needed modifications and enhancements to the EADSIM program on a no-risk, cost-effective basis, it is manda tory to possess in-depth knowledge of the 2.8 million lines of Code that make up EADSIM.  This simulation and modeling program is extremely flexible; because it models a large slice of a theater-level joint and combined IAMD BMC4I architecture and weapon  system mix, and has the potential for supporting a wide variety of BMC4I and weapon system simulation and modeling efforts.  Currently, the EADSIM program has over 350 users worldwide including all of the U.S. armed services and international partners and  allies.  Only TBE possesses the knowledge,  experience, and ability to apply the needed technical and operational expertise without massive information gathering and extensive training programs.  This acquisition will continue and build-up the prior work of TBE and it has been determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition.   This action is not open to foreign participation.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described suppli es or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  The proposed contract action is for services f or which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties who believe they can pe rform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, no more than 15 pages in length, to include detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analy sis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Governments requirements.  In order to be responsive, the statement must demonstrate:  (1) a history of proven experience in developing, operating and maintaining EADSIM support; and (2) the ability to immediately assume the on-going project without disruption to current operations.  Responses without the required documentation will be considered nonresponsive.  The above stated information must be received no later than 1 5 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite number W9113M-07-R-9999, and should be mailed to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.  Contracting Officer is Mr. Billy Lemley, SMDC-RDCM-SS, (256)  955-3441, or e-mail billy.lemley@smdc.army.mil.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be conside red solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a response that will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.

The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>70 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO THE KEVRIC COMPANY, INC.
<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board intends to award a sole source contract to Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS).

Electronic Data Systems (EDS) is uniquely qualified in providing continued support of the NLRB's Case Activity Tracking System (CATS), which is the Agency?s system of record for case information. The CATS application is a result of the NLRB?s initiative to meet automation needs for Unfair Labor Practice and Representation case processing. The CATS application is a custom developed Borland Delphi/SQL Server application written and developed by EDS. The EDS developed application is comprised of the following:

?	Over 224,367 lines of application code. The application was developed using Borland Delphi and is currently operating under Delphi 7.

?	The CATS Microsoft SQL Server application database is comprised of over 419 tables, 262 custom developed stored procedures and 824 database triggers.

In addition to the application Delphi code, portions of the CATS application were also developed and interfaced using the following third party development tools:

?	Business Objects (Crystal) Reports,
?	Microsoft Excel,
?	Microsoft Word, and
?	Acellio Capture (Form Flow).

EDS has the experienced personnel knowledgeable in the NLRB CATS system. The EDS team possesses NLRB business and case handling process knowledge.  This in-depth understanding of the business processes was required to implement the processes through application code, data entity relationships, database table structures, stored procedures and triggers.

This knowledge and experience is further required as the agency migrates to their Next Generation Case Management (NGCM) system. All case related legacy systems will be migrated or integrated into the NGCM system, and the existing knowledge of the legacy systems will be required to make this transition efficiently and timely. The first migration of the CATS is underway, with the first increment scheduled for completion on October 31, 2007. Due to funding issues, this NGCM increment completion date must be held, and in order to make this deadline an experienced development team in the CATS is required. Time is not available for a new team to gain the required knowledge and experience in the Agency?s business processes or CATS application code to assist in the current and future CATS integrations.

_____SCOPE OF WORK
The National Labor Relations Board requires contract support for maintaining the Agency?s Case Activity Tracking System (CATS) legacy application under the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  The OCIO is responsible for maintaining the CATS application, a Borland Delphi 7/Microsoft SQL Server custom developed application. The application has been designated as a mission-critical application as it is the system of record for all case related information. 

Maintenance of the CATS legacy application involves full software development life cycle support which includes gathering requirements for system change requests, coding, designing, testing, and deploying system changes, and updating system documentation. 

In addition to Delphi related application code, the application interfaces and requires support of third party related application features associated with the following party development tools:

?	Business Objects (Crystal) Reports ? CATS Report features
?	Microsoft Excel ? CATS Query Wizard and CATS Report features
?	Microsoft Word ? CATS Correspondence Merge and Template features
?	Acellio Capture (Form Flow) ? CATS Charge and Petition filing features

The CATS legacy application was initially developed using Borland Delphi 3 and is currently maintained using Borland Delphi 7. In addition to Borland Delphi experience, the application and SDLC support tasks require experience in Microsoft Office, XML, Microsoft SQL Server 2000, Serena PVCS, Computer Associates ErWin, and Microsoft Project.

The release of this RFI affords industry the opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments. The Government's purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative. The Government believes industry feedback is important. The Government is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative. What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI, are industry standards, and describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years. What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques? Describe your experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts.

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS. The Government is interested in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware and software maintenance support. The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.). Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics. Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.

Questions to the Government may be included under separate cover for all submissions.

<SUBJECT>--EFMP Respite Child Care Off-Post
<DESC>The U.S. Army, Fort Carson, Colorado intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Child Care Connections for Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Respite Child Care. The following is the determination of this decision: Description of Services: Fort Carson  Army Community Services (ACS) has a need to provide respite care for Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Dependents of active duty service members with exceptional needs ranging from low to moderate.  The purpose of this care is to provid e spouses of deployed soldiers a temporary rest period from primary care of persons with exceptional needs.  This rest period will allow the caregiver the opportunity to attend to other priority issues that have been delayed or postponed due to caregiver r esponsibilities. The anticipated quantity for this requirement is 3,000 hours of service, which equates to approximately 1 child per hour based upon 52 weeks and a 40 hour week. The harm that will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time: This requirement, if not approved, would create a severe hardship on family members of deployed soldiers which could result in escalating social problems at Fort Carson. This service is designed to assist spouses of deployed family members and directly imp acts the morale and welfare of deployed soldiers and their immediate families.  A bona-fide need has been established as the Fort Carson as ACS currently has 8 applications pending for this service including 3 families pending medical review. The Army has recognized the need to sustain the morale of deployed soldiers and provide family member assistance through ACS services.  The harm that will come to the Government if desired contractor does not receive the award: If Child Care Connection does not receive the award this requirement could not be fulfilled in its entirety.  Some family members would be required to seek assistance from El Paso County Social Services and may also be required to pay for services out-of- pocket.  The price of this service ranges from $5.00 to $25.00 per hour and would be a financial hardship on many soldiers families. Child Care Connection is a non-profit organization serving El Paso, Teller, Elbert and Kiowa Counties for over 18 years as  a child care resource and referral organization.  They provide child care referral for families to licensed providers.  In addition, they provide training for people who want to become licensed child care providers and provide ongoing training for child c are providers.  Actions to Increase Competition: The National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA) maintains a nationwide database of qualified exceptional needs care providers. NACCRRA determined their was only one qualified agency in El Paso County.  A search of the Centra l Contractor (CCR) database for NAICS Codes (624410 and 624110) did not reveal any sources. Market research has revealed this service is very specialized and there is extremely limited sources available.  The number of service providers diminish with the s everity of supported needs. Market Research Conducted: Market research has revealed there are two providers (Child Care Connections and Pikes Peak Family Connections) of service for low to moderate needs children outside Fort Carson. First, Child Care Connections is a not-for-profit organization.  This provide r subcontracts all services through care providers they have certified.  One recommendation is Zachs Place who has the capacity for 8 children; price ranges from $5.00 hr to $25.00 hr; age ranges from 5 yrs to 21 yrs; hours of operation is 7:15 a.m. to 6: 00 p.m., with occasional evenings and weekends; and all staff members are required to attend training and must be certified through the state.  Second, Pikes Peak Family Connections is a not-for-profit (no fee for service) organization.  Their service is p rimarily targeted to at risk children and they have a maximum age restriction of 5 years.  They are not capable of supporting children with moderate to severe needs.   This is a sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.320-1) and (FAR 13.501).  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any firm that believes it can meet the re quirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in SUFFICIENT detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements list ed above.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the G overnment will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Child Care Connections.  Responses are due 4:00 PM (MST) 24 September 2007.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Fort Carson, Colorado intends to negotiate a sole source contract with IMWRF Fort Carson (Child and Youth Services) for Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Respite Child Care. The following is the determination of this decision: Description of Services: Fort Carson Army Community Services (ACS) has a need to provide respite care for Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Dependents of active duty service members with exceptional needs ranging from low to moderate.  The purpose of this care is to provide  spouses of deployed soldiers a temporary rest period from primary care of persons with exceptional needs.  This rest period will allow the caregiver the opportunity to attend to other priority issues that have been delayed or postponed due to caregiver re sponsibilities.  The anticipated quantity for this requirement is 36,000 hours of service, which equates to approximately 17 children per hour based upon 52 weeks and a 40 hour week. The harm that will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time: This requirement, if not approved, would create a severe hardship on family members of deployed soldiers which could result in escalating social problems at Fort Carson.

A bona-fide need has been established as the ACS currently has 19 applications pending for this service including 7 families pending medical review.  The Army has recognized t he need to sustain the morale of deployed soldiers and provide family member assistance through ACS services.  There are very limited exceptional need caregivers in the El Paso County area, a survey of these service providers revealed there were none with the capacity to fulfill this requirement.  The harm that will come to the Government if desired contractor does not receive the award: If Fort Carson Child Youth services does not receive the award this requirement could not be fulfilled in its entirety.  Some family members would be required to seek assistance from El Paso County Social Services and may also be required to pay for servic es out-of-pocket.  The price of this service ranges from $5.00 to $25.00 per hour and would be a financial hardship on many soldiers families.  MWR Child Youth Services is located on Fort Carson property.  The location of this facility provides for ease o f access and convenience to most family members needs, but if required to seek care outside of this installation they would incur additional hardship and cost.  The MWR Child Youth Services charges a fixed price for this type of child care service ranging  from $2.00 to $3.50 per hour. Actions to Increase Competition: The National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA) maintains a nationwide database of qualified exceptional needs care providers.  NACCRRA determined there was only one qualified agency in El Paso County.

Their service is primarily targeted to at risk children and the maximum age restriction of 5 years.  They are not capable of supporting children with moderate to severe needs.  The second provider is Child Care Connections a not-for-pr ofit organization.  This provider subcontracts all services through care provi ders they have certified.  They do not have a single provider capable of supporting greater than 8000 hours per year.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A)
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION STATEMENT

PURCHASE -  SIPRNet and Ogden DMZ GIGAMONS, Ogden DMZ Lantronix ? CORAS 523685

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  

I. Requiring and - contracting activity:

Agency:
Defense Information Systems Agency ? Computing Services
5600 Columbia Pike  
Falls Church, VA 22041
(POC: Sandy Burns, 703-681-2521)

Contracting Activity:
Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)
Scott Field Office
2300 East Drive
Scott AFB, IL  62225-5406

II. Nature of Action The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Computing Services (CS) has a requirement to acquire a Network Packet Capture and Analysis solution to enable statistical analysis of the quantity and type of network traffic, the real or near-real time trouble-shooting of found or suspected problems or anomalies and the monitoring of overall performance levels in an effort to identify failures to meet Service Level Agreement objectives.  The scope of this initiative is to establish and implement an enterprise wide solution that will proactively monitor and troubleshoot network problems at the packet level.
The current and future infrastructure will require multiple points of visibility. Combined, the points to acquire data will consist of multiple data rates and multiple media types. Media conversion will be handled by the routers and switches supporting infrastructure data; however, the Network Packet Capture solution must be able to simultaneously capture data at 1Gbps on multiple data points. The media type supported for this data rate is copper Ethernet at 100Mpbs and 1Gbps.
Since multiple network points are identified for packet capturing, a versatile and cost effective solution is required to support one-to-one, aggregation, and replication relationships between inbound and outbound ports. This adaptability allows more flexibility when designating what infrastructure devices and Network Packet Capture tools connect to the unit. For example, two connections, one from a primary router and the other from a standby router, will need to be monitored simultaneously to determine why and when a failover occurs. Conditions also require that data coming from a network device will have to be simultaneously monitored by multiple tools. 
The equipment requested under this initiative is selected based on current and planned standardization and upgrades within the CSD architecture. 

III. Description of Acquisition / Supplies / Services:  One purpose of this acquisition is to install SIPRNet data-access switches to support classified data aggregation and replication for packet capturing and analysis at the following sites.  

SIPR Site 
SMC/PE Oklahoma
ISC/PE San Antonio
SMC/PE Montgomery
SMC/PE Mechanicsburg
ISC/PE Columbus
SMC/PE Ogden
PE Dayton
PE Chambersburg
PE St. Louis
PE Warner Robins
PE Denver

Another purpose of this acquisition is to install NIPRNet  data-access switches to support unclassified data aggregation and replication for packet capturing and analysis in the new Ogden DMZ.

Universal Imaging Utility (UIU)

IT managers have struggled with the limitations of imaging since the 1996 release of host, the first cloning application, from Binary Research Ltd. In the ten years that have followed, many IT professionals have grown so accustomed to these limitations that they can no longer imagine a complete cloning solution. That solution, however, has now arrived.

In 2004, Binary Research and Big Bang LLC introduced another first with the release of Big Bang?s Universal Imaging Utility (UIU). This ground-breaking innovation ensures that an Image created via any cloning application (Ghost, Acronis, Altiris, Novell ZENworks, etc.) will deploy to any business-class PC, both desktops and notebooks, regardless of make, model, processor, or configuration. The only qualification is that older client PCs (generally pre-1999 machines that don?t comply with the ACPI standard for power management) need one Image whereas newer ACPI-compliant PCs need a different Image. In the great majority of organizations, all PCs are ACPIcompliant and a single Universal Image is at long last a reality.

The UIU works by preparing a master PC (that is, a fully configured Windows 2000 or Windows XP platform that the user wishes to clone) immediately prior to executing any cloning software. Specifically, the UIU installs an extensive database of drivers on the PC to ensure that the Image, when created by the cloning software, will deploy successfully on virtually every PC. The key to this advance is the UIU?s driver database, which contains drivers for more than 35,000 hardware components from systems integrators and OEMs such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell, Sony, Panasonic, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and 3Com.

Despite the need to accommodate such a comprehensive suite of drivers, the database is small enough to fit comfortably on a single CD. Big Bang LLC has achieved this remarkable accomplishment by including so-called ?white box? drivers, which are functionally identical to their branded counterparts. Video card manufacturer ATI Technologies, for example, may produce branded drivers for each of its major customers: HP, IBM, Dell, and so on. These branded variants will typically differ in functionally insignificant ways such as inclusion of bespoke logos for each customer. The UIU database omits these brand variants, including instead only the unbranded versions that ATI Technologies and its counterparts supply ? typically, and hence the name, in white boxes ? to individuals who prefer to build their own PCs from OEM-supplied components.

Central Staging has been using Ghost for the past three years. Essentially, this is the next logical step in the development of our cloning solution. CSD Central Staging has successfully evaluated this product.

<DESC>This is a combined/synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, F2F3257215A001, is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05 and Defense DCN 20050913.  The solicitation listed here is 100% small business set aside.  The Federal Supply Class (FSC) K011.     The associated Standard Classification (SIC) is 3571.     The North American Industry Classification System is 811310 and the size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to solicit and award this purchase order for the following products:     1 EA-  CLIN 0001-OPTION #1- Upgrade Existing NABCO TCV (Total Containment Vessel) to utilize the new NABCO Self-Closing Door (SCS).  In addition the TCV will be upgraded to operate in both the vented mode and the gas tight mode.  Onboard vapor phase sample system included.  The ability to decontaminate on-board piping is provided.  Repainting and certification of TCV included.  CLIN 0002-  Robotic Logic Control-NABCO Model PLC-01.  CLIN 0003-  NABCO Model #2 Trailer, All Aluminum Construction.  CLIN 0004- Onan Generator Upgrade, Model 7000KW.  CLIN 0005-  Round Trip Freight. This is a sole brand name requirement, so only the above mentioned products will be accepted. The following is the brand name justification signed by the contracting officer:     
1.Requiring Authority: 1 SOCES/CED-  SSgt Jeremy Gibson
2. Description of Requirement: Purchase of Total Containment Vessel (TCV) Upgrade
3. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition: FAR 13.106-
1(b) (2). FAR 13.501 (a)(2)(i)
4. Justification or Authority for action:
1.  The NABCO Model 42 TCV will support homeland defense and force protection functions.  The TCV upgrade will eliminate top loading procedures and enable EOD to better utilize their robotic platforms.  In addition, the door will be operated by a switch allowing the use of robotics rather than EOD personnel approaching the TCV during loading and unloading of explosives.  The TCV upgrade kit, when installed on the current TCV, will allow more safe operations to be conducted by EOD personnel.
2.  NABCO?s line of TCV?s are proven reliable and are currently the standard for both military and civilian Bomb Squad units.  Our current platform is made by NABCO and their policy clearly states that the warranty on the current Model 42 TCV will be void if any other company, other than NABCO, attempts to perform the upgrades.  NABCO has no way of controlling the adherence of requirements by other companies. 
3.  The TCV upgrade kit provides gas-tight operation to allow for safe handling and mitigation of explosive devices associated with chemical and biological agents.  In addition vapor samples can be drawn from the interior of the vessel as well as the ability to decontaminate and treat remnants of a detonation.

Delivery will be made to 1 SOCES/SSgt Jeremy Gibson/16 CES/CED/272 Red Horse Road/Hurlburt Field, FL 32544-5816.  The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition.

 A.5 HSAR 3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006)
 
   (a) Prohibitions.
 
     Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
 
   (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
 
     Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
 
     Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
 
     Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)--
 
     (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
 
     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
 
        (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
 
        (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
 
     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
 
       Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
 
   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
 
     (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
 
        (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
 
        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
 
     (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4- year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
 
     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
 
   (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
 
   (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 
     (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests.
 
     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
 
   (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:
 
 [x]it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73; []it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74, which has not been denied; or []it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This is a solicitation of Purchase Request F4BS207239A001 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-20.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with a small business size standard of $23.0 million dollars. This acquisition is set aside for small businesses.

All responsible Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

The U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado operates two physically separate networks; USAFA.AF.MIL (3500 users)
and USAFA.EDU (6500 users).  They both include separate firewalls and
operate under different network security policies.  Vendors should assume
there is no connectivity allowed between the two networks that would not be
allowed from one network to an external network.  Both networks have
separate Microsoft active directory domains with no trust relationship
between them.

We need a Mass Notification System (MNS) that allows the USAFA command post
(and potentially other base organizations) to enter in an alert message and
have it "pop up" and display on computer workstation screen on each network.
The MNS needs to be integrated with active directory so that alert messages
can be targeted to just specific users in certain areas.

We expect vendor will provide two licenses (one for each network) to be
loaded on USAFA provided server hardware.  Actual user interface (command
post personnel) will be through a web interface where they will enter in the
alert message and target specific notification audience.  They would then
send the alert message.  Message will make use of Microsoft Windows XP SP2
and Vista desktop notification APIs to display the alerts.

Vendor should include 3 years of support and provide on-site installation of
their software on both networks and perform the configuration with active
directory.  Vendor will also provide training to 10th Communications
Squadron personnel on system administration duties as well as command post
personnel on proper use of the system to send out alert messages.

At some future date, USAFA may integrate the MNS with Dialogic
Communications Corporation's Communicator!NXT software which will allow
command post personnel to send out notifications via other means (telephone
calls, Giant voice, etc).  Vendor must certify their software is supported by NXT Communicator.


Delivery shall be completed not later than 4 weeks after receipt of an order and shall be FOB Destination.

The Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA (DDC) has a requirement for 15 DPM Imagers in accordance with the following salient characteristics.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS

Background:  The intent of this action is to procure a quantity of fifteen (15) Direct Parts Marking (DPM) imagers that can read and process Unique ID (UID) serial numbers to Unique Item Identifier (UII) as defined by MIL-STD-130M embedded in two (2) dimensional data matrix barcodes of requisite size as defined in MIL-STD-130M.  The barcodes are expected to print on label stock and adhere to the item; engraved, dot peen, electrochemical etching, laser, rubber stamped, decalcomania or photo anodized in the item itself or on a data plate attached to it.  The imager must connect to a PC via USB port and appear to the PC to be a keyboard wedge-like device.  The PC will be operating a TN3270E emulator such as Rumba or a web page to maintain a session with a CICS session on a IBM type mainframe operating OS390 or better mainframe.  For the purposes of this procurement, the DPM imager must have a ?batch? mode, where the imager can be disconnected from the PC, scan and process a data matrix barcode and pass the distilled data to the PC program when the DPM Imager is reattached.  Currently RF devices (such as the Bluetooth protocol) devices are not being considered.

Note:  MIL-STD-130M can be found at the following web site and is approved for public release.  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID/attachments/mil-std-130m-20051202.pdf

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  It is the responsibility of interested sources to monitor FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded to acquire commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware.

Instrument shall be battery powered for field-use in locations such as ports, warehouses, and incident-scenes. The excitation source shall employ an x-ray tube and shall not employ a radioactive isotope source.  X-Ray power shall, at a minimum, be sufficient to be able to excite the 37.1 KeV emission peak from Neodymium to allow for detection of neodymium below electroplated coatings of transition metals.  Hand held unit weight shall not exceed 3 lbs.  Unit shall include rechargeable batteries (a minimum of 2 sets of batteries per unit, each capable of a minimum of 4 hours of operation, as well as at least one charger for batteries).  Each unit shall also include an AC adapter.   The analyzer's display shall include a touch screen display which allows data-input and reading of results at the point of use.  A portable testing stand with an enclosure with effective x-ray shielding shall be provided for each unit, which collapses easily without tools to allow hand-carrying into the field.  This stand shall allow tool-free setup, attachment and removal of the analyzer.  A backscatter shield for the analyzer shall be provided for each unit to reduce exposure to backscattered x-rays when using in handheld operation.
Each analyzer shall include preprogrammed modes of operation for the determination of lead and other RoHS elements in metals and in plastics and a mode for user-definable calibrations and analyses.  Calibration standards shall include a minimum of 1 alloy standard and 1 plastic standard reference material for calibration check.  Each unit shall include user-friendly, graphical interfaced software compatible with Microsoft Windows.  Each must include modes for quantitative determination of concentrations in percent and parts per million of target elements in plastic and in metals.  For data handling, each unit must include a means for assigning sample numbers to test data and storing, transferring and retrieving reports and sample numbers securely, including transfer of data to Windows PC.  Units shall record and save data for each measurement in a secure manner.  A carrying case and belt-holster must be provided for each unit. A user's manual must be provided. 

This solicitation will result in a fixed price (per unit) IDIQ contract.  Guaranteed minimum is 3 each for the base period.  Possible option quantities not to exceed 20 each depending on agency need.  A single award will be made.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate increased and to negotiate technically upgraded models of analyzers purchased by mutual agreement between the Government and the contractor should the need for additional units arise or technical enhancements be developed by the manufacturer that are required by the Government.  Units must be delivered no later than four weeks after receipt of an order by the vendor.  

Only written quotes will be accepted.  In response to this notice, quoters must submit pricing:  Analyzer:  CLIN 0001 9/24/07 - 9/23/08, CLIN 0001a price per unit, CLIN 0001b onsite training, CLIN 0002 9/24/08 - 9/23/09, CLIN 0002a price per unit, CLIN 0002b onsite training, CLIN 0003 9/24/09 - 9/23/10, CLIN 0003a price per unit, CLIN 0003b onsite training, CLIN 0004 9/24/10 - 9/23/11, CLIN 0004a price per unit, CLIN 0004b onsite training,  CLIN 0005 9/24/11 - 9/23/12, CLIN 0005a price per unit, CLIN 0005b onsite training.  Proposed price per unit must include the handheld x-ray fluorescence analyzer unit and all components identified above, with all software fully loaded and ready to use and with all necessary software and cables for connectivity to multiple personal computers for data transfer, and all shipping and hazmat costs, all shipping and handling costs for all components.  The price for on-site user training is for training to be held at the following location: 10901 Darnestown Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.  Length of delivery time after receipt of order by the vendor must be specified (and must not exceed 4 weeks).   Quotes shall include warranty information.  Quotes must be FOB Destination.  Quotes must be valid for a minimum of 30 calendar days after the date and time for submission of quotes specified below.  

Quoters must also submit the manufacturer name and model number of units proposed.  Any vendor quoting an alternative product must provide complete supporting documentation the that product is equal to the brand name identified and that it meets all minimum essential characteristics cited above, in particular adequate KeV to excite 37.1 KeV emission peak from Neodymium.  This requirement is mandatory because rare-earth magnets must be detected, which are typically made from neodymium with an electroplated coating of durable, attractive metals, such as copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.    While it is possible to excite a lower energy emission line for neodymium with a lower power tube, the fact that these magnets are typically coated with metals such as copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, and others for durability and appearance may shield such emissions from being detected.  Failure to provide supporting technical  documentation will make the quoter ineligible for award.  Quoters must identify the location of equipment manufacture. 

Quoters must submit a completed copy of 52.212-3 - Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, or provide their DUNS number for online accessible Representations and Certifications in ORCA.

Quoters must submit past performance information for a minimum of three other Federal, state or local agencies or commercial entities for which they have provided the same or similar units and support, including the name and phone number of a point of contact for reference. 

The following clauses are incorporated by reference: 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal; 52.212-3 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items; 52.212-3 - Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; 52.212-5 - Contract terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items and the following clauses apply:   52.219-8, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-50, 52.225-1, 52.225-5, 52.225-13,  52.232-29, 52.232-33, 52.239-1;  52.217-5 - Evaluation of Options;  52.217-6  Option for Increased Quantity [fill in: the term of the contract]; FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the term of the Contract [fill ins: the term of the contract; 30 days prior to contract expiration; five years]; 52.247-34 - FOB: Destination.

3 new) will be realigned between the new total of 2 SU?s (1 existing and 1 new). This will 
allow the SU?s to share the load and adds redundancy to this building.
A speaker will also be added to the office in building 441, in the office area; which will allow 
for 2 way voice communications with the RCC.

Building 585- With the addition of network cameras to the existing CCTV system, it is necessary to add an additional Access Point (AP). The AP will be added at the same location as the existing systems radios.
With the addition of the second AP, all the cameras system wide will need to be realigned.The contractor will need to change what Access Point controls which camera at most of the locations throughout the CCTV system. 
With this re-alignment if one AP fails, half of the system will stay operating until repairs to the down AP are made. Speakers and a microphone will be added to the system monitoring PC at the RCC to allow for 2 way voice communications with other networked buildings.

Made of 75D polyster with a polymer, thermo-polyurethane coating includes stuff sack.  Import.  72" x 20", Wt: 1.53 lb. Thickness: 1" Roll size: 5.12" x 10.63"   Yes, Ranger Joes A1984-01

2. Will you accept partial bids, or is this an all or nothing?   Partial bids will not be accepted.

3. These items are listed in varying quantities: LBT 6124KIT-S/M and LBT 6124AUC. I?m assuming that what the customer wants is:
LBT 6124KIT-AUC-S/M (60)andL BT 6124KIT-AUC-L/XL (20). This is correct.

4. The specs you have listed say these include soft protection.  They do not include Kevlar panels which is the soft armor or protection you are talking about. They are only covers, that cover these areas. Please clarify with the customer on this.     I'm assuming they want covers for the vest, groin and throat, in sizes for small/medium and large/xlarge. The AUC designates Army Universal Camo. The part number 6124AUC-SIZE is only a vest cover. Vendor is correct--this is only a cover.

   (a) Prohibitions.
 
     Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
 
   (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
 
     Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
 
     Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

        (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
 
     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
 
       Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
 
   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
 
     (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
 
        (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
 
        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
 
     (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4- year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
 
     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
 
   (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<CONTACT>Sheila Rushlow Contract Specialist 3016638206103  sheila_rushlow@nps.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to provide clarification, response to questions, change the specifications and extend the response date for bids to September 24, 2007, 12:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time. Bidders must be registered in Contractor Central Registration (www.ccr.gov) at the time of submission.  On your bid please confirm registration and provide your Dunn and Bradstreet Number.   Provide a revised schedule to allow for Sugar Creek's lead time of five weeks to order the half round windows.  A revised schedule shall include necessary lead times and installation.  All work shall be done  not-later-than schedule of November 22, 2007.     CLARIFICATION  Quantities identified in SECTION C, DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS, PART 2 - PROJECT NARRATIVE, are correct.  As noted below, some of the information included in the Window and Transom survey is identified as work not included in the contract.   RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 1.  Your written proposal refers to a Quantity of 8 Fixed, single-sash transom storm windows and referencing this as part of the 1st and Second Floor, yet according to the attached survey, there are no transom windows on the 1st or 2nd floor schedule.  The eight fixed single-sash transom storm windows are listed on the Transom and Sidelight Survey. 2.  On the transom and sidelight survey, we are thoroughly confused.  As best we can tell, there are 15 transom/sidelights listed but this number does not correspond to any quantity listed in the RFP. Shaded line items 2, 6, 7, 11 and 13 are NOT included.  Line items 1, 3 through 5, 8 through 10 and 12 for a total of 8 transoms are included in the contract.   3.  Similarly, as best we can tell line item Number 2 on the transom survey lists single panel transom, a pair of sidelites and a pair of transoms. As noted above, line item Number 2 is not included in the contract.   4.  Dimensions are listed as 21.5 x 32, but then in the comments (2) 21.5 x 11 and (2) 84 x 11 are noted.  What do these comments mean? To which transoms do they refer? Are we correct that the quantity of the sidelight and sidelight transoms are two for each opening identified as Item 2 and Item 7? Dimensions listed are for the single panel transom.  The comments refer to a pair of sidelight transoms.  The 84 x 11 is a pair of sidelight transoms as well.  Two sidelights, two sidelight transoms and one door transom for each door listed on Line Item Number 2 and Number 7.   Also, what kind of frame modifications are necessary on doors 102 and 202? In accordance with Section C, Descriptions/Specifications, Part 2 - Project Narrative, Paragraph 2.6 Storm Window Installation,  Paragraph B, Preparation, "The Government will be responsible for removing all portions of the and completing any necessary painting as required to permit the proper installation of new materials." 5.  What is the distinction between a single-panel transom and sidelight transoms?  Are they not both 	simply fixed storm units akin to a picture window?  A single-panel transom refers to a transom over a door.  A sidelight transom refers to a transom over a sidelight.  They are both fixed storm units akin to a window.     6.  Also, lead time from the factory on custom-painted storms is a minimum of 8-12 weeks; lead time on half-round custom storms is 5 weeks minimum.  Deadlines will need to be extended considerably and subject to the general uncertainties of factory production. The Government is not requiring a custom color; however we do want a standard Sugar Creek color that is closest to the existing paint color.  See change below.  If the lead time on the half-round custom storms is 5 weeks minimum, that time with the added time for installation needs to be identified in a revised schedule submitted with your response.   7.  IIn Section C - Descriptions/Specifications document, para 2.1.A  Group #2 states "Quantity Transom/sidelight storm window set  consisting of 3...". I need to know which line item(s) in the available spreadsheets labeled "Gambrill House Exterior Transom & Sidelight Survey" or "Ganbrill House Exterior Storm Window Survey"  that Section C is specifically referring to. I believe the answer I am  looking for is something like - Section C, Qty 1 for Group #2 is  referring to HPTC Door Number or Window number ____. The transom/sidelight storm window set was inserted between Line Item Numbers 42 and 43 on the Exterior Storm Window Survey.  They are part of Door assembly D202 listed under Line Item Number 7 on the Transom and Sidelight Survey which should be cross referenced for related sizes.   8.  Section C para 2.1.B. "Group #4" should this be changed to "Group Number 1"? Yes, this should be changed to Group Number 1.  See change below.   CHANGES TO SPECIFICATIONS Section C, Description/Specifications, is modified as follows: 1.  Page C-2, Paragraph B, Line 5, Group Number 4 is changed to Group Number 1.   2.  Pages C-2 and C-3, Paragraph 2.2, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS, Paragraph B, Test Reports and Paragraph G, Samples are deleted in their entirety.     3.  Page C-5, Paragraph 2.5, FINISH AND COLOR, line 5 is modified to delete "It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure adequate pricing is provided for a custom color if it requires additional cost to product the closest color match available. " and replace it with the following:  "The Contractor shall provide a standard Sugar Creek color that is closest to the existing paint color."

Sole-Source Justification for use of Brand Name


This new camera package will be integrated into our current editing system, the AVID Media Composer as our main source of video footage. The new XDCAM footage will be used with older DVCAM footage. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase the SONY XDCAM HD to fill this requirement. The SONY XDCAM HD is directly supported by the AVID Media Composer. The SONY XDCAM HD footage can be directly captured into the AVID Media Composer without shuttling through footage. The SONY XDCAM HD footage is brought into the AVID as MXF files and as part of the end to end file based workflow of the SONY XDCAM HD and AVID Media Composer; it is possible to send clips and sequences over Fire Wire to XDCAM disks, as MX files,, DVCAM or XDCAM. This very technical requirement allows for use of our older SONY DVCAM footage and newer SONY XDCAM HD footage to be used seamlessly in the AVID Media Composer, this workflow is unique to the SONY XDCAM HD Camera.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The NAICS Code is 334611 with a size standard of 500 employees. The Department of Health and Human Services seeks to acquire a WebInspect perpetual user license and user license annual maintenance utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.100, 12.603, and 12.602.  

The software will be used by Information Technology Auditors to perform vulnerability assessments of computer web applications and services during the normal review of operations at auditees.  The software, WebInspect by SPI Dynamics, can analyze the numerous Web applications and Web services in an auditee?s environment quickly and easily and is maintained and updated daily which is critical due to the ever changing environment of the web.

SPI Dynamics vulnerability database is one of the most comprehensive and accurate knowledgebases on the market.  WebInspect checks for all of the following vulnerabilities:

Command Execution, HTTP Compliance, SQL Injection, WebDAV Compliance, Cross-Site Scripting, SSL Strength, Directory Traversal, Certificate Analysis, Abnormal Input, Content Investigation, Parameter Overflow, Spam Gateway Detection, Buffer Overflow, Client-Side Pricing, Parameter Addition, Sensitive Developer Comments, Path Manipulation, WebServer/Web Package, Path Truncation, Identification, Character Encoding, Absolute Path Detection, MS-DOS 8.3 Short Filename, Error Message Identification, Character Stripping, Permissions Assessment, Site Search, Brute Force Authentication, Application Mapping, Known Attacks, State Management, Crawl, Directory Enumeration, Automatic Form-Filling, Web Server Assessment, SSL Support, Parameter Injection, Proxy Supp.

If the OIG attempted to conduct an audit without such a product, they would be unable to properly determine if proper controls were in place during an assessment.  The OIG has staff members who are familiar with the product as it is currently utilized for vulnerability assessments of their internal websites and services.  By standardiziing on an existing product, the OIG can share technical expertise, troubleshooting, and operational use by all staff.  This will also reduct the need for additional training from the vendor.  If OIG purchased a non-standard vulnerability web assessment tool, OIG could come under scrutinization by outside peer reviews for not following internal policy of standardization that has been dictated by the current HHS Secretary.  SPI Dynamics, Inc. is the exclusive manufacturer and provider.

Any and all interested offerors are encouraged to submit a quote.  Please request a copy of the RFQ from Clint Druk at clint.druk@psc.gov if you wish to be considered for this requirement.

All questions must be submitted in writing via email to Clint Druk at clint.druk@psc.gov by 2:00 PM EASTERN TIME Tuesday, September 19, 2007. All quotes must be submitted via electronic copy and to the addresses and locations cited in attached solicitation by section by 10:00 AM EASTERN TIME, Thursday, September 20, 2007.  Quotes shall be in .pdf or Microsoft Word format.

Statement of Work for Commercial Lease of Administrative Vehicles
U. S. Department of State
(A/OPR/GSM/FMO)

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Continuous long term (e.g., twelve consecutive months or longer) lease of administrative vehicles.

VEHICLE SUMMARY
The general types of vehicles required shall be as follows:
	Automobiles/Sedans: sub-compact, compact, mid-size, large executive, premium executive
	Passenger Vans: seven to fifteen passenger, front-wheel or all-wheel drive when available
	Cargo Vans: compact and full-size
	Pick Up Trucks: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, standard and extended cab, 4x2 and 4x4
	Sport Utility Vehicles: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, 4x2 and 4x4

The DOS will specify vehicle type and desired options on each call; Lessor may provide any manufacturer model vehicle that meets both DOS requirements and Buy American Act regulations.  Vehicles may be any color (black, dark blue, or white preferred), with the exception that large executive and premium executive sedans must be black or dark blue.  

Vehicles will be provided with flexible fuel gas/ethanol (E85) capability when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered.  Hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles operating on alternative fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or propane, are acceptable when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered, but must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). It is the DOS's intent to burn biodiesel fuel in any diesel-powered vehicle provided by the Lessor, unless specifically prohibited by the vehicle manufacturer; it is the Lessor's responsibility to notify the COR of any such prohibitions prior to accepting the call for the vehicle.  The Lessor will not provide 4x4 vehicles unless specifically ordered or approved in advance by the COR.

LEASE TERMS
Basic Agreement Period: The BPA shall be valid for one base year with two one-year options. 

General: In response to this request for proposal (RFP), the Lessor will provide a price schedule for all vehicle types the Lessor will make available under this BPA; the Lessor's price proposal will become a formal part of the BPA upon award. While the Lessor is not required to provide a price schedule for every vehicle type listed above, the Lessor must include a price proposal for large executive and premium executive four-door sedans as a minimum. 

The DOS will initially lease individual vehicles for twelve (12) consecutive months; each individual lease may be extended in one-month or multiple-month intervals thereafter, not to exceed 36 months in total.  Prior to expiration of any given lease period as specified in the call, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal modification to extend the lease if needed; the modification will specify the number of additional months and the corresponding price per month as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. 

There is no guaranteed minimum quantity that the DOS will order.

Ordering: As requirements arise, the COR will notify the Lessor of desired vehicle types, quantities, specifications and lease duration by fax or email, based on vehicle types offered in the Lessor's proposal. Within two business days of receipt of a request from the COR, the Lessor will notify the COR (by return fax or email) of vehicle availability and delivery lead-time for each vehicle requested.  The Lessor may offer and the COR may accept substitution of specific vehicle types/options other than those initially requested by the COR when agreed to by the COR in advance and at no additional cost to the government.  Upon determination by the COR that the Lessor's response is satisfactory to meet requirements, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal call against the BPA for the agreed upon vehicle(s) at the price specified in the Lessor's price schedule. The Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR within 15 days of issuance of the call by the CO, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR, in which case a not later than delivery date will be specified in the call. The Lessor will not provide vehicles to the COR until directed to do so by the CO via formal BPA call.

Extensions: Individual vehicle leases may be extended on a month-to-month or multiple-month basis by modification to the initial call prior to expiration of the call.  Existing calls may be extended and new calls may be issued up until the last day of the BPA base year or option year.  In those cases where the end of the period of performance specified in a call falls after the end of the BPA base/option year, the vehicle lease will terminate at the end of the period of performance specified in the individual call.  

Pricing:  For each vehicle type offered, the Lessor will provide a price schedule that includes standard per-month rates for months 1-12, months 13-24 and months 25-36. The DOS will issue calls for vehicle leases for any period of time ranging from twelve to 36 months, and will reimburse the Lessor the applicable rate for each month of the lease as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. (As a practical example, if the DOS issues a call for a vehicle lease for a 16 month period, the first twelve months will be invoiced/reimbursed at the monthly rate specified for months 1-12, and the next four months will be reimbursed at the rates specified for months 13-24.  Likewise, a 26 month lease will be invoiced/reimbursed at the rate specified for months 1-12 during the first twelve months, at the rates specified for months 13-24 for the next twelve months, and at the rates specified for months 25-36 for the last two months.) This rate structure will apply for all vehicles continuously leased by the DOS with no contractual break in service. For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles replaced during the specified lease period at the Lessor's discretion, because of maintenance problems, or due to age and mileage stipulations contained in other parts of this agreement, will be considered to be continuous, uninterrupted leases. 
Prices specified in the schedule will include no-charge mileage allowances available to the Lessor's best customers. Charges for cumulative mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits, if any, will be clearly defined in the Lessor's proposal. Finally, discounts for prompt payment will be defined in the Lessor's proposal.

Vehicle Replacements: The DOS may, at its option, require replacement of any vehicle that reaches three years of age or 45,000 miles during the agreed upon lease period, with the exception that the DOS may require replacement of large executive and premium executive sedans that reach two years of age or 30,000 miles. If this occurs, the Lessor will provide the replacement vehicle to the DOS for the remainder of the period specified in the call at no additional charge, and the replacement vehicle will be considered a continuous, uninterrupted lease as defined above. The Lessor may not replace any vehicle during the first 12-months of any lease period unless agreed upon in advance by the COR.

Termination:  
	General: Any vehicle(s) leased prior to the BPA expiration date will be retained by the DOS for the entire period of performance specified in the call regardless of the expiration date of the BPA; all terms and conditions of the BPA will remain in full force until the end of the lease period specified in each individual call.

	Grace Period:  At the end of each lease period, the Lessor will grant DOS a five workday grace period for DOS to ready the vehicle for return to the Lessor.  The Lessor will not charge DOS any lease fees during the grace period. Should the DOS fail to return the vehicle by the end of the grace period, the Lessor will be entitled to pro-rata payment for each day past the five-workday grace period (see Payments below). For the purposes of this requirement, a workday is defined as Monday through Friday, not including days the federal government is closed for business. 

	Delivery & Pick Up: The Lessor will deliver vehicles at the beginning of each lease period and retrieve vehicles at the end of each lease period at a location that is no more than 10 miles from the Main State building, located at 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520, unless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Lessor and the COR. The cost of such delivery and retrieval shall be included in the Lessor's final price proposal.  The Lessor's responsibility for delivery shall be met when the Lessor notifies the COR that the vehicle is ready for pick up by the DOS at the agreed upon location. The DOS's responsibility for return of vehicles shall be met when the COR notifies the Lessor that the vehicle is available for pick up by the Lessor at the agreed upon location.

INVOICES AND PAYMENTS
Invoices: The Lessor will send invoices to the COR by the 10th day of each calendar month for each vehicle leased the previous calendar month.    The Lessor will bill monthly for all leases, regardless of the length of the lease specified in the call. Invoices shall clearly specify the vehicle ID number and all associate charges for the month. The Lessor will specify all credits and any applicable discounts offered to the DOS for prompt payment on each invoice.

Payments: DOS will verify and submit invoices for payment upon receipt from the Lessor. If it becomes necessary for any reason to determine a daily or monthly rate for pro-rata invoice adjustments, a daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly rate specified in the call by 30 days. 

Charges for excess mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits and discount credits for prompt payment, if any, will be clearly identified on each invoice.  Excess mileage charges will be authorized for payment when such charges are in accordance with the Lessor's proposal and determined to be customary and reasonable by the COR. 


MAINTENANCE & REPAIRS 
The Lessor shall provide routine preventive maintenance (lubrication, oil/filter changes, replacement wipers and bulbs, etc.), breakdown maintenance/repairs, safety/emissions tests/inspections, and road-side assistance at no additional cost to DOS.  The Lessor will notify DOS when each vehicle is due for preventive maintenance, inspection or repair, and where the vehicle should be taken to obtain the required service.  DOS will deliver the vehicle to the designated maintenance facility as soon as possible for essential repairs (e.g., items due to manufacturer safety recall or that may cause damage to the equipment or a safety hazard for the operator or occupants) and within 10 work days of notice for non-essential service, and will retrieve the vehicle from that location upon notice from the vendor or Lessor that maintenance has been completed. The DOS will not have any repairs made to any vehicle without prior approval of the Lessor.

The Lessor will pay all fees and charges associated with vehicle towing, maintenance, repairs and inspections directly to the vendor performing the service. Lessor-designated maintenance facilities shall be within 10 miles of the Main State building, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Lessor and the COR. DOS will pay all normal operating expenses, including gasoline, oil, and tolls and parking fees.

The Lessor will provide a temporary replacement loaner vehicle, similar to the original vehicle, for any vehicle that will be out of service for maintenance or repairs for more than three consecutive business days; such loaner vehicles will be provided for the entire time period the original vehicle is out of service after the third day, and at no additional charge to the DOS.  The Lessor will provide a permanent replacement vehicle for any vehicle that will be out of service for more than ten consecutive workdays or that is out of service for breakdown repairs on more than three occasions during any twelve month period. Such permanent replacement vehicles will be provided for the remainder of the original vehicle lease period, and at no additional charge to the DOS; in these instances, the replacement vehicle shall meet the same specifications as the vehicle being replaced, unless differences in specifications are agreed upon in advance by the COR, and will be considered a continuation of the original lease for pricing purposes.

LICENSING FEES AND TAXES
Lessor shall pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees, charges and taxes.

LICENSE PLATES
All vehicles provided by the Lessor will be properly licensed, at the Lessor's expense, in accordance with procedures specified by the state in which the vehicle is registered.  The DOS reserves the right to replace Lessor vehicle license plates with official federal government vehicle license plates.  The DOS will ensure the security of license plates removed from Lessor vehicles and will replace the Lessor plates on the vehicle prior to return to the Lessor at the end of the lease period. 

INSURANCE
As a self-insured entity, the DOS shall be responsible for all repairs, or reimbursement for same to the Lessor, for any non-normal wear and tear or other damage sustained by the vehicle while in possession of the DOS. In the event DOS chooses to reimburse the Lessor for the cost of repairs  greater than $500, the DOS will reimburse the Lessor in an amount equal to the lesser of two commercial repair estimates, or the average of three commercial repair estimates obtained by the Lessor and provided to the COR. For repairs of $500 or less, the DOS will repair the vehicle or reimburse the Lessor based on one commercial repair estimate provided by the Lessor.  Repair or reimbursement will be at the COR's discretion.

For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles will be considered to be in the possession of the DOS from the time the DOS takes physical possession of the vehicle at the designated drop off point at the beginning of the lease period until the time the DOS delivers the vehicle to the designated drop off point at the end of the lease period, not including the time the vehicle is at a Lessor-designated maintenance/repair facility, during which time any damages to the vehicle will be addressed between the Lessor and the Lessor-designated repair facility. Drop off locations are addressed above, in the sub-paragraph entitled Delivery & Pick Up.


VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS
Lessors will respond to DOS's request for vehicles with a description of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, year of manufacture, body style, color, odometer reading, etc.) it proposes to provide to meet the DOS's requirement.  As a minimum, all vehicles will be provided with features, equipment, safety features and accessories defined by the vehicle's manufacturer as standard.  If the Lessor chooses to provide vehicles with additional features or comfort and convenience items not specifically requested by the DOS (such as high performance engines, heavy duty alternators,  heated seats, dual zone air conditioning, remote keyless entry, alarm system, etc.), such features will be provided at no additional cost to the DOS.  If the DOS requires features beyond those defined as standard, the COR will obtain availability, delivery lead-time and itemized price surcharge information for each additional feature from the Lessor prior to submitting a formal call for the vehicle; in the event the DOS eventually orders the vehicle, the call will specify the desired additional features and the authorized surcharge amount that the Lessor may add to the basic monthly rate specified for that vehicle in the price schedule.

The Lessor will furnish to the DOS two (2) sets of vehicle keys, including remote keyless entry fobs if the vehicle is so equipped, which will be returned to the Lessor at lease termination.  The DOS will be responsible for the replacement of lost or damaged keys and remote entry fobs.
