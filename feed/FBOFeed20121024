<DESC>The U.S. EPAs NVFEL intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with AVL Test Systems, Inc. for rebuild and repair of four (4) Flame Ionization Detector (FID) analyzers, and two (2) Nox analyzers, along with their vacuum pumps.  The 4 FID analyzers require portions of the burn chamber to be replaced and cleaned. The 2 Nox analyzers need cleaning and seal replacements. All of these parts are part of an AVL Gem 110 master bench. The bench itself also utilizes vacuum pumps with continuous draw for Nox sampling. The vacuum pumps need to be rebuilt annually to maintain the correct flow for sampling.
AVL is uniquely qualified to do this work due to the proprietary nature of both the testing equipment and the software that comprise the AVL Gem 110 master bench. AVL is the only source for parts and software that are compatible with the master bench.  In the past, market research has not yielded any interest from other sources. 
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the NVFELs requirement may submit technical documentation to attempt to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documents must be submitted within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice will be considered solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. Written requests should be submitted via email to Noah Goldberg at Goldberg.noah@epa.gov. No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<a href="mailto:anjennette.c.rodriguez@nasa.gov">AnJennette C. Rodriguez</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA12AA24C with ASRC Research & Technology Solutions (ARTS) pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.	The period of performance will be extended for a potential eighteen-month period. The extension will begin January 1, 2013 and end June 30, 2014 to (1) allow sufficient time to finalize contract award activities associated with the new procurement, Project and Engineering Support Services (PESS), and (2) provide continuity of critical engineering support in the small spacecraft development area, including the following projects that are scheduled to launch in late 2013:  Lunar Atomosphere Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Comprehensive Hierarchial Aeromechanics Model (CHARM), Edison Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks (EDSN), Nanosatellite Launch Adapter System (NLAS), SporeSat, and EcAMSat. The extension includes time for any slips in the scheduled launches.  For more information on PESS, please visit the Internet site for the NASA/ARC Business Opportunities page at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21  The extension is determined to be the best interest of the Government to ensure uninterrupted engineering support to NASA/ARC until a new contract is awarded. The current contractor, ARTS, is considered the only capable contractor that can meet NASA/ARCs needs given the short period performance for this extension.  Additionally, competing the requirement for a period of up to eighteen months would not be possible given the end date of the current contract and the strict requirement of uninterrupted support.  Awarding the potential eighteen-month contract extension to another contractor at the same time the new requirement is in process would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through completion of the extension as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA/ARCs critical requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to AnJennette C. Rodriguez, via email at AnJennette.C.Rodriguez@nasa.gov, not later than 1:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST) on November 3, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 11/09/12. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are: Sensata Technologies (55YR1) and US Army Armament (59678). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 11/09/12. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved source is Goodrich Corporation (3CPE0). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.<br /><br /></span></p>
<span>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been using the Mathwork's product line for over 12 years. Mathwork's MATLAB product, and tools, has been the software suite that suit to the needs for NIST's researchers.  NIST researchers in both Gaithersburg and Boulder use Mathworks products to enable them to perform high-level technical computing language and use an interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation that serve the missions of their laboratory and the agency.<br />The current Mathworks licensed products are critical to the success of NIST researchers for their work.  Although there may be different product and maintenance service available, the institutional knowledge that has been built using the Mathworks products all these years will be extremely difficult to replace.  The continued renewal of the maintenance contract with the Mathworks Software Maintenance Service (SMS) ensures uninterrupted and reliable support service from Mathworks. The twice-yearly general product releases via the Mathworks SMS are essential to ensure the latest software is available to the NIST's user community.<br />In addition, there are multiple current projects dependent on the past and current MATLAB runs and configurations.  Terminating the use of the Mathworks MATLAB and tools licenses will significantly interrupt the flow of the output of these ongoing projects and will severely hamper NIST research efforts.  Furthermore, NIST researchers who have run public domain Mathworks look-alike products find those products do not satisfy their needs.<br />Mathworks is the sole owner of the product and the software maintenance provider.  Software Maintenance services (SMS) can only be purchased from MathWorks or MathWorks Authorized Resellers.<br />The current software maintenance contract will expire on 12/31/2012.<br />A solicitation will be issued for the renewal of NIST's Mathwork SMS. The period of performance will be for a period of one year.
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541519 with a small business size standard of $25.5 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-13-RQ-0006.</p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Propel Labs, Inc., 131 E. Lincoln Avenue, Suite 200, Fort Collins, CO 80524-4413 for the laser towers, laser steering mirrors which are part of a MoFlo upgrade. The NIA Flow Cytometry Unit, Research Resources Branch, NIA IRP functions as a Shared Resource Laboratory "core" to provide analytical flow cytometry and cell sorting services to NIA IRP investigators and to provide the scientific and technological support to make possible these complex experiments. Flow cytometry is an integral part of evolving biomedical research, driving some of its major advances. The ability to separate heterogeneous populations by flow cytometry is the basic dynamic making possible advances in systems biology, especially the development and application of single-cell transcriptome analysis, molecular profiling, and the integration between cytomics and proteomics. The ability to provide cutting edge flow cytometry in terms of multi-parameter (polychromatic) analysis and sorting is entirely dependent upon technological innovations in the field and our ability to secure these resources. To accommodate the needs of current users and serve as a long-term investment in the flow core, NIA is upgrading the current, obsolete, analog instrument to digital. This upgrade replaces the current electronics components and interfaces that are no longer manufactured and available, if at all, from parts recovered from decommissioned equipment to make the instrument compatible with cutting-edge sorters, NIA is adding violet (405nm) and 531 nm and 565nm lasers.</p>
<p>Propel Labs is the manufacturer of this instruments and the expertise to maintain the validity of the warranty/maintenance agreement with this proprietary scientific instrumentation. The instrument is maintained under a yearly service and new lasers supplied by Propel Labs will be warranted by them. Because of the complexities of these instruments and uniqueness of their parts, none of the other flow cytometers manufacturers' are able to provide equipment/parts/upgrades/services on other's company's instruments.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and falls under FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Primate Aging Database is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community. This will provide a research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process. It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges. This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall transfer the PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the contractor's facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly, provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website, and evaluate all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers. The Contractor shall provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook, fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database, and maintain viewer controls on access to data. In addition, the Contractor shall solicit new data from the research community, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data. The Contractor shall maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss; provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work; and advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.</p>

<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-13-00012
<RESPDATE>110612
<ARCHDATE>12062012
<CONTACT>Gerold Young

<a href="mailto:young.gerold@epa.gov">young.gerold@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase a Laser Based N2O Analyzer to be used in heavy-duty engine testing site 1.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 15.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
Recently, in response to new N2O emission regulations, instrument manufacturers have developed laser based infrared spectrometers in which the source emits infrared radiation in a narrow band width.  This, in turn, eliminates the opportunity for interference as the infrared wavelength emitted by the source is focused in the region where N2O absorbs.
The N2O analyzer will be used for continuous and batch analysis of dilute exhaust gas sampled either directly from a CVS (continuous sampling) or a Kynar bag (batch sampling).  The system will be installed in a heavy-duty engine test site 1 (room 411) at the NVFEL.  This test site is equipped with a Horiba MEXA-7000 system for both continuous and bag analysis of criteria pollutants, and an A&D technology i-Test cell host.   
The full Statement of Work, which will be included in the solicitation, describes and sets forth the installation and analyzer requirements for the N20 analyzer.  The equipment implementation described in the full SOW shall allow for the integration and the ability to fully control the analyzer functions, and data collection, processing and reporting in keeping with the current operation of the i-Test controller.
The procurement will also include an option to purchase an additional analyzer.  The contractor shall offer a complete installed, N2O analyzer meeting all of the requirements of this statement of work for EPA?s heavy-duty test site 2 (room 415).  The system shall be identical to that of heavy-duty test site 1 with the exception of test cell host interface.  Heavy-duty test site 2 is equipped with a Horiba STARS test cell host computer and the analyzer specified under this option shall be integrated to operate with this system.
The cost of the N2O analyzer shall include a standard commercial one-year warranty covering all parts and labor.

<p><br />This Government requirement for leased space was previously posted in a FedBizOpps advertisement referencing Project Number 1DC2080-2.  The purpose of this re-advertisement is to confirm prior Expressions of Interest, update the amount of the Tenant Improvement Allowance, and solicit the market for additional Expressions of Interest.</p>
<p>The Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in LDC01635 that will be expiring on April, 23, 2013.  The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government intends to use the information that it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis that will determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.  The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced.  Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must have the ability to meet all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, handicapped accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection by the required occupancy date.<br /> <br />Expressions of Interest Due:<br />October 29, 2012<br />Market Survey (Estimated):<br />November 25, 2012<br />Offers Due: <br />December 10, 2012<br />Occupancy (Estimated):<br />April 24, 2013</p>
<p><br />EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING NO LATER THAN NOON OCTOBER 29, 2012 AND SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AT A MINIMUM:</p>
<p>Building name and address;<br />Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />Name of closest operational Metro Rail Station and distance in walkable linear feet from the Metro Rail station;<br />ANSI/BOMA defined office area/usable square feet (USF) Offered and  Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered  identifying the specific floors and square footage on each (with Common Area Factor); <br />Rental rate per fully serviced rentable square foot (based on the GSA Warm Lit Shell).

<DESC>Solicitation Number: VA741-12-Q-0214
Document type: Pre-solicitation notice / SYNOPSIS
Posted date: 24 October 2012
NAICS code(s): 611310 - Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools
This is a Pre-solicitation Notice. The contractor in conjunction with Veterans Health Administration Office of Academic Affiliations (OAA) will be responsible for implementing and refining the curriculum and recruitment strategies for the VA Advanced Quality Programs, including the VA Quality Scholars Program (VAQS) and the Chief Resident for Quality and Safety Program (CRQS). These programs are vital components of Veterans Health Administration's statutory mission to provide health professions education to benefit VA and the Nation as they continuing to serve as models to achieve VA's strategic vision for healthcare and health professions education. The contractor is responsible for planning, operating, evaluating and improving these programs. 

The VA Advanced Quality Programs provide in-depth education in assessing and improving healthcare quality and safety for advanced health professionals and scholars. These programs shall produce professionals capable of leading implementation science and practice for quality and safety in VA, academic programs affiliated with VA, and the Nation. VAQS has fulfilled this mission since its inception in 1998 in part through sound initial design of an inter-professional  two-year (with possibility of third year) curriculum and in part through continuous improvement strategies over time. CRQS is a more recent program targeting only physicians and using a one-year curriculum. In 2011, OAA determined that the two programs would be both administered more efficiently and offer stronger programs if the CRQS implemented a consistent national curriculum that is derived from the more in-depth curriculum maintained for VAQS. These programs began prior to VHA's T21 initiatives and does not use T21 earmark funding. However, these programs trained numerous VA staff that were essential to the development and implementation of the T21 initiatives and offer a vital contribution to VA's human capital needs to implement T21 and subsequent transformation.
Healthcare quality and safety are complex disciplines with attributes that are not easily summarized in a document such as this.  These programs are not intended to adhere to any specific theories or models. However, The VA Advanced Quality Programs are expected to develop professionals able to demonstrate competencies in at least the following areas:
Organization and system leadership for healthcare quality and safety
Teaching and learning healthcare quality and safety
Improvement methods and skills
Interprofessional collaboration and teamwork
It is expected that VAQS will expect its participants to demonstrate more in-depth in achievement of some or all of these competencies compared to CRQS participants due to VAQS longer course of study. However the general curricular elements should be generally identical between the two programs, with VAQS achieving many of its objectives through curricular elements providing more extensive mentored practical experiences and projects than the time available in CRQS can allow. As result of participation in these programs, it is expected that alumni of VAQS shall be prepared to advance as leaders in quality and safety practice, scholarship, or education within and beyond VA. Alumni of CRQS shall be prepared to advance quality and safety principles in specialty fields in which they may subsequently train, and to enhance capability of quality and safety practice and education in and beyond VA.

A single award, Firm Fixed-Price Contract is most appropriate to support this effort. The contract Period of Performance (POP) is base year with and 4 one-year option periods with CLINs 0001 are applicable to the Base Period, CLINs 1001 will apply to the first option period, CLINs 2001 for the second option period, CLINs 3001 for the third option period and CLINs 4001 for the fourth and final option period. The full list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, including option(s) are part of the future solicitation

<p>Contractor shall furnish all material, labor and equipment needed to accomplish the work stated<br />below and in accordance with the attached drawings and notes. The specifications in the<br />statement of work for the material and design of the project are the minimum standards that will<br />be met or exceeded by the contractor.</p>
<p>Specifications:<br />Small Tools Needed: socket wrench, 9/16" socket, 1 1/8" socket, 3/4" socket, hammer, 1 1/2" paint brush, Philips screw driver, utility knife, caulk gun Hardware needs: (30) &frac34;" x 2" bolts; (35) &frac34;" nuts; (70) &frac34;" flat washers, (10) 1 &frac12;" #10 sheet metal screws, (5) &frac34;" x 3" bolts for trusses.</p>
<p>Crane service: the crane lift capacity will be determined based on the weight of each half of the duplex, and on the distance the crane will need to swing the load. A professional rigging company should be consulted to make this determination.</p>
<p>Lift hooks: each duplex half has four lift hooks welded to the top (the lift hooks on the center side are recessed into the truss). The hooks are engineered to lift well more than the building weighs. Suggest the rigger use nylon slings to attach to the hooks to lift the unit.</p>
<p>Instructions: Recommend placing the duplex on a concrete or asphalt pad in order to provide a flat and level surface. If pad is uneven, the two halves are more difficult to assemble and cribbing or support shims may be required to level the two halves. Raising and support shimming may be necessary on outside edges or center seam in order to close seam on uneven pads.</p>
<p>1. Unwrap plastic covering. Use 9/16" socket to remove bottom and top brackets holding plastic; then use 1 1/8" socket to remove sides.<br />2. At the top center of each unit there are two lift hooks which are covered with caulk (to prevent water from entering the magazine). Use a utility knife to cut the caulk and then pull the lift hooks up.<br />3. Using the lift hooks, lift first half off truck and place on the pad.<br />4. Remove the center support beam using 1 1/8" socket.<br />5. Lift second half and place it directly facing the other half, approximately 3 feet apart. Remove center support beam.<br />6. Lift second half and place it next to the first half. Line up bolt holes as close as possible. There are bolt holes on each end, in the center support truss, and in the floor.<br />Sources Sought for Arms Room (UAE)<br />7. Install bolts in all holes and secure with nuts. Tighten nuts after all bolts have been installed.<br />8. There are two boards supplied that need to be nailed to the end seams on the inside of the duplex.<br />9. Some units are supplied with an aluminum threshold. If supplied, this goes over the center seam on the floor. Use #10 1 &frac12;" tapered Phillips sheet metal screw. If no threshold is supplied, caulking the seam with 100% silicone caulk is suggested.<br />10. Caulk the outside edge of the seam at the top of the duplex and on the outside seam of both sides. Lower the 4 center lift hooks into their housing and then caulk the housing. Suggest 100% silicone caulk.<br />11. After top seam and lift hook housings are caulked, pull roof cap into place over top of seam.<br />12. Inside the duplex is a flex hose which needs to be connected. This hose carries the wiring which connects the power of both halves.<br />13. Touch up paint is supplied and can be used if needed. Mixing instructions and an MSDS sheet is also supplied. The paint is mixed in a 3:1 ratio resin to activator. NOTE - paint sets up in as little as 30-45 minutes in some climates. Once mixed do not let paint stand more than 30 minutes.<br />14. Ground rods are to be installed by a qualified electrician. Generally, the 10' copper rod is to be connected to the supplied copper cable. The cable is then attached to the duplex ground bracket. Typically, ground rods are to be driven into the ground so that the top of the rod is at least 1' below grade level. Consult NEC codes in your area for specific instructions.<br />Options<br />1. If anchor brackets are attached to outside corners of duplex, they must be bolted into place using a &frac34;" x 7" anchor bolt. Must drill a 3/4" hole 5" deep with a concrete bit before inserting the bolt.<br />2. If the duplex is equipped with a ramp it should be installed as follows: lift ramp up and align with brackets welded beneath door. Insert &frac12;" x 2" bolts, a flat washer on both sides of the bolt, and a lock nut.<br />Specifications are considered to be binding to the contractor and are part of the contract<br />documents. The contractor is responsible for reading and understanding the specifications. If the contractor does not have any of the listed specifications, a copy will be provided to him by the Contract Specialist upon request. Copies of the specifications are valid only if dated as listed and are signed and sealed by a USA professional engineer.

<DESC>SLAC's location is 2575 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, CA 94025. PEP stands for the Positron-Electron-Project, a high-energy physics research, approximately one mile in circumference, particle accelerator. PEP contained two rings in a common, underground tunnel to collide electrons which were accelerated in the HER ring and positrons which were accelerated in the LER ring. SLAC decommissioned PEP in 2008. SLAC is currently dismantling the facility to prepare the infrastructure for a potential future accelerator. This document focuses on the removal and storage of the dipole corrector magnets used in the HER and LER accelerator rings.
<p><br />The Subcontractor's scope of work is generally to: <br />1. Unbolt approximately six hundred (600) corrector magnets from their supports in the HER and LER rings. <br />SLAC will provide a more precise magnet quantity in a future request for quote (RFQ). <br />2. As necessary, split each magnet for removal from the beam line. <br />3. Carefully recombine the parts from the magnet, and tag it with a SLAC name. <br />4. Place the magnets onto wooden pallets (supplied by the subcontractor), stack them, and store them at an <br />onsite location not yet identified.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>

<p>(f) Reserved</p>
<p>(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

<DESC>In support of its mission, WMDC needs to acquire a vendor to deliver up to three (3) Senior Executive Assessment Program (SEAP) training sessions for FY13. The SEAP Program is a four and a half day intensive assessment and readiness program designed to assess career Federal executive performance potential, determine readiness to go through the Federal executive selection process (including interviewing and obtaining SES --Senior Executive Service-- certification), and provide a realistic job preview of what life in the Federal executive ranks is like so participants can make an informed decision about whether being a career Federal executive is the right career path to take. This program provides a comfortable, secure environment in which participants can assess their current potential to be a career Federal executive and then develop a tailored action plan for leadership development at the executive level.
<p>Note: The SEAP program employs a behavioral Assessment Center (AC) process that provides for real-time (observed) assessment of performance on key competencies needed by Federal executives. Participants receive a confidential debrief on their performance in the AC, and specifically to what degree they appeared to be operating at an executive level. The entire AC process will be contracted out through a separate solicitation. The AC process, at a maximum, may take up to the entire participant day on Day 2, and may use a quarter day of participant time on Day 4. The Day 4 morning, if used, would be a split track, with half the participants receiving an AC debrief in the first half of the morning, while the other half of the class receives an in-class module as part of the design from this solicitation. In the second half of the morning the two tracks are reversed. As such, this RFQ is for a total of 28 hours of SEAP in-class training time, broken out as 8 hours of training on Days 1, 3 and 4, and 4 hours of training on Day 5.<br />The primary competencies are Interpersonal Skills, Problem Solving, Strategic Thinking, Team Building and Visioning. <br />The instructional strategies include video clips, classroom lecture; case studies and experiential simulations. See www.leadership.opm.gov for more course information.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Tab A - Experience Provide detailed narrative descriptions of a minimum of three and a maximum of ten wave attenuator projects that your firm has performed in the last ten years which are similar to this project in size, scope, climate, and dollar value.  Work must be self-performed to be considered for experience. 
Evaluation Criteria: The SSEB will evaluate both the extent and quality of experience identified in the quotation.  Documentation of successful completion of projects similar in size, scope and dollar value to this project will be considered to have met the minimum requirements of the RFP.  Conversely, proposals that do not include substantial evidence that the offeror has experience, qualifications and production capability to successfully complete the proposed project will be considered to not meet the minimum requirements of the RFP.  Additional consideration (listed in order of importance) may be given for projects that demonstrate the provision and installation of wave attenuator systems, and demonstrate a previous working experience with the National Park Service. Work must be self-performed to be considered for experience.
Tab B - Past Performance Provide valid and current reference information for each project submitted for prior experience.  Reference information should include project name, location, and owner's name, owner's contact person and contact numbers for the owner's contact person.  Failure to provide valid and current reference contacts and contact information will be considered non-responsive to this requirement.   It is the offeror's responsibility to provide current contacts that have been verified as valid prior to the submission of a quotation for this project.  Offeror's will not be contacted to provide correct or additional source data.  
Evaluation Criteria: The SSEB will evaluate the degree of successful completion of the experience identified in the proposal.  Documentation of satisfactory past performance of projects similar in size, scope, and dollars will be considered to have met the minimum requirements of the RFP.  Conversely, offers which do not achieve satisfactory performance will be considered to not meet the minimum requirements of the RFP.  The Government reserves the right to check any or all cited references to verify supplied information and to assess owner satisfaction.  The Government may also use other tools such as CPS, CPAR, CCASS, ACASS, PPIMS, Dun & Bradstreet, etc. or any other relevant information to assist in its evaluation of an offeror's past performance.
Tab C- Technical approach Describe in detailed narrative form how the offeror proposes to fulfill the requirement from a technical standpoint, and particularly with the particular product offered. 
Evaluation Criteria: The SSEB will evaluate the technical approach for the firms understanding of the technical requirements and the planned method of fabrication and installation of the Wave attenuator system.  Approaches that demonstrate a clear understanding of the work and an ability to perform the work will be considered to meet the RFP requirements.  Narratives that do not demonstrate a clear understanding of the work, that do not demonstrate a well thought out plan of fabrication and installation of the wave attenuator system will be considered not to meet the RFP requirements.  Technical approaches that are confusing, vague, or cluttered with undecipherable narratives or missing work elements will be considered not to meet the RFP requirements. 

Tab D - Management approach Submit a narrative summary describing how the offeror's company will manage this project.  The approach should include details on how the offeror will manage the project requirements, including that of supplier, any subcontractor, crews, equipment, Quality Control, Quality Assurance, Safety (including accident prevention),  and meeting delivery schedules. Offeror shall provide a project specific Organizational chart and a project schedule demonstrating the activities and their associated timelines from the Notice to Proceed through project completion.  The required date for site installation is June 1, 2013.
Evaluation criteria: The evaluation board will evaluate the management approach.  Approaches that demonstrate a clear understanding of the work and an ability to coordinate resources to ensure successful pursuit and completion of the work will be considered to meet the RFP requirements.  Narratives that do not demonstrate a clear understanding of the work, that do not demonstrate a capability to coordinate resources, or do not demonstrate appropriate excess capacity will be considered not to meet the RFP requirements.  The SSEB will evaluate the clarity, adequacy, capabilities and strengths of the offeror's organizational chart for managing a successful project.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-13-Q-0088 is being issued as an unrestricted Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Sioux Center, Iowa, for a Base Year period 12/1/2012 - 11/30/2013 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the Iowa Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications - on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

All offerors must carefully review the delivery requirement in the request for quote or solicitation. When submitting an offer/bid, please ensure that you can meet the delivery schedule. <br /><br />On time delivery is very critical. Therefore, offerors must adhere to the delivery requirements indicated in any resultant award. Failure to comply with the contractual delivery schedule, may result in termination of the order or require consideration if the government elects to extend delivery. The Government is not required to extend your delivery schedule if you encounter delays. The non-availability of raw materials, subcontractor issues, scheduling conflicts, etc., should be considered at the time you are submitting your offer/bid. They are not acceptable excuses for failing to meet the delivery after award. <br /><br />Ensuring that you can provide quality products that conform to the contract is just as important as meeting the required delivery schedule. Delivery of non-conforming products results in delivery delays and increased costs to the Government. <br /><br />Please note that if you receive this award, your performance under this contract (including timeliness of deliveries and the quality of supplies/services delivered) will be monitored and recorded by this contracting office. This information may be used to determine a record of past performance for future contract awards. Contractors/offerors that are concerned about their record of past performance may contact this office if they wish to view and discuss their records.<br /><br />EVALUATION OF AWARD <br /><br />(1) Price: The Government will evaluate quotes based on prices quoted in the paragraph (v) of this solicitation. <br /><br />(2) Past Performance: This factor will be based on information obtained from any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. Data maintained by this contracting office may include an offeror's record of performance on previous contracts issued by this contracting office. Quotes received from vendors with no past performance history information will be evaluated based on information obtained from various sources, such as contracting agency experience with the contractor, previous contract history available from DCMA, etc. The Government does not intend to discuss any negative Past Performance data with offerors, if that data is contained in the JMTC contracting office's own records on past contract performance, or PPIRS-SR database. <br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, based on an integrated analysis of each offeror's Past Performance and Price. The final award decision will be a trade-off between Past Performance and price, with the Past Performance factor being more important than price.<br /><br />The Government will develop a Past Performance rating for each offeror, based on the Past Performance information described above. This may include numerically-generated scores (such as PPIRS-SR), narrative information contained in this contracting office's own databases, or descriptions provided by references. The contracting officer will analyze this information and develop an adjectival rating, going from "Low Risk" to "Medium Risk" and finally "High Risk". Offerors who have no past performance information will be assigned a "Neutral Risk" rating.<br /><br />The contracting officer will perform a trade-off analysis based on the assigned Past Performance rating and price for each proposal. In determining the best value to the Government, award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal. While the Past Performance factor is more important than price, the price factor may become controlling as Past Performance ratings tend to equalize. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUOTE SUBMISSION<br /><br />The Government intends to make an award based on a best value basis. This process will involve a trade-off analysis, if applicable, between Price and Performance Risk. This may result in award to other than the low quote and/or other than the highest rated (best performance risk) quote. <br /><br />For the evaluation of Performance Risk, the Government will obtain information from the any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. You are not required to submit any additional information on Performance Risk. The Government does not intend to discuss performance risk information with the offerors.<br /><br />FAR 30.202-1(a) DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FORM<br /><br />Disclosure Statement, Form CASB-DS-1, is not included in this solicitation<br />package. Any offeror meeting the criteria for concurrent submission of the<br />Disclosure Statement, who has not previously received the form from another Government source, will immediately contact the cognizant ACO (See DOD Directory of Contract Administration Components (DOD 4105.59H)) to obtain a copy of the form.

SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/. Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages. For any additional questions or help, please visit the SAM Help Desk which can be accessed by selecting the Help Tab at the top of the SAM homepage.</p>

For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below: (1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities. (2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is applicable, with an assigned rating of DO-A1. A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOpps on 1 March 2012, where more than two small businesses responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements. Based on this and other Market Research, a determination was made to set the effort aside 100% for Small Business. Therefore, only qualified Small Business offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management for a full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required to support the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. The Army has a requirement to sustain/maintain the 1798 RQ-11B and 325 RQ-20A systems currently fielded, and alternative medium and long range systems procured in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighters as well as other Governmental<br />Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users' SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs<br />primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various non-SETA logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers. The approximate percentage of effort in each area of focus is: Flight Training - 60%, Contractor Logistics - 35%, Technical/Program Management - 5%.</p>
<p>Complete individual instructor flight packets shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal for evaluation by the PM UAS GFR. Instructor flight packets will include the following four items: two DD forms 1821 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 4, AR 95-20); Crewmember resume; two DD Forms 2627 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 3, AR 95-20); FAA Medical Certification (Class 3 or higher). Note: Offerors shall provide with their proposal no less than fourteen (14) Individual Instructor Flight Packets for proposed GFR Certified instructors. The resume portion of the packet shall indicate if the person is a current employee or a contingency hire upon award.</p>
<p>SUAS Trainers shall be certified on all SUAS products available from the Army inventory (currently RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma). While the below table is not a training schedule, it provides the minimum workforce required in the post-award period. The offerors shall be able to show its ability to reach these workforce levels. For example, 14 GFR-certified Puma trainers will be required for various training missions in MAY 2013 (6 in OEF, 8 in CONUS). In JUNE 2013, the required Puma trainers will increase from 14 to18, and 10 Raven trainers will also be required. This escalation continues until 22 Puma trainers, and 22 Raven trainers are available to conduct the anticipated maximum training density (total of 44 interchangeable trainers). <br />Note: actual training schedules will be published as a formal requirement in subsequent Task Orders, post-IDIQ award. The below table is not to be interpreted as a schedule, and as such it is not guaranteed that the maximum training density will be required in August or September, etc.</p>
<p>Training Workforce Needed (Time Phased Escalation)<br /><br />MAY (begins on 29 APR)<br />14 Puma<br />0&nbsp; Raven<br />14 Total<br /><br />JUNE<br />18 Puma<br />10 Raven<br />28 Total<br />&nbsp;<br />JULY<br />22 Puma<br />14 Raven<br />36 Total<br />&nbsp;<br />AUGUST <br />22 Puma<br />22 Raven<br />44 Total<br /><br />SEPTEMBER&nbsp;<br />22 Puma<br />22 Raven<br />44 Total<br /><br />Etc...&nbsp;<br /><br />*Note: Trainers will be interchangeable, and must be certified on both Raven and Puma</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />A Single award, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is most appropriate to support this effort. The contract Period of Performance (PoP) is five years with a Base Period of three years, and 2 one-year option periods with CLINS 0001-00XX are applicable to the Base Period, CLINS 1001-10XX will apply to the first option period, and CLINS 2001-20XX will apply to the last option period. The full list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, including option(s) are part of the future solicitation. Specific date(s) and place(s) of delivery, acceptance and FOB point will be specified in the individual Task orders. The IDIQ contract award is currently scheduled for April 2013, and shall have a cumulative ceiling of $99M for all orders.</p>

<DESC>Modification 1:

The pre-solicitation notice issued on October 1, 2012 is modified to include the following:

1.  Contractors' questions and Government responses are provided in the attached file for information purposes.

2.  The following paragraphs (located after selection criterion 9) are changed to read as follows:
 
From:  

For selection criteria (1) and (2):
A military headquarters facility is considered to be a facility that accommodates executive and staff functions of a general officer command.   An operations control center is considered to be a command, control and coordination area in direct support of the operational mission of a general officer command.  A general officer command is an organization within the U.S.
 Department of Defense that is commanded by a general officer.  A general officer is an officer appointed by the President of the United States to a rank higher than colonel (Army, Air Force, Marine Corps) or Captain (Navy).  A project is considered to be a stand-alone contract or a single task order under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  A relevant project is new construction or major renovation of an existing military headquarters or operational control center, approximately 300,000  400,000 SF in building size, with an estimated construction cost of between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000, which included complexities such as phased construction, construction while portions of the facility are occupied, and construction involving historic structures.
  Major renovation is considered to be substantial restoration or modernization work totaling at least 50 percent of the replacement value of the facility.  Additions to military headquarters or Operations Control Centers will not be considered relevant, unless the addition itself is within the range of building size, construction cost, and included complexities noted above for a relevant project. 

Projects including both a military headquarters and an operations control center will be given more favorable consideration than projects including only a military headquarters or an operations control center.  Projects that were performed in a remote, resource-constrained environment with logistical challenges, similar to those faced by construction projects in Hawaii, will be given more favorable consideration.
  In addition, military headquarters or operations facilities designed for tropical environments similar to Hawaii will be considered more favorably.  The intent is to ensure quality of design and construction and thereby extend the economic life of shore facilities in an environment considered aggressive because of constant sun, rain, salt-laden air, and humidity; frequent high winds, earthquakes, lightning storms, and other detrimental environmental aspects.  Tropical environments are considered to occur in the tropical region, which is considered to cover a broad band of the earth's surface bordering the equator from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer.

<p>New Sustainable Building Technologies--Green Proving Ground 2013 Program</p>
<p>The General Service Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather information from commercial organizations, educational institutions and non-profit organizations on new sustainable building technologies and practices in support of its Green Proving Ground (GPG) initiative.</p>

More specifically, the GPG program aims to identify technologies with the greatest potential to help meet GSA's mandated sustainability goals, particularly those contained in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance", and assess their performance in the in the real world context of operating buildings.  Notable findings from all projects will support the evolution of performance specifications for the GSA portfolio and will inform decision making at GSA, other federal agencies, and the industry in deploying the technologies studied.</p>
<p>Commercial entities, educational institutions and non-profit organizations  wishing to participate in GSA's GPG 2013 Program, including those who have previously submitted information for past years' programs, must complete the questionnaire at:<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=bz89x8971l09n" target="_blank">http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=bz89x8971l09n</a></span>&nbsp;. The GPG Program may review and consider submitted technologies for enhanced Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) as part of the 2013 program.  To be selected, innovative products can be (1) gifted (unconditionally) or (2) provided to GSA for testing through the use of an agreement and a payment of a fee to GSA.  Additional information may subsequently be requested.</p>

Information received may be used to assist GSA in creating an RFP and may be shared with other Federal agencies. Respondents are advised not to include any confidential business information with a response as the Government does not guarantee confidentiality of the information received.

Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 20 - 260 - NCO Contract Office intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 20 - 260 - NCO Contract Office is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. technical specifications, etc.) may be requested, pricing shall be entered in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the awardee may be required to complete the solicitation documents at the time of award. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

If FedBid receives notice that, due to inclusion of the FedBid Fee, the Selected Bid's line item pricing is higher than the Selected Seller's applicable published government contract pricing, the FedBid Fee will be reduced to ensure the Selected Bid's line item pricing does not exceed the Selected Seller's applicable contract pricing. Sellers may offer Open Market items only in accordance with the approved Terms and Conditions of their respective GSA/FSS Schedule AND upon approval from the soliciting Contracting Officer.
