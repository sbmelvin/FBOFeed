This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of VMware license upgrades to Enterprise for existing VMware licenses and software.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO owns and has in use VMware software and licenses.   VMware is virtualization software that virtualizes servers, storage and networking, allowing multiple unmodified operating systems and their applications to run independently in virtual machines while sharing physical resources.  The upgrade will allow users to perform automatic failover in the event that a server crashes.  The upgrade will also provide virtual server backup and limited physical to virtual capabilities.  This allows users to take certain applications that exist on physical servers and move them to virtual servers.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to upgrade to VMware Infrastructure Enterprise.  Failure to do so at this time will impede the Bureau’s ability to perform automatic failover in the event that a server crashes. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Due to CA’s investment and overall satisfaction with this toolset, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other software at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. VMware upgrades are the only effective upgrades for VMware software and licenses.<BR><BR>

Provide the name(s) of at least one individual (but not more than three) that will be assigned as your Defense Contractor Representative for CPARS.  (d)  Additionally the Government in conducting source selection may access Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).  This system provides timely and pertinent contractor past performance information for use in making source selection decisions. PPIRS assist Federal acquisition officials make source selections by serving as the single source for contractor past performance data. Past performance information includes, for example, the contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects o!  f performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Confidence in a prospective contractor's ability to satisfactorily perform contract requirements is an important factor in making best value decisions in the acquisition of goods and services.  Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered.  (e)  Contractors may view only their own data at www.ppirs.gov.  Contractor access to PPIRS is gained through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) process. A contractor must be registered in CCR and must have created a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) in the CCR profile to access !  their PPIRS information.  Offerors must be registered in the Central C ontractor Registration (CCR).  Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Note # 12 applies to this procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The Northwest Portland Ares Indian Health Board to expand on the Northwest Tribal Registry Project (NWTR) to continue its activities to ascertain more accurate estimates of the occurrence of cancer among Northwest American Indians and Alaskan Natives and to expand and enhance the composition of the Registry (e.g., inclusion of patient rosters from the Seattle IHB) to improve its completeness and representativeness.  

The unique opportunity exists to identify cancer health disparities among AIAN in one of the larger regions of the country. The Northwest Tribal Registry Project serves the upper northwest region of the U.S. and is the central point for data linkage for over 40 Indian tribes. It was developed in January 1999 as part of a tribally operated epidemiology program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) in Portland, Oregon.  The Registry Project uses state of the art record linkage studies to increase the quality of health status surveillance data, especially for chronic diseases such as cancer, for AI/AN in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

The ability to provide more complete and accurate cancer data for Northwest AI/AN is dependent upon the successful and mutually beneficial relationships that have developed between this organization, its tribal members, and the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington State Cancer Registries.  From December 2003 to March 2007, the NPAIHB conducted repeat data linkages with all three state registries to obtain complete data through 2004.  No other entity has such a relationship with the three state cancer registries and the Native American tribal governments in the Northwest Portland Area.

The Northwest Tribal Registry (NWTR) collected complete data from 1996-2004 for Idaho, Oregon and Washington. By virtue of the linkages with the Tribal Registry, the registry identified over 3,000 incident AI/AN cancer cases for analysis during the nine-year period. The Registry Project has analyzed these linkages, including residual cases (i.e., those cases for which an individual is classified as AI/AN in the state cancer registry, but for which there is no record in the Tribal Registry), and using U.S. Census estimates (specifically the National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race estimates) as denominators, thus allowing for an even more comprehensive description of cancer burden among Northwest AI/AN.  These data have been analyzed in preparation for development of publications to be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.  No entity other than the NPAIHB Registry has access to these data or the analyses.  No other single institution meets the criteria necessary to participate in this project.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M. 


This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 19, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  For further information please contact Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at dm170b@nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Tera Sinclair, 586-574-5225
<DESC>The U.S. ARMY TACOM LCMC, Product Managers Office, Light Tactical Vehicles (PM LTV), Warren, MI, intends to solicit on a sole source basis with AM General Corporation (AMG) for ten (10) test vehicles - two (2) armored and three (3) unarmored for two configurations, and test support. The two configurations are a two (2) person vehicle (operationally similar to the M1113/M11 52 ) and a four (4) person vehicle (operationally similar to the M1151/M1165). The Government is interested in achieving improved vehicle performance, payload protection and crew survivability, within the current Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Block II requirements. Desired characteristics may include: increased engine horsepower (potentially a new engine, power train), torq ue; other improved components such as transmissions, wheel/tire assembly, power steering pump, and brakes.  There is no requirement to use the current HMMWV chassis and commonality is not required.  Although standardizing improvements into the existing fle et of HMMWVs is desirable it is not required.  Maximum leverage of the existing HMMWV support structure is encouraged. Test assets are required to be at the test site (Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG)) no later than 2 January 2008 and will be tested to the Block II requirements of the HMMWV ORD, dated 17 SEP 04. Vehicles will also be tested for occupant protection against mine blast, IED, and ballistic threats. The intent of this action is to demonstrate improvement above the curren t HMMWV platform to bridge current capability gaps.  This Synopsis/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements and delivery listed above, may give written notification to the Contra cting Officer not later than 15 days from the date of this publication.  If the test results of these vehicles are successful, the Government intends to pursue on a sole source basis the acquisition of future production vehicles.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the maintenance of BlueCoat Appliances and software support.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the BlueCoat product as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The maintenance listed above is required to support the Department’s mission critical operating environment and its data from harmful attacks and viruses.  The BlueCoat software aids in the process of content filtering for unauthorized sites as well as filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State’s mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>1940 US Federal Census (RFI Questions and Answers)

The following questions were submitted in response to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Request for Information, dated 07/17/2007, asking for assistance in developing requirements for a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the indexing, duplication, and distribution of the 1940 Population and Housing Census, which is scheduled to be released Monday April 2, 2012.

All further questions should be submitted to Paul Premoe via e-mail at paul.premoe@nara.gov.  The Government will not accept questions after 4PM on September 13, 2007.

We hope the answers to the following questions will contain useful information.  There is no separate budget item for FY08.  We envision doing the re-formatting of the microfilm in-house using our own equipment.  Our concerns relate to indexing and distribution.

1) Is this a COTS solution? No.

2) If there going to be a Vendor Day or Bidders conference?  Most likely but one has not been planned because we are not at that stage yet.

3) Have the requirements for this project been defined yet?  Not completely.  That is the reason for the RFI.

4) When is the purchase decision going to be made?  Our best guess is that the RFP will go out in FY08 and a selection will be made shortly after the close of the bidding period.

5) Do you have requirements yet, if so can you share them with us?  The RFI is as far as we have defined the project.  See questions below for more specific answers.

6) If there is any other miscellaneous information about this program?  You can look at the NARA public web page, www.archives.gov particularly those pages dealing with our genealogy program.  Non-government web sites containing earlier genealogical and prior Federal Population Census information include www.ancestry.com .

7) I presume that on April 2, 2012 NARA will be selling microfilm copies of the 1940 census, and that images of the 1940 census will also be freely available for downloading/crawling from the NARA website?  That is not correct.  NARA has no plans to make and sell microfilm copies of the 1940 Census.  The images will be available on-line one way or another.

8) Will pre-orders be taken for the film?  No.  We are not making microfilm copies of the original microfilm.

9) I assume that NARA?s ability to charge a royalty is based on the principle of ?cost of creation? that is needed for the imaging, in order to get the indexing done?   We are not familiar with the phrase ?cost of creation?.  However, NARA already has royalty agreements with other private enterprises which distribute reproductions of NARA images.  These royalties, paid to the National Archives Trust Fund, are used to support other archival programs.  Obviously, NARA is incurring an extra cost by merely duplicating the microfilm.

10) Is the proposed royalty to be paid on hard goods only, and not based on online usage of the images?  The royalty is envisioned to be paid on sets of images and related indexes sold on a hard media like a DVD or CD or sent via FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL or similar medium.  Predicting 5 years out, it is not clear what kinds of files transfer media will be in common use so we will in our requirements define such sales generically.  For example, if a customer wants to purchase a set of images and indexes for the State of Ohio and a license to use same, a royalty would be payable.  We do not envision asking for a royalty for individual on-line usage that is based on a subscription held by that individual.

11) What is NARA?s estimated imaging costs?  Approximately $500,000 to image and create a based line index by roll number, State, Enumeration District, County, and City (where appropriate). Will royalties cease after this amount has been reached?  After a certain period of time, the images, the related metadata, and a copy of the index will become NARA?s without restriction on use, and at that point no further royalties will be needed. After the end of royalty period, NARA might be open to entering into a contract to continue distribution such as we did with the 1930 Census.

12) Will the digital images be made available on NARA?s site and on the winning party?s site.  If so, will it need to be free in both locations?  Yes, the images will be available on both sites.  However, only the winning party?s web site will have the index until the end of the agreed upon royalty period.  At NARA research facilities, the public will be able to access the records AND the index for free.

13) Why would NARA not want the vendor to digitize the film for free, with no cost to NARA?  For security reasons related to complying with requirements of Title 13, U.S. Code, we want to limit the number of persons cleared to handle the original records.

14) Is there doubt that NARA will require the name index to be created prior to the release date?  (see ?If name index is done prior to release date, it must be done within the US.?)  No, we expect that the winning party will complete the name index before the release date.

15) I assume that the indexes will only be available on the winning party?s site? (see ?NARA will not permit the copying of any part of the index while using NARA'S website or at NARA location during the period of the agreement.?)  The index will also be available at all NARA research facilities at no charge to the public or to NARA staff.

16) Does the ?right to fulfill orders for segments of the index? refer to indexes created and sold on CD/DVD by the winning party?  Yes, that is one way parts of the index could be sold, presumably using some form of copy-proof media.

17) Why must the information be keyed in the U.S.? Can the entity managing the process be in the U.S. and the keying vendor outside the U.S.?  The Census Bureau has told NARA that under no circumstances would it permit the Census records to be duplicated or indexed outside the United States.  The Census records are restricted until they are 72 years old.  As it is, anyone handling the Census records before their official release date MUST have Special Sworn Status (SSS), which requires a review of the handling requirements and an annual update.

18) How would you determine what a ?reasonable subscription fee? would be? I assume that you are not requiring 1940 to be a stand-alone subscription?  What is reasonable is a decision that must be made by the individual enterprise.  The subscription can be stand-alone or offered as a part of a larger product.

19) When is NARA expecting to release an RFP?  Sometime during FY08.  If a party has not replied to the RFI can they still reply to the RFP?  Yes.

20) How many names are included in the full 1940 release? The population in 1940 was approximately 132 million and there were approximately 37 million housing units, which is the closest we can come to number of households.  The source of this information is the Census Bureau?s web site.

21) What fields is NARA looking to have indexed? Roll Number, State, County, Enumeration District (ED), City, Head of Household

22) In reviewing the background for this requirement, I didn't see an estimate for an approximate budget for this project.  I've looked through the Exhibits 53 and 300 as well as the FY2008 budget posted for NARA on the OMB site.  I understand that as part of the project NARA wants to recoup its costs via royalties.  Is there any guidance you can provide or information you can point me to that might be available?  The questions relating to royalties are discussed in above.  See questions 9, 10, 11, and 12.  There is no separate budget item in the FY08 budget because the costs of re-formatting the records will be done using existing staff and equipment that is expected to be ordered in the near future.  We are planning this project so that our costs are limited and that responsibility for indexing, the most expensive part of the project, will be borne by the winning enterprise which stands to profit by being the sole on-line distributor of the information for a period of time yet to be determined.






Background:


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Among these records are the Decennial Population (and Housing) Censuses, created by the Bureau of the Census, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.



The objective of this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice (RFI) is to determine whether any non-profit or for-profit entities are interested in forming a partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to provide electronic access to the records of the 1940 Decennial Census of Population and Housing in 2012, and under what terms such a partnership might be established.  The nature of this partnership is described below.  The Decennial Population Census has been taken every 10 years since 1790 by the Bureau of the Census.  Under Title 13, United States Code, these records are restricted from public disclosure, except for aggregated statistical data without personal identifiers, until such a time as the individual privacy rights of those identified in the census forms, known as schedules, have expired.  The date when the information can be released to the public has been determined to be 72 years from the date of the Census.



NARA has a statutory obligation not only to make these records available but also to sell complete copies of the 1940 census.  In previous releases of decennial census records, copies of microfilm rolls containing the census records were sold by NARA.  Along with the Census schedules are so-called Soundex rolls that served as an index to some of the schedules.  There are Soundex rolls for the 1880 through 1920 Censuses, and a partial Soundex for the 1930 Census.  There is no Soundex for the 1940 and later Censuses. In recent years, private for-profit companies have purchased the Census microfilm from NARA and digitized the microfilm to make it available to researchers using the Internet, along with other Federal and non-Federal records and databases of genealogical interest.  The public has now come to expect that such records are readily available and searchable by name via the Internet.  In accordance with NARA's Strategic Plan, NARA plans to make available digital copies of the census records.  


Goal 4 of the strategic Plan states: 


We will provide prompt, easy, and secure access to our holdings anywhere, anytime; and  
NARA has identified 2 applicable strategies to achieve this goal. 
A. For the broadest possible access, we will make digital copies of selected non-electronic records available online.  We will identify these holdings in a digitization plan that sets priorities for putting these holdings online. 
B. We will work to establish partnerships with both governmental and private institutions to facilitate the availability of NARA holdings over the Internet, in accordance with appropriate Government laws, regulations, policy, and guidance. 


The strategic plan also contains specific language that addresses digitization.  It says that NARA will work to digitize selected records, including those most requested by researchers, and will put searchable descriptions of all our holdings online with clear information about the archival context of the original records and how they may be located and used. 


The strategic plan is available online at: http://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/.

Description
Request for Information (RFI) for the 1940 Decennial Population Census Digital Reformatting and Access Project


The following information describes the scope of the project:


Original Records: 4,643 rolls of 35mm microfilm
Existing Index: None.  A name index must be created.


Records Security: Access to records is restricted by Title 13, USC.  All handling of records must follow Census Bureau's security requirements and procedures.  These requirements include having every person with access to Census information swear in writing (Special Sworn Status) that they will never release any information on the Census to anyone else until the date of official public release (see below).
Limits on Indexing: If name index is done prior to release date, it must be done within the US.


Release Date: April 2, 2012


Type of Re-formatting: Digitization, 8-bit gray scale, to be by NARA staff.


NARA plans to digitize the records in-house using NARA staff.  This is for both cost and security reasons.  NARA will also prepare the electronic equivalent of roll lists, which more broadly identify the records by State and County or City.  Currently we have made no decisions about creating or purchasing other finding aids such as those we made available for the 1930 Census, such as color reproductions of enumeration district (ED) maps or city directories.


NARA is looking for a partner to create a searchable name index to the microfilm in exchange for the right to fulfill orders for segments of the index and the right to charge a reasonable subscription fee to institutions and individuals for access to the index.  Access to the digitized records will remain free.  The number and type of data fields or elements to be captured by the index must be addressed in the response to the RFI.  The estimated cost of producing the index must be included as part of any response to the RFI.


Access to the records and the complete index will be provided free of charge at NARA'S Archives I facility in Washington, DC, and at all of the NARA regional archives facilities where Census microfilm is available.  These regional facilities are located in Waltham, MA (suburban Boston); Pittsfield, MA; New York City; Philadelphia; Morrow, GA (suburban Atlanta); Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO; Ft. Worth, TX; Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; San Bruno, CA (suburban San Francisco); Laguna Niguel, CA (Orange Co., CA); and Anchorage, AK.  Under the terms of any agreement, NARA will not permit the copying of any part of the index while using NARA'S website or at NARA location during the period of the agreement but will expect that its patrons will be permitted free access and print capability during their visit.  The digital images of the Census will be available for free on the Internet to all users but it is understood that without the index, the images themselves are of very limited research value.


NARA is interested in recouping its costs to digitize the microfilm and therefore will expect that a royalty fee will be paid by the concessionaire based on the gross revenue of sales of partial indexes and copies of the images on DVD or other hard electronic media.


This RFI is the first step that NARA plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation. 


Response Instructions 


NARA requests that responses are submitted in Microsoft Word format or if necessary, other products from the Microsoft Suite.  Briefly describe your company or institution, your products, past and current projects, and current services, history, ownership, financial information, the number of employees, and other information you deem relevant.  Please provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number, and email.  You are encouraged to provide comments on the 1940 Population Census Re-formatting and Access Project approach.  Respond only if you can provide the total solution to this project.  Discuss technically feasible alternatives and provide non-binding order of magnitude cost and schedule estimates. Indicate whether your solution or product is commercially available or is on the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule.  Supplemental product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may also be submitted.  Furthermore, please include substantive responses to the following:


1) Understanding that indexing cannot be conducted outside the United States and that anyone with access to any part of the Census before its public release date must have Special Sworn Status: a) what work processes will you employ to create a name index and (b) how would you ensure that the Census Bureau's security requirements are met while the records are in your custody?


2) Do you believe there will be a market for copies of or access to partial indexes by State or other geographic subdivision, and why?  What is your strategy for tapping into that market?


3) If granted a "concession" to be the exclusive distributor of copies of the 1940 Census to the public, how many years do you anticipate having a need for the concession?  Explain why you need the concession for that period of time.


4) In order to re-coup its expenses, NARA anticipates charging a royalty as part of the "concession" agreement.  Do you provide royalties to other archives or libraries and how are they determined?


5) Discuss the potential data storage requirements for this project and your capacity to both store and provide public access via the Internet.


6) Provide feedback on our requirements.  Specifically provide comments on any requirements that you believe cannot be implemented.  Describe how you would organize the requirements so that both NARA and your company or organization can make the 1940 Census publicly available at a reasonable cost and still receive sufficient compensation to offset the cost of providing the records digitally.


7) Identify possible constraints or potential risks.


8) What tools and metrics do you use to measure system performance?


9) Describe your IT security program.


10) Describe the type of contractual agreement and pricing structure that you envision.


11) Describe your disaster recovery program.


12) Would your firm or organization be interested in giving an informational presentation to the NARA?

The selection process shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, Subpart 36.6, Performance-Based Contracting, and the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-852). Clarifications may be requested at any time.  The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase: during which the SF330 will be evaluated against the selection factor 1-5 listed below to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

The letter notifying those firms selected for the short list will contain an appointment for one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in the Region?s offices and shall not take longer than two (2) hours.

Each firm is responsible for ensuring that any required presentation tools and personnel are available and working properly for their presentation.  During the oral presentation, the short-listed firms may be requested to provide further clarification concerning their submission.  After oral presentations, the firms will be evaluated and ranked, based on the information presented in their Phase II submission and Oral presentation. 

Selection factor 1-6 listed below will be used for making the final selection(s).  

Unsuccessful firms and firms selected for negotiation of a contract will be notified.

Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection and will proceed until sufficient awards have been made.

Selection Factor:
Six (6) factor will be used in the selection of firms.  Factor 1 through 5 will be used to evaluate firm?s SF-330s during Phase 1.  Factor 1, 2 and 3 are considered critical and are of equal value; Factor 4 and 5 are less important than Factor 1, 2 and 3, and are listed in descending order of importance.  Subfactors are of equal importance.  In addition to Factor 1 through 5, Factor 6 will be used to evaluate the firm?s Phase 2 submission (PMP, TWP, and QMP) during Phase 2.  Factor 6 is less important than factor 1, 2 and 3 and more important than Factor 4 and 5.  Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate. 

FACTOR 1. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES:

The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in management, quality assurance planning and quality control reviews in similar projects; capability for quality oversight and assurance for work performed by other contractors and federal, state, and local entities; capability and general approach to developing a quality assurance and surveillance plan that reflects the performance standards and incentives tied to the Statement of Objectives; and ability to build effective partnerships between various levels of government, the public and the private sector.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in Earned Value Management in managing cost, schedule, and performance.  

FACTOR 3.  PAST PERFORMANCE IN CONTRACTS WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL, QUALITY OF WORK, AND COMPLIANCE WITH PERFORMANCE SCHEDULES.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry will be evaluated in terms of project management, accuracy of costs estimates, cost control, quality control, completion of projects within budget, and compliance with performance schedules for contracts of a similar type, size and scope.  Therefore, the firm must provide a list of up to five contracts performed within the past five (5) years.  For each contract, the firm must provide points of contact (name, title, email address and current telephone numbers).

The narrative must include a discussion of that contract?s project management, accuracy of cost estimates, cost control, quality control, completion of projects within budget, and compliance with performance schedules.   If the firm is a Joint Venture, contracts performed by its individual members must be included.  In the case of a firm without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  The Government reserves the right to use information outside of the response in evaluating past performance.

FACTOR 4. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK IN THE REQUIRED TIME.  
The government will evaluate the firm's ability to perform multiple complex projects, in multiple states concurrently, while accomplishing the work within required time limits.  Firms must explain planned versus existing capacities and the availability of proposed team members (including subcontractors and consultants), for the specified contract period.  

FACTOR 5.  LOCATION IN THE GENERAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE PROJECT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s familiarity and experience working with the state and local government entities and other professional organizations within the specific region/package area. 
The Government will evaluate the firm?s ability to produce and obtain products compliant with all national, regional, state and local rules and regulations; and with all necessary certifications; as well as the ability to identify and assess multiple hazards and unique or specialized flood risk situations within the specific region/package area.  

FACTOR 6. PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN, TECHNICAL WORK PLAN, AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN. 
a)  PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN.  The Government will evaluate the firm?s comprehensive approach to the overall development, management and coordination of the contract in accordance with the SOO.

The quality assurance surveillance plan shall describe (1) Selected Service Performance Areas (SSPA) that the firm considers most relevant in meeting the SOO; (2) the performance requirements for each SSPA (unacceptable, marginal, satisfactory, excellent, outstanding); (3) recommended time, place and amount of the method of Government surveillance; and (4) (optional) applicable incentives/disincentives if performance requirements are not met, or are exceeded.  It is the government?s intent to negotiate and incorporate a QMP in any resultant contract awarded.

Selection Process:

The selection process shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, Subpart 36.6, Performance-Based Contracting, and the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-852). Clarifications may be requested at any time.  The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase: during which the SF330 will be evaluated against the selection factor 1-5 listed below to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

The letter notifying those firms selected for the short list will contain an appointment for one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in the Region?s offices and shall not take longer than two (2) hours.  In preparation for their due diligence session, firms should review the websites listed in the SOO. 

Phase 2: Selection Phase:  during which the short-listed firms will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations pursuant to FAR 36.602-3(c).

Each of the short-listed firms shall be given an opportunity for oral presentation, which shall be made by the firm?s key personnel/management team.  After reviewing the Phase 2 submission, a letter will be sent to each of the short listed firms scheduling a date for the firm?s oral presentation and containing a list of questions covering the Phase 2 submission.  Each firm is responsible for ensuring that any required presentation tools and personnel are available and working properly for their presentation.  During the oral presentation, the short-listed firms may be requested to provide further clarification concerning their submission.  After oral presentations, the firms will be evaluated and ranked, based on the information presented in their Phase II submission and Oral presentation. 

Selection factor 1-6 listed below will be used for making the final selection(s).  

Unsuccessful firms and firms selected for negotiation of a contract will be notified.

Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection and will proceed until sufficient awards have been made.

Selection Factor:
Six (6) factor will be used in the selection of firms.  Factor 1 through 5 will be used to evaluate firm?s SF-330s during Phase 1.  Factor 1, 2 and 3 are considered critical and are of equal value; Factor 4 and 5 are less important than Factor 1, 2 and 3, and are listed in descending order of importance.  Subfactors are of equal importance.  In addition to Factor 1 through 5, Factor 6 will be used to evaluate the firm?s Phase 2 submission (PMP, TWP, and QMP) during Phase 2.  Factor 6 is less important than factor 1, 2 and 3 and more important than Factor 4 and 5.  Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate.

The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in management, quality assurance planning and quality control reviews in similar projects; capability for quality oversight and assurance for work performed by other contractors and federal, state, and local entities; capability and general approach to developing a quality assurance and surveillance plan that reflects the performance standards and incentives tied to the Statement of Objectives; and ability to build effective partnerships between various levels of government, the public and the private sector.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in Earned Value Management in managing cost, schedule, and performance.  

FACTOR 3.  PAST PERFORMANCE IN CONTRACTS WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL, QUALITY OF WORK, AND COMPLIANCE WITH PERFORMANCE SCHEDULES.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 6.302-1) 1.  Identification of the Agencies: Requesting Activity:		Veterans Health Administration 				National Center for Ethics in Health Care 					810 Vermont St, NW 					Washington, DC  20420 Contracting Activity:  		Department of Veterans Affairs 					Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC) 					National Enterprise Contracts (200/00D3)       					1615 Woodward Street 					Austin, TX 78772 2.  Description of Action:  This is a Sole Source Justification in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) to pursue an award of a firm fixed price contract, through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), without competition, for information technology (IT) services. Specifically, the proposed acquisition is being pursued as a non-competitive, firm fixed price contract for a base period of 12-months, with nine (9), 12-month options, in order to satisfy the strategic IT needs on behalf of the National Center for Ethics in Health Care.  The proposed contractor for this action is: DIALOG MEDICAL 	3075 Breckinridge Blvd, Suite 475  		Duluth, GA  30096-4981 3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The proposed contract will encompass the following: &quot;	Renew Subscription to Content Library for the iMedConsent library of clinical materials in English and Spanish iMedConsentT contains procedure-specific informed consent information (risks, benefits, alternatives, etc.) for all treatments and procedures performed in VA facilities that require signature consent. It also contains an extensive index of patient education documents, forms (including Advance Directives), drug information, and a wide selection of anatomical pictures and diagrams. These materials greatly improve the ability of VHA staff members involved in patient education to access and distribute consistent and thorough information to patients.  All materials, except the drug monographs and anatomical images are provided in Spanish as well as in English.  Dialog Medical regularly adds to and updates its Content Library.  A summary of the new, deleted or revised consent documents is provided to the appropriate VA Field Advisory Committee (FAC). &quot;	Renew Software Maintenance for the iMedConsent program as modified for VA use Development &quot;	Provide regular application updates and releases that include corrections to reported defects, new program functionality and associated services.  &quot;	Address VA requested program changes through regular program updates.  &quot;	Maintain rigorous Quality Assurance effort, including Alpha testing on VA-specific system configurations and Beta testing at selected VA locations prior to general release.  &quot;	Provide technical and end-user documentation for each program release.  &quot;	Consult with technical representatives of other VA software vendors to assure interface operability.  Support - Provide customer service to the VA (158 VA facilities and the VA Central Office). The main goal of Dialog Medical VA support is to answer inquiries and to resolve identified iMedConsent incidents in support of the Electronic Support for Patient Decisions Initiative across all VA facilities. Dialog Medical customer support addresses VA customer issues by: &quot;         Clearly identifying questions/problems and recording them &quot;         Classification of the question/problem &quot;         Question/problem investigation and diagnosis  &quot;         Resolution follow up. &quot;	Software Enhancements for the iMedConsent program to include:   &quot;Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) User Context Sharing Enhancement - CCOW is designed to communicate the name (information) of the active user between various programs on the same machine. The user should only need to log into one application, and the other applications running on the machine will &quot;know&quot; who is logged in. The VA uses a product from a company, Sentillion, called Vergeance Locator to allow the sharing of patient information from Vista (electronic medical record system) across applications. This is also used with the interface from Vista to iMedConsent. Though patient information sharing is occurring, the user still is required to log into Vista again when launching iMedConsent. The proposal in the enhancement will update the interface to prevent that additional login.  &quot;Inclusion of VA Form 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR - Application for Medical Benefits (Enroll) and Updates;  &quot;Pharmacy-Signature Receipt of Drugs - iMedConsent to be used for patient signature receipt of drugs in the pharmacy. In particular, a barcode scanner scans the Rx number off the label of a drug prescription. The scanner acts like an input device for the computer and translates the bar code into a number. The number would be sent via interface to Vista\CPRS to extract the generic name of the drug, last fill number, patient information, etc. That information is used to populate a patient and prescription-specific form. Upon agreement, the patient signs the form in iMedConsent that the prescription refill has been received, and the digital copy of the signed form is stored in the patient's electronic medical record. The estimated value of the new 10-year action is approximately $40,000,000, including future enhancements.  This estimated value is based on the projected requirements, as well as, the historical data of the work that has been accomplished thus far. 4.  Authority:  This acquisition will be conducted under the primary statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     5.  Reason for Acquiring the Services Without Competition:   The previous requirement was awarded in FY04 utilizing competitive procedures under the VA Procurement Contract for Hardware and Software (PCHS2), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) vehicle.  MPC was the contractor selected for award based upon the fact that their response offered the best value to the Government.  MPC's subcontractor and the manufacturer of the software is Dialog Medical.  Since award, MPC/Dialog Medical has acquired a unique combination of personnel with the proper blend of technical expertise and historical perspective of this program.  MPC/Dialog Medical has established themselves as a responsible firm and has performed exceptionally well in supporting the Government's requirements.   VHA Handbook 1004.1 outlines specific requirements for the informed consent process.  A recent review in one VAMC found that the vast majority of informed consent forms failed to include data elements, such as the date and time the discussion took place, the names of the practitioners involved, an assessment of the patient's decision-making capacity, and the signature of a witness.   In 2001 and 2002, individual facilities and several national program offices began exploring and/or promoting the use of computer technology to improve the process and documentation of informed consent.  However, in March of 2003, the Health Systems Committee directed the National Center for Ethics in Health Care (Ethics Center) to work with other VHA national program offices and field-based experts to provide market research and thoroughly evaluate the desirability of national implementation of a computerized informed consent software product.  A product called iMedConsent, by Dialog Medical, already available to VA through MPC and the PCHS2 contract, was determined most appropriate for VHA.  However, a number of quality and safety concerns were identified that needed to be addressed.  In July 2003, the Deputy Under Secretary for Health, Operations &amp; Management (DUSH O&amp;M) imposed a national moratorium on further purchase and implementation iMedConsent, pending resolution of these concerns and consideration of a possible national purchase of, a modified version of, iMedConsent.  At that time, seven (7) VA facilities were already actively using iMedConsent and eight (8) more facilities had purchased, but not yet implemented the program.  An additional 28 individual facilities and five (5) VISN offices were actively considering its purchase.  The Health Systems Committee and the Informatics and Data Management Committee (IDMC) approved the Ethics Center's 6-month plan to work with other program offices and field advisory groups to make extensive modifications to the iMedConsent software to meet VHA-specific needs, and pilot test the modified product. In FY04, the VA purchased a perpetual license for the iMedConsent software product through the PCHS2 contract, with MPC as the prime contractor (Dialog Medical, subcontractor).  The value of this order was $6,732,840, which included the license, development work of the software product to meet VHA specific needs, yearly software maintenance and implementation services at 162 hospitals, with a 16-month period of performance ending August 31, 2005 The VA currently uses the iMedConsent software program under a perpetual software license purchased in 2004. The iMedConsent software program is a forms management application integrated with VA's VistA platform. It allows for the processing of documents, signature capture, storage of signed documents, and communication with VA's VistA system. The VA receives bug fixes, enhancements and support services for the iMedConsent software program through a maintenance agreement.   The VA also subscribes to Dialog Medical's Content Library.   The content library contains thousands of procedure-specific consent forms, education materials and other documents useful for the informed consent process.  These documents are used by the iMedConsent software program.  Alternatively, the VA could choose to author and keep current its own content library for use with the iMedConsent software program.  The VA considered this alternative and decided against it, opting instead to subscribe to Dialog Medical's content library.  The subscription is annual. MPC modified the commercial off the shelf (COTS) software to work with VA systems.  The VA version of iMedConsent has been modified to interface with VHA's computerized records system.  The program enables practitioners to access a large library of documents, including drug information, patient instructions and anatomical diagrams and VA-specific documents such as VA Form 10-0137, VA Advance Directive.  For treatments and procedures requiring signature consent, the program walks the practitioner through the various steps required by VA policy; provides help screens, reminders and policy links to encourage best practices; generates a customizable and patient-friendly electronic consent form; automatically populates consent forms with information specific to the patient and the selected treatment or procedure (from the iMedConsent library); incorporates signatures from an electronic signature pad; stores the consent form in the patient record; automatically generates an accompanying progress note in CPRS; exports selected data into a secure file to be used for quality improvement.  Customization of the COTS software is not completed, however, once VA customization is complete, iMedConsent will include new wizards for advance care planning, HIV counseling and consent, and assessment of decision-making capacity. In FY05, the VA renewed the order with MPC through the PCHS2 contract in the amount of $3,166,792.  This order included a yearly subscription, software maintenance and the development of the Spanish Content enhancement, with a 12-month period of performance ending on August 31, 2006. In-depth evaluation and pilot testing of the revised iMedConsent product provides compelling evidence that it satisfies VHA requirements on the following dimensions:  technical; patient safety; acceptance by patients and practitioners; accuracy of clinical information; appropriateness of patient education materials; compliance with documentation requirements of VA policy; and unanimous endorsement by service chiefs and clinical application coordinators.   In FY06, the PCHS2 contract vehicle expired and the VA purchased directly from Dialog Medical, a small business, in the amount of $2,509,435.  This order included a renewal of the yearly subscription for English and Spanish content and software maintenance, with a 12-month period of performance ending August 31, 2007. Conducting an open market competition or pursuing any other competitive approach is not possible.  The small business contractor, Dialog Medical, owns the Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product with proprietary rights.  There are no other sources or resellers of the standard maintenance of the COTS license and the modified version of the VA customized program.  The software is proprietary to Dialog Medical and they are the only ones who own the source code. The incumbent contractor, Dialog Medical, has demonstrated their ability to provide an acceptable level of technical support of the critical functions.   No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience that can assume the very specific sustainment activities without interruption.  Dialog Medical has the requisite number of key personnel possessing the required expertise for all the software applications needed for the day-to-day operations.  Any break in Dialog Medical's support will result in systems failure, hardware and software, work stoppage and substantial additional costs in the amount of $12,409,067.  Without this continued service in place, discontinuing this mandated initiative would cause significant clinical disruption and would compromise patient safety, given the degree of the software's implementation across the VA's health care system. 6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Based on the fact that the iMedConsent program is of a proprietary nature, there are no efforts to obtain competition.    7.  Best Value:  The Contracting Officer will negotiate a fair and reasonable price with Dialog Medical to receive the best value for their product.  8.  Market Survey:  For more than two (2) years, individual facilities and several national program offices explored the use of computer technology to improve the process and documentation of informed consent.  However, in March of 2003, the Health Systems Committee of VHA's National Leadership Board directed the National Center for Ethics in Health Care to work with other VHA national program offices and field-based experts to provide market research and thoroughly evaluate the desirability of national implementation of a computerized informed consent software product.  A product called iMedConsent, by Dialog Medical, available to VA through MPC and the PCHS2 contract, was determined most appropriate for VHA.  A presolicitation notice was issued on August 3, 2007, and no vendors have responded to date.  9.  Other Facts:  The original requirement was awarded competitively utilizing the PCHS2 contract vehicle.   The requested award builds on Dialog Medical's development work completed to date.     10.  Interested Sources:  The original requirement was awarded competitively utilizing the PCHS2 contract vehicle.  As previously discussed, a substantial duplicate investment of time and money would be required on the part of the Government and/or another contractor to get the Ethics Center's informed consent improvement initiative to its current position.  There are no other sources or resellers of the standard maintenance of the COTS license and the modified version of the VA customized program.  The software is proprietary to Dialog Medical and they are the only ones who own the source code.  In addition, discontinuing this mandated initiative would cause significant clinical disruption and would compromise patient safety, given the degree of the software's implementation across the VA's health care system. 11.  Steps to Increase Competition:  There are no actions that can be taken to make the current requirement available for competition, without incurring substantial duplicate costs and experiencing unacceptable delays.  In addition, FAR 17.207 requires the Contracting Officer to provide a written determination in order to justify that exercising the option is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's need for continuity of operations and potential costs of disruption of operations. 12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  The Contracting Officer's signature on the cover page certifies that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this Other than Full and Open Competition Justification and Approval, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. 13.  Technical Certification:  The Program Manager's signature on the cover page certifies that the supporting data under his cognizance, which are included in this Other than Full and Open Competition Justification and Approval, is accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.

The acquisition method is negotiated procurement.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff.  This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Gove rnment to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial  offers without discussions.

Evaluation factors may consists of the following: (1) Past Performance on projects similar in nature; (2) Specialized experience in constructing DoD facilities that serve as part of the world-wide satellite communications network, employing high reliability power and HVAC systems, foundations and utility interconnectivity with satellite communications antennas, and control & monitoring for restricted access to the complex ; (3) Key Personnel, including construction members;  (4) Project Management Plan that emphasizes communications with and responsiveness  to multiple users that will share the facility; ability to respond to user-installed equipment technology upgrades throughout the construction period, and aggressiveness in meeting or exceeding the construction period timelines, and (5) Small Business Uti lization Opportunities.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive. SITE VISIT:  A site visit is scheduled for September 13, 2007 at 10:00 AM local time.  Please contact Mr. Jack Janney at 805.734.4670 for additional information.

If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package .  The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contact.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Automated Scheduling Software

<CONTACT>Daniel Stupinski, Contracts Manager, Phone 310-416-1779, Fax 310-416-1746, Email daniel.stupinski@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information is issued by the Space C2/STTR Division, SYSW/SYAG/CJD, to solicit information from industry that will aid the SPO in assessing the availability of automated scheduling software that can provide a robust scheduling tool for the Space Test and Training Range (STTR).   Information obtained as a result of this posting may be used for a formal solicitation of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software that meets the requirements for scheduling test events with little or no modification.   Currently, range schedulers use a variety of non-automated computer tools (e.g., Microsoft Excel spread sheets) to track and display range events and maintenance activities.  This is a cumbersome and time-consuming method to make scheduling decisions and transmit the schedule to higher command levels.  To reduce cost, time and provide a more rigorous decision making capability, a new vision for scheduling that is modeled after other Air Force test ranges is being investigated for implementation.  The new vision calls for an automated software tool that provides a web-based interface between the STTR and its customers that allows the customer to see the established schedule and input an event request.   A second module, interactive with the web-based interface, will provide for assignment of resources (both hardware and personnel), automatically identify/assess schedule conflicts, and provide conflict solutions to the schedule administrator.  The schedule output will be displayed on a calendar for both web-based display, printing, and a standard software export (e.g., Microsoft Excel or Project) to higher headquarters.  
The following information is requested: 
1)       Describe currently existing products that could be made to function as an automated scheduler.   Indicate if your company would be prepared to demonstrate such products to the Government for evaluation.
2)       Describe the ability of the software to automatically perform conflict resolution and highlight the solution to the administrator for approval or rejection.
3)       Describe the hardware and any other software required for implementation at a central location.
4)       Discuss in general terms an approach to and requirement for licensing and long term support of the software.
5)       We also invite industry to comment on specialized features that have additional potential to enhance scheduling and the interface with customers and managers. 

Questions/concerns regarding this request for information should be sent via e-mail to the Contract Manager. This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.     No entitlement to payment of direct/indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this request for information and the Government's use of such information. Respondents to this request for information may be requested to provide additional information/details/demonstrations based on their initial submittals.  Responses to this request for information are to be submitted and addressed to the Contract Manager, at the email address below, no later than 20 Sep 2007.  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>SCIENCE MISSION PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. A.  Request Summary The NASA Science Mission Directorate requests information on potential partnering opportunities on space missions sponsored by other organizations and agencies, both U.S. and non-U.S., which might be used to advance NASA’s strategic goals in astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, and planetary science including lunar science. NASA is interested in partner Missions of Opportunity that expand flight rates for NASA-provided science instruments and advance Decadal Survey science priorities.  B.  Background The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is responsible for advancing the pace of discoveries in Earth and space science. A comprehensive program for doing so includes expanding partnerships that include the provision of NASA contributions to U.S. and non-U.S. missions sponsored by organizations other than NASA. SMD solicits partner Mission of Opportunity proposals with each of its Announcements of Opportunity (AOs) in order to identify collaborative opportunities and to consider specific partnership proposals. NASA uses competitive peer review of these proposals to inform its decisions on which partnership proposals to accept. NASA will be issuing the Small Explorer (SMEX) AO in late September 2007; the SMEX AO will solicit partnership proposals for collaborative investigations supporting NASA’s astrophysics and heliophysics research programs. SMD is also considering issuing a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting Mission of Opportunity proposals that is not tied to a specific AO. If SMD issues this Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity NRA (SALMON), it would be issued no earlier than Spring 2008. It is anticipated that SALMON proposal opportunities will be offered approximately annually, as SMD’s budget allows, taking advantage of partner opportunities that may arise from year to year. SALMON may solicit Mission of Opportunity proposals in any of SMD’s four science areas. However, because of the opportunity to submit Mission of Opportunity proposals in response to the SMEX AO in the science areas of astrophysics and heliophysics, it is likely that astrophysics and heliophysics proposals will not be solicited in the Spring 2008 SALMON solicitation. SMD requests information on potential partnering opportunities on space missions sponsored by other organizations and agencies, both U.S. and non-U.S., which might be used to advance NASA’s strategic goals in astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, and planetary science including lunar science. This information will be used by NASA to facilitate planning for the Spring 2008 release of SALMON as well as planning for the evaluation of partner Mission of Opportunity proposals that may be submitted in response to the SMEX AO. C.  Requested Information The response to this request for information (RFI) will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA’s NSPIRES system (see instructions below). The response should not exceed three pages in length. The response must contain the following information: • Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, email address); • SMD Division with which the partnering opportunity is best aligned (astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, or planetary/lunar science); and • Description of partnering opportunity including any information that might be useful to NASA in planning for partnerships with other agencies and SMD solicitations including SALMON. This information might include a description of the mission including mission objectives, the mission’s sponsor, the status of mission approval, potential deadlines for NASA considering and approving a contribution, potential NASA contributions including science objectives, general scope, cost, etc. NASA is soliciting information that might be used by NASA to facilitate planning for potential partnering opportunities. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. No proposals will be awarded funding as a result of this RFI. D.  Instructions All responses submitted in response to this RFI must be submitted in electronic form via NSPIRES, the NASA online announcement data management system, located at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Hurricane Center (NHC), located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of GOES-EAST Ingest System Software Support and GOES-WEST Ingest System Software Support on a sole source basis from Global Imaging, Solana Beach, CA, based on the following reasons:  1) NHC requires support for satellite ingest systems and processing software, Global Imaging is the only known source for this support; 2) Global Imaging is the only known source who manufactures the GOES-EAST and GOES-WEST  satellite ingest cards currently in operation at the NHC, and its proprietary GOES-EAST Ingest System Software and GOES-WEST Ingest System Software meets all the requirements needed by NHC; 3) Switching to another source would require the repurchasing of both hardware and software, which would not be most advantageous to the Government given the expense already put forth; 4) The only other known source for this service would be Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC).  However, for the NHC to switch to this other provider it would have to buy new hardware (estimated at $60K) and then pay for the software support on the SSEC systems.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or sent via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The Navstar GPS Block III Space Vehicle Program (GPS III) intends to award a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract modification to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems & Solutions contract FA8807-04-C-0001 for a period of 01 October 2007 to 31 January 2008.  Lockheed Martin can provide the following supplies without the Government incurring substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)).  GPS Constellation sustainment is driving the need for GPS IIIA Key Decision Point-B (KDP-B).  The delay of KDP-B from August to December 2007 provided an opportunity for further system design risk reduction activities to be performed.  Lockheed Martin is currently on contract and has completed a delta Systems Requirements Review (SRR) in November of 2006 and System Design Review (SDR) in March of 2007.  This action will add four months to the existing GPS III Phase A contract and will build upon Lockheed Martin?s current GPS III Space Vehicle Risk Reduction and System Definition effort scheduled to conclude September 2007.  

Under the contemplated contract action, Lockheed will provide demonstration of lower-level design maturity and analysis of critical technologies and engineering integration processes to ensure time-certain development.  Lockheed Martin will also provide key updates to the SDR baseline to ensure functional and performance allocations are complete and traceable from space system level to sub-system level.  This includes functional and performance requirements flowdown to incorporate evolving requirements as identified in the July 2007 Joint Requirements Oversight Council GPS III Capability Development Document.  Other key products include a mature space system design and navigation payload sub-system design consistent with the contractor's prime item specification and SMC military specifications and standards.  Furthermore, Lockheed Martin will provide necessary Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCE) updates consistent with a high confidence, low risk capability insertion program plan for a FY2014 launch availability and additional LCCE for an accelerated launch availability before FY2014; and mature contractor GPS definition and design products to support on-going Independent Program Assessment and Independent Cost Assessment for the December 2007 KDP-B.


Interested contractors are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing the ability to satisfy the above requirements to SMC/GPK, Attn: Capt Chad Pelekai, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  All responses are due no later than 19 September 2007 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12-point, with a maximum of 20 pages.  The SOC must include the following information:  1) company name, mailing address, points of contact, and telephone numbers; 2) business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) experience in GPS Satellites or similar space systems; 4) ability to satisfy the Government's performance requirements described above.  Oral communications are not acceptable.  All responsible sources may submit a SOC, which will be considered.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information or reimburse expenses incurred by parties for responses to this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administrations Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with The Catholic University of America, Office of Sponsored Programs, 620 Michigan Ave.,Washington, DC  20064.

Background:  NOAA/SEC physicists have been awarded a NASA LWS grant to develop new techniques for applying multi-view white-light observations of the solar corona to improve understanding and forecasting of Earthward-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

The sole source determination is based on NOAA/SEC requirement for instrumental calibrations, background corrections, and methodology needed to extract accurate polarization data for the NOAA/NASA/LWS Stereo White-Light Project.  Additionally, image data, corrected images and analytic expertise from the STEREO project for SEC research are required as well as expertise on polarization issues.  The project utilizes adaptations of two different techniques.  One is the geometric localization technique developed at SEC, based on simple triangulation of points along the periphery of the CME as seen from the two views provided by the twin STEREO spacecraft.  The other is the polarization analysis technique.  Period of performance is 1 year with an option to extend for 1 more year, contingent upon acceptable performance, and the availability of funds.  Reports are required for each performance period.  The work is to be conducted at the recipient?s home institution, making use of its equipment and resources.

The Catholic University of America is the only vendor that can meet the NOAA/SEC requirement for the instrumental calibrations, background corrections, and methodology needed to extract accurate polarization data for the project because the polarization technique was developed by Dr. Moran at The Catholic University, and Dr. Davila at NASA/GSFC.  Additionally, Dr. Moran?s expertise as a consultant for polarization issues is vital to combining successfully the results of polarization and geometric localization techniques in the new area of multi-view coronal analysis.  Further, Dr. Moran, in collaboration with Dr. Davila, pioneered use of Polaroid imagery of CMEs using single-view SOHO/LASCO coronagraph data.  In a landmark paper in Science (305, 66, 2004), they demonstrated for the first time that meticulously corrected polarization data could be used to obtain an impression of the three-dimensional structure of CMEs, a feat long hoped for by coronal physicists but never actually achieved.  Dr. Moran?s work on the instrumental corrections was a key element in unlocking the power of polarization information for this application.  In addition, his close collaboration with Dr. Davila, project scientist for the STEREO mission, his experience with handling real SOHO/LASCO data, and his familiarity with the STEREO instrumentation make him a unique fit to provide the corrected images and analytic expertise needed for the SEC project.  The image data for the project will be provided by the NASA STEREO mission, which should begin producing binocular views of the corona in mid-summer of 2006.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide services and data that fully meet the Government?s requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government, not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS/S&T) is interested in identifying potential vendors with prototype Shoe Screener systems for Government- conducted laboratory assessment.  TSA is interested in establishing a Qualified Products Listing (QPL) as a method to regulate equipment used in Registered Traveler (RT) services provided by a commercial security provider to supplement and/or expedite passenger processing through airport checkpoints.  S&T is conducting market research in support of this TSA future need and anticipates releasing a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources for prototype systems that are sufficiently mature for laboratory assessment.  System maturity should be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or 7 defined as System/Subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.  In other words, the system should be suitable for field testing by a typical Transportation Security Operator (TSO) at a commercial airport.  The preliminary goals for a Shoe Screener have been coordinated with TSA/CTO and will be incorporated in a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) as part of the RFI to industry.  TSA and S&T are interested in a system capable of detecting a wide variety of military, commercial and home made explosives that may be concealed in commercially available shoes (or any type of foot-wear).  The system should be capable of detecting explosives, either concealed in shoes or traces of explosives on passenger shoes or legs to a height of 18 inches from the floor without the passenger having to remove their shoes.  The Government anticipates establishing a Bailment agreement with each industry participant prior to delivery of any prototype system for lab assessment.  A sample Bailment agreement will be included with the RFI.  Companies will be provided access to testing data but not the Government assessment of their system.  Testing data may be determined to be Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or may even be classified in accordance with appropriate Government Security Classification Guidance documents.  US citizenship is a prerequisite to receiving SSI.  Vendors that may be interested in responding to this RFI are requested to notify the S&T contracting officer, Ms. SusanKelly Haskett at

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Award - Report on fire and debris flow history on the Sawtooth National Recreation Area to Boise State University
<DESC>Notice of Intent - This requirement is for follow on to existing requirement with Boise State University, 1910 University Drive, Boise, Idaho 83725-1247 to furnish report on past records of fire and disturbance for the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Sawtooth National Forest. The objective of this research project is to reconstruct records of fire and disturbance within lodgepole pine-dominated forests of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA).  The proposed study is intended to provide preliminary data for natural resource managers, and to provide data for further work.  Disturbance histories in these forests will be developed using three methods:  1) establishing the ages of even-aged stands of trees through tree-coring and aerial photo mapping; 2) dating of past fires using charcoal from past fires preserved in alluvial fans; and 3) comparing fire data to a data set of insect infestation to gain an understanding of the interactions between fire and insect infestations in the Sawtooth region.  This proposed work will provide preliminary data on; 1) the history of stand-replacing disturbance for even-aged stands lodgepole pine forests in the Sawtooth National Forest, and 2) a pre-settlement record of fire-related sedimentation events in Fourth of July Creek and adjacent drainages derived from alluvial fan records.  The product of this work will be a preliminary stand age reconstruction and fire history reconstruction for lodgepole pine forests in the SNRA.  This data will help address the question of whether or not large fires such as the Valley Road fire are truly exceptional in the Sawtooth area, and will provide an indication of the return interval of stand-replacing disturbance.  This data will help inform management of fuel accumulations and inform planning for future disturbance in the forest.   This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  This determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1.  No offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a brand name contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires Cisco VOIP Software licenses.  Interested parties may e-mail  stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday, 7 September 2007; 12:00 p.m.. EST.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

Unity Unified Messaging software is developed and maintained by Cisco Systems.USSOCOM requires voicemail services to provide to  its enterprise clients.  The Cisco VoIP architecture is currently installed at HQ USSOCOM and 5 adjunct units supporting more then 2000 garrison and deployed devices in support of the Global War on Terrorism.  To purchase the required software from any source, other than Cisco, would require the use of additional resources for testing and approving compatibility with the current network architecture.  Market surveys show that it would cost over $500,000 to replace all  equipment, at all commands with VOIP systems of lessor quality. The data is supported by market research done at vtiphonesystems.com. Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 
L-3 Communications in Camden, N.J. is the sole manufacturer of the STE and therefore the only authorized vendor to repair the STE phones.  L-3 is the only source and manufacturer of parts for the STE?s.  No other company possesses or is authorized to posses, the unique encryption parts necessary to repair a STE.  According to the STE program manager at the National Security Agency (Ms. Marianne McGinty, DSN 244-7073), ?L-3 is the only source for necessary required/certified parts for the STE and only source of required test equipment.?  USSOCOM requires L-3 Communications support to keep our current STE?s operational and current to provide secure voice and data communications.  STE is the only device that can go secure with the STU-III and with all new FNBDT secure equipment.  ATTEMPTED USE OF A STE ENCRYPTION DEVICE AFTER AND UNAUTHORIZED REPAIR WILL CONSTITUTE A COMSEC SECURITY INCIDENT AND A POSSIBLE LOSS OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

<SUBJECT>A -- IMMUNE RESPONSE IN CHIMPANZEES FOLLOWING HEPATITIS C VIRUS T-CELL VACCINE
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the University of Louisiana at LaFayette - New Iberia Research Center .  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The Purchase Order will be made on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures and 13.501 (A)- Sole source acquisitions for the following, full time, services to be performed at University of Louisiana at LaFayette - New Iberia Research Center.  Statement of Work:
We have developed a chimpanzee model for HCV using a clonal virus that produces infections with highly reproducible viral kinetics. We have a large amount of immunologic, virologic, and pathologic data with this model and have developed a set of reagents specific for the study of infections with this HCV strain. 
3 naive chimpanzees will be immunized i/v with our DNA prime/recombinant adenovirus boost vaccine that induces T cell responses to NS3 and NS5 and challenged with 100 CID50 of the clonal HCV inoculum which matches the sequence used to generate the vaccine. The vaccination series requires 3 months, animals will be challenged 3 months after the last dose of vaccine and the follow-up will be a further 6 months (1 year total).
We will obtain weekly bleeds, alternating between 5ml of serum and 70mL of whole blood for T-cell isolation. We will also obtain liver biopsies every other week throughout the study. We will obtain 4 weeks of pre samples from all animals. The immune responses in the liver and the peripheral blood of all animals will be thoroughly studied using reagents that we have already developed or purchased. Liver biopsy samples will be obtained to isolate T-cells and for quantitative PCR determination of specific mRNA levels for immune response genes, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and 2OAS to study innate immunity. HCV-specific T-cells will be analyzed by 12-color flow cytometry for surface markers (CD4+, CD8+, CD62L, CD27, CCR7, CD127) and intracellular cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha) in order to determine the memory cell phenotype and perform qualitative comparisons between T-cells induced by vaccination versus those induced by natural infection. These analyses are currently being performed on chimpanzee T-cells from previous studies. Global micro array analyses or immune selected array panels will be performed on mRNA extracted from the liver biopsies.

Inoculations: 
0 and 4 weeks: 
DNA plasmids: ~4mg for each of 2 plasmids complexed with liposomes (8mg total) i/v. DNA concentration will be 2mg/ml in PBS. One plasmid expresses HCV antigens NS3-NS5B, the 2nd plasmid expresses human IL-12 as an adjuvant.
Week 12:  
3.1011 adenovirus particles, i.v. 1ml in PBS.
The recombinant adenovirus vectored vaccine is non-replicating and administered at a dose of 1011 particles for each of 3 different constructs i.v. Both these vaccines have been used in previous chimpanzee experiments without difficulty.
Week 24: 
100 CID50 of HCV genotype 1a in the 4 animals, i.v. 3ml in Hanks buffer.This virus has been given in this dose to over 10 chimpanzees with a 100% take rate. Persistent infections have developed in about 60% of the chimps. The liver disease has been very mild.
Blood withdrawal: 
10 ml from the femoral vein every other week for plasma. 70 ml whole from the femoral vein every other week for isolation of PBMCs. 

These volume of blood removed per month will be well within allowable limits for animals of the weight and size to be used in this study.
Procedures: Percutaneous liver biopsies at a maximum frequency of every 2 week by Klatskin. Menghini or Vimm-Silverman method according to protocols of NIRC.  A maximum of 12 biopsies will be performed. 
The experiment will last a maximum of 1 years unless stopped earlier by PI.  There may be an extension of up to 12 months depending on the availability of funding. 
Animals will be anesthetized for all bleedings and procedures. 
The University has worked extensively in these areas and thus possesses an understanding of the procedures, problems and timeliness aspect to these projects.  Having the same University continue to do this will ensure that critical work is not interrupted and is completed in a manner that furthers the mission of FDA.  The proposed source is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  This action is proposed on a sole source basis because it is a follow-on contract where the University has developed procedures that help expedite critical requests and there being a substantial duplication of cost to the government. Any Interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than September 10, 2007.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be sent via email to Kimberly.davis@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Scanning Confocal Microscope
<DESC>It is the intent of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Acquisitions & Grants Office, to negotiate on a sole source basis with Attocube Systems, AG, for award of a contract to provide one each, of a scanning confocal microscope (CFM).  The contract will provide a CFM that shall perform metrology or single semiconductor quantum dots, nanopatterened devices, and semiconductor waveguides.  Due to the nature of these measurements (small feature sizes, low temperature environment and small signal levels) the performance requirements for this system are extremely rigorous.  After conducting market research, the Government has found only one supplier (Attocube) that offers a low temperature measurement CFM that is designed to be inserted into a helium bath and is designed to reach 4.2 K and meet the stability specifications.  The Government?s salient characteristics are detailed below.

1.	The CFM shall be able to operate in a Helium bath with the sample temperature variable between 4.2 and 70 Kelvin.  In addition, the CFM shall be operable in magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla.
2.	The CFM shall be able to image a single quantum dot for a period of at least two days.  This requires stability greater than 50 nm over this two day period.
3.	The CFM shall be operable in both the transmission and reflection mode.
4.	Resolution shall be diffraction limited
5.	Excitation/Emission Wavelength: 950-1100 nm.
6.	The CFM shall be capable of taking 2D and 3D single scans as a function of time.  The system shall also include a suitable computer and user friendly software for interfacing with the microscope.  Included in this software shall be image-processing and 3D visualization tools.  Data collected from the microscope scans shall be stored in a suitable format for export to third party software.
7.	Sample positioners shall have a minimum step size of < 10 nm at 4K and a scan range of at least 30 x 30 square microns.  Course positioning range shall be > 3 x 3 square millimeters.

 The proposed contact action is for supplies for which the Government intends to negotiate and award with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide this equipment and meet the Government?s essential requirements may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All capabilities/qualifications must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the stated requirements.  Interested parties must address each of the mandatory requirements listed in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet requirements.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Bitterroot National Forest Trail Construction Prospectus
<DESC>The Bitterroot National Forest, Sula Ranger District, is advertising a Pre-Solicitation Prospectus for trail construction to establish trail tread in three separate locations along the Continenal Divide National Scenic Trail #9 at pack and saddle standards.  Relocation #1 is located adjacent to Gibbons Pass, within ten (10) miles of Chief Joseph Pass and US 43.  The project location runs north to where the new trail connects to an existing trail tread: Total of 8,998 linear feet.  Obliteration of existing trail tread is required at this site.  Relocations #2 and #3 are located west of Schultz Saddle, along Forest Road 725, in relatively close proximity to each other.  These two project sites lie in old cutting units and the goal is to establish trail tread and tie existing segments of trail tread together.  Access for Relocations #2 and #3 is very distant (estimate of 50 miles) from Relocation #1.  Moving any construction equipment via Forest road system between project sites is required as there is no option for ?roading? equipment along the existing trail tread.  Road conditions will not be guaranteed free of downed timber as the access road and trail project sites were burned in 2000.  Access may require clearing downed trees to reach work sites and is incidental.  Moderate sideslope, heavy beargrass, and rocky ridgetop location.  Elevation ranges from 6,500-7500 feet so access is limited prior to June 15.  Non-wilderness location, suitable for motorized trail construction equipment but limited to 60-inch track width.  No switchback construction.  Blasting not required.  A seasonal road restriction for a portion of the access route (October 15 and December 1) will restrict operating season to prior to October 15.  The major work items include:  911and 912, 11,650 linear feet; 912, leadoff ditch: 100 linear feet; 912, rolling dips: 100 each; 954, obliteration: 700 linear feet.  A Pre-Solicitation Site Visit is not scheduled; however, prospective bidders/quoters are encouraged to visit the project on their own prior to winter conditions closing the area.  For any questions on directions or maps, contact Nick Hazelbaker at (406) 821-1218.

<SUBJECT>59 -- HUBZone Sole Source Notice - Defense ID Scanner
<DESC>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever AFB, Colorado hereby gives notice of its intention to award a HubZone sole source purchase order to Mobilisa, Inc. for a Defense ID System.  In accordance with FAR 19.1306, and based on our market research and our Sources Sought Notice, we have determined that only one HubZone small business exists which is capable of meeting the government needs.  The Defense ID System from Mobilisa utilizes a mobile, ruggedized handheld ID scanner able quickly scan an ID card and query multiple databases to determine if a person is cleared for entry into a military installation, and can indicate if a person is wanted by civilian law enforcement authorities or is otherwise a potential threat to the security of the installation.  The system is capable of interface with a Defense ID system database that can pull information from sources of public records on the National, Regional, State and Local levels as well as government and law enforcement sources.  The ID scanners are also compatible with all types of Federal and State issued identification cards.  This system will enhance safety and security of DoD assets at Schriever AFB, CO.  This award will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION and no proposals or quotes will be accepted as a result of this notice. The reference number is F3R0A07220A001.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Technique for Detection and Directionality Determination of Electromagnetic Sources
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Technique for Detection and Directionality Determination 
of Electromagnetic Sources 

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to partner with LLNL to develop hardware and software related to the detection and directionality determination of electromagnetic (EM) signal sources. This new, potentially portable technology is intended to identify and locate low-frequency electromagnetic noise sources in order to take off-line or quickly isolate and repair the interfering electrical/electronic equipment operating in buildings, factories and large commercial facilities. The technology will also have application relating to locating general EM signal sources having frequencies falling within the operational bandwidth of the receiver.

Background: At present, sources of interfering electrical noise in a facility must be detected using a time-consuming trial-and-error approach. It is expensive because resolving such problems is often performed by independent electrical noise consultants contracted on a daily basis. Current techniques for detecting and determining the direction of EM signal sources generally involve the use of large and unwieldy directional antennas having diameters of many meters or the use of antenna arrays. In practice, the large size of a directional antenna renders impractical obtaining the source direction from  very low-frequency signals (hertz to kilohertz range) such as the electrical noise harmonics that commonly emanate from the power supplies of electronic systems. 

In addition, common antennas and receivers for detecting EM signals are usually designed only to capture the electric-field component of the signal. Since electromagnetic waves are characterized by both electric and magnetic field potentially significant information is lost.

Description:   The LLNL approach uses both the electric and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave, which provides information about the direction of wave emanation as well as the flux of energy in the wave. 

Advantages:  
?X	Directionality can be readily determined
?X	Potentially highly portable
?X	Diagnostic tool rather than trial and error method
?X	Locate lower frequency (e.g., power-line frequency and associated harmonics) electrical interference noise sources in complex electrical/electronic environments. 
?X	Locate non-noise sources that have frequency components falling within the operational bandwidth of the receiver. 


Potential Applications: 
Electrical noise detection and elimination as well as non-noise signal location has commercial, law enforcement and military applications.
Specifically, the features and corresponding benefits to the applications are listed below. 

FEATURES                                    
1)Measure both the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave

2)Separate and identify different frequency sources through signal analysis 

3)Antennas are omni-directional

4) Directionality obtained entirely through analysis of acquired signal and not by a hands-on re-orienting of antenna during signal acquisition

BENEFITS
1) Antenna size comparable to wavelength of signal being acquired is not required. Makes possible low frequency noise directionality applications and portability

2) Directions of slightly different signals that even overlap in frequency can be isolated from each other.

3) All signals in a given frequency range are captured. 
   Intermittent noise or signals of interest will not be missed as for directional antennas pointed in the wrong direction.
   Moving sources can be tracked without re-orienting receiver.

4) Signal direction can be obtained either in real time or by postprocessing of saved digital signal data. 
   Data can be acquired passively and in remote environments without human involvement.

Development Status: 
	Initial field testing has identified noise signals from a power generator and load. providing directional information about the noise source. These tests have made apparent the advantages of measuring both the electric and magnetic fields of a signal. Further development is needed to scale down the electric- and magnetic-field antennas, the receiver and the processing hardware to a convenient level of portability (e.g., handheld). 

The analysis technique has been developed through subsequent detailed computer simulations of noise and signal sources, but is still in development and can benefit from signal processing and optimization development.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDA’s mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agency’s mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet – a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDA’s program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agency’s requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the program’s mission.<BR><BR>

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (National Crane)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. Procuring a brand name other than National Crane will require recertification and training course (see attached memo) of operators in 341 MOS. Consequently, the Government will not be able to meet 564th deactivation deadlines. 


DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of National Crane is in the best interest of the Government.

Professional Services to provide consulting services, guidance and advice to FDA/CVM in the areas of employee relations, conflict resolution, mediation, grievance examining, and personnel misconduct investigation.

       
Background 

The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. These include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or companion) animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. (Minor animal species include animals other than cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and cats.) 

Within CVM, the Office of Management is responsible for disseminating policies and procedures pertaining to staffing and employment.  These policies and procedures need to comply with and reinforce Federal, Departmental, and Agency regulations. While these regulations are often uniform and compatible, there are instances whereby the Agency, in order to more effectively support its mission and corporate values, has further defined a regulation more specifically to FDA requirements.  An example would be specific workplace policies described in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between FDA and the National Treasury Employees Union, such as the "Any 80" Alternate Work Schedule that is the standard for CVM.  As a result, these distinctive definitions have instigated the need for an expert in FDA employee relations matters. 

The consultant for this work must have expert knowledge in the areas of Employee Relations and the nuances related to the FDA. 

1.2	Objective

1.2.1	The purpose of this procurement is to augment CVM employee relations capabilities by having a contractor (with expert knowledge as outlined above) advise on and/or deliver employee relations products and services.

In addition the contractor should have a thorough familiarity with FDA's Collective Bargaining Agreement, the FDA Employee Assistance Program, FDA's Flexible Workplace Arrangement Program, the FDA Alternative Work Schedule Master Plan, and the various Staff Manual Guides, or SMGs,  that specifically interpret the Agency?s Personnel polices and procedures. An example of such an SMG would be 3031.2, "Procedures for Requiring Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities". The contractor will provide services and must possess expertise in employee relations, misconduct investigations, grievance examining and mediation to expeditiously accomplish the following objectives:

a.	provide counsel, advice, recommendations, and direction in all aspects of employee relations and personnel actions for CVM personnel. Personnel actions include but are not limited to detail, transfer, reassignment, and performance evaluations.

a.	Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) Between Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and the National Treasury Employees Union:  The CBA is an integral part of FDA culture and worklife.

Interpreting the CBA;
Implementing the provisions of the CBA; and
Working on employee relation cases that arose from the provisions of the various articles in the CBA, such as Performance Management Program, Flexible Work Place Program, Actions Based on Unacceptable Performance, Grievance Procedures, and Merit Promotion.

However, FDA also has the authority to utilize the Title 42 authority, an excepted service appointment authority, which entails a totally different set of personnel rules.  This is to be evidenced by specific narrative examples describing the issue, advice/consultation provided, and resulting outcome in order to describe experience in the following:
Interpreting the Title 42 policies under FDA and HHS such as the Senior Biomedical Research Service (Title 42, Section 228), Staff Fellow and Visiting Scientists (Title 42, 209(g)), and Senior Scientific Experts (Title 42, 209(f));

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Sub Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation number F3H2B17172AG04 is issued as a request for quotations.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.  The NAICS Code is 333999 and the NAICS size standard is 500. 55 CONS intends to issue a firm fixed priced purchase order for delivery of the following items on the Statement of Need:

STATEMENT OF NEED 
BLASTING ROOM RECLAIM FLOOR
SPECIFICATIONS

1 PNEUMATIC RECOVERY SYSTEM:  The recovery system consists of 'M' shaped recovery channels called M-Sections?, which are connected to a collection duct, called a transition unit.  Spent media is conveyed through this system by high velocity air flow.  The entire M-Section? floor area is covered by steel grating.

1.1 RECOVERY AREA:  There are two (2) each one (1) foot wide by ten (10) feet long recovery ducts covering a total of twenty (20) square feet.

1.2 FLOOR RECOVERY DUCTS:  The floor recovery ducts ('M'-Sections?) are of 16 ga. & 12 ga. hot-rolled steel construction.  Media falls through the grating into the recovery channels, and is moved pneumatically to the transition duct.

1.3 TRANSITION UNIT:  A pneumatic conveying transition duct runs perpendicular to, and at the end of the M-Section? recovery ducts. It is connected to each of the recovery ducts, and is designed to allow a predetermined number of recovery ducts to convey media at one time.  Periodically, other portions of the ducts are opened (timer controlled), thus some portion of the conveying ducts in the floor are open at all times.  The housing is fabricated from 12 ga. hot-rolled steel.

1.4 GRATING:  The entire media recovery area ("M"-Sections?) is covered with steel grating, designed for 2,000lb/ft2 uniform load capacity. This grating is supplied in easily removable sections.  

2 RECLAIM SEPARATION SYSTEM:  The media reclaim separation system is an air centrifuge, highly balanced separator, which receives all media and debris conveyed from the blasted work piece through a vacuum conveying duct.

2.1 RECLAIM CYCLONE:  The cyclone action of the reclaim centrifugally separates the blast media from the conveying air stream and collects oversized debris in the filter screen and deposits reusable media into the storage hopper section.  The dust and broken media is pulled through the center vortex tube along with air to the dust collection system.  The centrifugal force causes the oversized debris and reusable media to spin closely to the outside wall of the reclaim, away from the vortex tube. The dust and broken media remain closer to the vortex tube because of the light weight.  The material and air inside the reclaim has decreased in velocity because of the larger area of the reclaim itself.  In the vortex tube, the velocity is increased which allows for the dust and broken media that is closer to the vortex tube to be pulled into the tube and exhausted to the dust collection system.

2.1.1 NOMINAL CAPACITY:  1200 CFM.

2.1.2 SIZE:  27? inside diameter

2.1.3 CONSTRUCTION:  The media reclaim is fabricated from a minimum of 12 ga. hot rolled steel.

2.1.4 RECLAIM MOTOR:  The media reclaim is powered by a 5 Hp heavy-duty exhauster mounted on the clean air side of the dust collector.

2.1.5 STANDARD FEATURES:  A gasketed air-tight access door is provided on the side of the reclaim for easy removal of the filter screen basket and for refilling of the media charge.  The filter basket is provided to trap oversize debris.  A rubber lined wear plate is provided in the inlet of the reclaim for added abrasive protection.

2.1.6 EFFICIENCY:  Reclaim efficiency is determined by the amount of media of the original size remaining in the reclaim with a minimum of original size media in the dust collection system after a prolonged use. At any time during operation of the properly sized and adjusted reclaim, approximately 80% of original sized media by weight will be retained.

At the same time, approximately 20% of the original sized media, by weight, can be in the dust collector system.  The efficiency can be increased or decreased by how closely the reclaim system is adjusted and monitored for the type of media being used.  

2.1.7 ADJUSTMENTS:  Minor adjustment in the reclaim system can be made by adjusting static pressure which adjusts the air flow through the system. Major adjustments are made by an externally adjustable pipe inside the vortex tube, which is standard on all the pull through dust collection systems. 

2.1.8 LINING:  The entire top section of the reclaim assembly is fully rubber lined for protection against excessive wear from harsh abrasives.

2.1.9 STORAGE HOPPER: One (1) each six cubic foot (6 ft3) capacity hopper is provided

2.2 RECLAIM SYSTEM DUST COLLECTION EQUIPMENT:  It is a cartridge type, reverse pulse style, and is able to withstand temperatures from -20 degrees C to 97 degrees C. It is designed and built for continuous duty operation, and is of heavy duty construction.

2.2.1 CFM:  1200

2.2.2 SIZE:  Approx. 54" L x 36" W x 115" H.

2.2.3 ASSEMBLY:  The collector is partially preassembled at the factory and will be shipped in sections. Lifting points are provided for handling and set up.  

2.2.4 CONSTRUCTION:  Standard construction of the unit is 12 ga. hot rolled steel, reinforced to maintain structural integrity to 25" w. g. All wiring, air piping, solenoid, and diaphragm valves are mounted externally.  Inlet and outlet size is 11.5" x 11.5", and they are flanged for ease of ducting connection.

2.2.5 CARTRIDGES:  Cartridge cleaning is "on line" by reverse pulse flow of air.  The three (3) cartridges are 12 3/4" dia. x 36" long and are constructed of cellulose/polyester filter media, with suspension.  Pressure limit is 15 inches Hg. vacuum.  Maximum airflow per cartridge is 500 CFM.  The filter/media area is 235 ft2 per cartridge.  Cartridge permeability allows an approximate maximum of 2.12 CFM of air to pass through one square foot of filter material with an initial pressure differential of 0.53? w.g. Filter media efficiency is 99.7% for .5 micron size particles.

2.2.6 DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE GAUGE:  A differential pressure gauge is supplied to monitor the pressure between the dirty and clean side of the filters.  This gauge helps determine the proper setting for the timer "Off" time.

2.2.7 ADJUSTABLE TIMER:  An adjustable timer for controlling the "On" and "Off" time of the air pulse is enclosed in a NEMA-4 control panel. "On" time does not have to be adjusted.  The "Off" time controls the length of time between each pulse cycle.

2.2.8 ACCESS DOORS:  Access doors and removable panels are provided for ease of filter service and maintenance.

2.2.9 DUST DRUM: One (1) 30 gallon drum is provided.

2.2.10 EXHAUSTER:  5 Hp, with outlet damper.

2.2.11 DUCTING:  Twenty feet (20?-0?) of ?spiral? type ducting is supplied between the reclaim cyclone outlet and the dust collector inlet


2.2.12 H.E.P.A. FINAL FILTER:  The outlet side of the exhaust fan is fitted with a final filter unit, designed to capture fine particle emissions.  The unit is rated as H.E.P.A. grade which is 99.97% effective for 0.3 micron sized particles.

3 PRESSURE BLAST MACHINE:  The pressure blast equipment is specifically designed for use with most abrasive media, and incorporates all features necessary for efficient performance.  

3.1 PRESSURE VESSEL:  The media is fed into the compressed air stream from a six (6) ft3 capacity pressure vessel.  This pressure vessel is 24" (610 mm) diameter, and cylindrical in shape.  It conforms to all appropriate ASME regulations and carries a National Board approval certificate, with a rating of 150 psig.  The vessel has a conical bottom with a slope of 60 degrees.  The top of the vessel is concave to allow automatic feeding of the media through the remote controlled closure that is located in the center of the concave head.  This closure utilizes a rubber-to-rubber seal (commonly known as a "pop-up-valve") when closed.  A flat steel "umbrella" is mounted over this filling valve to allow valve closure against a full head of media.  During fabrication, the pressure vessels are abrasive blasted to remove any mill scale. A 6" x 8" (150 mm x 200 mm) hand hole is provided for maintenance access.  The pressure vessel is supplied with legs for stationary mounting on the equipment floor.  All air piping on the blast machine is 1-1/4" (32 mm) I.D. 

3.2 MEDIA FLOW VALVE:  This valve is a designed so that the manually adjustable metering function and the pneumatically operated valve actuation function are accomplished separately, allowing for quick and inexpensive replacement of wear items. The valve is mounted at 45 degrees to the compressed air piping and includes a "clean-out" access plate above the flow control area.

3.2.1 VALVE OPERATION:  When the valve is opened by the remote control handle, the plunger is completely withdrawn from the abrasive flow.  When the remote control handle is released, a spring closes the valve actuator, instantly stopping the abrasive flow.  The control of the media feed is through gravity only when the pressure in the vessel is equal to the pressure in the compressed air piping.   

The metering section of the valve incorporates a hardened steel metering plate for long life.  The metering valve allows fine adjustment from no-flow to fully open no matter what abrasive is used.

3.3 ABRASIVE CUT-OFF SWITCH:  A pneumatic cut-off switch is provided to allow the use of compressed air from the blast nozzle for dust blow down on blasted surfaces.  This switch controls the opening and closing of the grit valve from the remote control handle.  When abrasive blasting is completed, the operator simply flips the switch to the off position, halting the flow of abrasive. The air valve remains open so that only high velocity compressed air flows from the nozzle.  Releasing the RLX handle shuts down the entire unit.

3.4 BLAST HOSE:  The blast hose, which conveys the compressed air and media to the blast nozzle, has an inside diameter of 1-1/4" and an outside diameter of 1-7/8".  It weighs 39 pounds per each 50'-0" length. This hose is gun rubber lined and wrapped with a dual layer of tough nylon. The hose is rated at a working pressure of 175 psig.  The hose lining is 3/16" thick, carbon-black impregnated rubber for static dissipation.  It is fitted with lightweight, nylon quick couplings that mount externally, and incorporate automatically interlocking safety wires.  

3.5 BLAST NOZZLE:  One 3/8? ID tungsten carbide, rubber jacketed nozzle, will be provided with the blast machine.  Nozzles are manufactured of the highest quality materials, and designed for long life.  Connection of the nozzle to the blast hose is accomplished with an externally mounted nozzle holder made of nylon. In addition to the standard nozzle listed above the following nozzles will be supplied with the facility.

3.6 OPERATOR REMOTE CONTROLS:  The remote controls are of the pneumatic type, which incorporate a normally closed inlet valve and normally open outlet valve.  Air pressure opens the inlet valve and closes the outlet valve to begin the blasting process. If there is a loss of air pressure to the valves, springs return the valves to their normal position.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Automated Solar Tracker.***

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Automated Solar Tracker, which shall meet or exceed the following salient characteristics:

1.	The requested solar tracker system shall be capable of simultaneously mounting at least 2 Eppley Normal Incidence Pyrheliometers (NIP), one Eppley 8-48 Black and White Pyranometer (BW 8-48), and one Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP).  All of the noted radiation instruments shall be supplied by NIST.
2.	Using only new manufacturer supplied components (i.e. no used or refurbished components), the system shall be capable of continually tracking the sun over the daylight period when deployed in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The system shall be capable of orienting the NIST supplied NIPs (see specification number 5 for more details) so that they are in direct alignment with the sun and the BW 8-48 and PSP are positioned to lie within a small shaded location (see specification number 6 for more details).  Any equipment components, hardware or software, provided by a third party source to the manufacturer of the requested automated solar tracker shall be supported by the third party supplier.
3.	The system shall be designed to operate unattended day after day and go for a minimum of a month at a time without having to be adjusted.  This required minimum interval of autonomous operation over which the full list of specification are adhered (see especially specifications 5 to 7) shall be achieved without necessitating any user interaction, including clock adjustments of any kind.  Any type of alignment autocorrection capability is encouraged in meeting this specification.
4.	The system shall be designed to operate at least a year before requiring any type of maintenance service that would cause the loss of operation for more than 1 hour.
5.	The solar tracker system shall be capable of tracking the sun over the daylight period of all days of the year to within plus or minus 0.25 degrees.
6.	The system shall be capable of operating in outdoor conditions where the dry bulb temperature can range from minus 20 degrees C to plus 40 degrees C and the relative humidity can range from 10 to 100 percent. The system shall be able to tolerate exposure to snow, heavy rains, wind speeds less than 25 m/s, and smaller-size (20 mm maximum diameter) hail.
7.	During the entire daylight interval, the tracker system shall be capable of continually shading the BW 8-48 and PSP described in specification number 1 using a small disk or ball.  The size of the shading element shall prevent direct/beam radiation from impinging on the instruments? sensing device while otherwise maximizing the exposure of the same sensing device to the diffuse solar radiation. 
8.	The solar tracker systems shall interface with a PC running Windows XP as its operating system.  The manufacturer shall provide software which shall be used to set-up, monitor, and, when needed, debug the operation of the solar tracker.  NIST shall provide the computer. The PC interface shall be a standard product offering, and if an offeror has a version or model that otherwise meets specifications 1 to 12, it must offer equal to or better functionality.  The system shall also provide the flexibility to work with multiple Pentium-grade computers without requiring special measures (i.e., computer and tracker being serviced by the manufacturer) to allow interchangeability of computers. 
9.	The solar tracker system shall be designed for deployment on a low sloped commercial roof that has some minimum penetrations that may cause shading.  The system, therefore, shall be designed to always have the lowest NIST supplied solar radiation instrument (see specification number 1) at a height of 0.5 meters or higher above the crushed stone surface of the roof.
10.	System shall be designed to operate using electrical power supplied from a 115 VAC (60 Hz) source.
11.	Manufacturer shall warranty operation of the solar tracker system for a minimum of 2 years.
12.	Manufacturer shall supply all materials/components needed for conducting any normal maintenance on the solar tracker system during its first two years of deployment.
            

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance & price shall be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance shall be of equal importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.  

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets salient characteristics stated above and meets the needs of the Government in essentially the same manner as the brand name.

The following technical evaluation criteria, listed below in decreasing level of importance, shall be used in evaluating proposals received in response to this solicitation:

1.	Meeting/exceeding NIST requirements:  Reviewers will consider the offerors recommended product for its ability to meet all of the NIST specifications listed in this solicitation;

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a requirement for Tableau supplies. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this requirement; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  No solicitation document exists and requests for same will be considered non-responsive.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ) and the solicitation number is TIRNO-07-Q-00135. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18. 

The IRS has a need for the following items:   

CLIN 0001- Tableau T3U FireWire to SATA Write Protection Kits, Part Number T3u Kit, Quantity 130

CLIN 0002 - Tableau T8 Forensic USB Bridge Kits, Part Number T8 Kit, Quantity 120

CLIN 0003 - Tableau T5 Forensic IDE Bridge (Read Only), Part Number T5 Kit, Quantity 120.

The T3u Kit includes one (1) Tableau T3u FireWire800 Bridge, one (1) 8" SATA Data Cable, one (1) P9 to P9 FireWire Cable, two (2) P9 to P6 Adapters, one (1) P9 to P4 Adapter one (1) 4-pin Molex to SATA Power Cable, one (1) 4-pin Molex to 4-pin Molex Drive Power, one (1) USB Mini B to USB Cable, one (1) Tableau TP1 Power Supply w/AC Power Cord and one (1) soft bag.  

The T8 Kit includes one (1) Tableau T8 Forensic USB Bridge, one (1) P9 to P9 FireWire Cable, two (2) P9 to P6 Adapters, one (1) P9 to P4 Adapter, one (1) USB Mini B to USB Cable, one (1) 6" USB Extension Cable and one (1) Tableau TP1 Power Supply w/AC Power Cord and one (1) soft bag.  

The T5 Kit includes one (1) Tableau T5 Forensic USB Bridge, one (1) 8" IDE Data Cable, one (1) P9 to P9 FireWire Cable, one (1) P9 to P6 Adapter, one (1) P9 to P4 Adapter, one (1) Tableau 2.5 IDE Hard Disk Adapter, one (1) Tableau 1.8 IDE Hard Disk Adapter, one (1) 2" IDE Data Cable, one (1) Mini Type B to USB Cable, one (1) Tableau TP1 Power Supply w/AC Power Cord and one (1) soft bag.  Note:  

The "kit" part of the part number means the unit comes with all the adapters and cables needed, not just the unit itself.

The IRS requires the brand name, "Tableau" because Tableau devices are manufactured to meet digital forensic standards.  The IRS Electronic Crimes (EC) is responsible for forensically securing digital evidence in criminal investigations.  Evidence from computers must be secure using devices and processes which meet the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The IRS-EC has used the Tableau device for the past 3 years in criminal digital evidence seizures related to 100's of criminal investigations.  The EC and other Federal Agencies, including National Institute Standards and Technology and the Department of Defense, have expended considerable resources in testing and validating Tableau devices with respect to meeting forensic standard for acquiring digital evidence.  IRS-EC has spent considerable resources in testing and validating the Tableau devices to assure the devices work properly with IRS-ECs forensic software.

IRS-EC purchase of Tableau device should be considered an equipment refresh of already existing Tableau devices used for specific digital evidence acquisition.   Alteration of any other brand will hinder IRS-EC resources, and could impact criminal investigations, due to IRS-EC having to expense resources to re-test and validate another brand device against already approved forensic software. 

Delivery Requirements: Delivery terms are FOB Destination.  One unit shall consist of one CLIN each.   The kits shall be delivered in various quantities to IRS offices located nationwide.
 
QUOTE PREPARATION:  Offerors shall prepare quotes in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and shall include a completed copy of the provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial.  Responses that do not contain this information will be considered non-responsive.

Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.

1.   Storage Fees (pricing by cubic foot and monthly minimum)
2.   Records storage boxes, empty, 1.2 cubic foot (include delivery costs, if any)
3.   Retrieval Fees (define delivery times and minimum lead times):

6.   Archival Services
7.   Entry Fee
8.   Termination Fee
9.   Shredding/Destruction Services
10.  Fuel Surcharges

Potential Optional Services:  Although the OIG is not currently using these services, the OIG would like to option to have computer based inventory and bar coding should future needs require such services.  Please include pricing for these services as well, if provided by your facility.

OTHER NOTES:

Invoices will be paid monthly or quarterly (vendor's choice) in arrears via electronic funds transfer (EFT).  Invoice should itemize actual services performed.

Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of award (FAR 52.204-7).  See www.ccr.gov for more information.

The Government will apply the following evaluation criteria to identify the best value proposal(s). The evaluation criteria represent key areas of importance to be considered in the source selection decision. The elements, sub-factors and factors have been chosen to support a meaningful discrimination between and among competing proposals. A PASS/FAIL factor for NRCS certification is required. Failure to pass this factor precludes any further consideration. The proposals will then be evaluated against the Government?s requirements using five factors: Experience; Education, Quality Control; Local Knowledge; Staff Availability.
Relative Importance: Education and Local Knowledge is less important than Experience and Education. Education and Local Knowledge is divided into one sub-factor. Experience and Staff Availability, are divided into five sub-factors. When combined, Experience and Staff Availability are more important than cost and price.
The Government will perform a risk assessment on each proposal. The proposed risk assessment focuses on the risks and weaknesses associated with the proposed approach. Assessment of risk is done at the Past Performance and Technical & Management factor levels and include potential for disruption of schedule, degradation of performance, and the need for increased Government oversight, As well as the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. For any risk identified, the evaluation addresses the proposal for mitigating those risks and why that approach is or is not feasible. The following definitions are to be used for Past Performance and Technical & Management risk assessment.
High Risk-Based on offeror?s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Moderate Risk ?Based on the offeror?s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Low Risk-Based on the offeror?s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Risks may occur as a result of a particular technical approach, operational process, management plan, or as a result of the schedule and economic impacts associated with these approaches. A risk assessment factor shall be assigned for each factor.
Offerors shall provide at least three (3) Past Performance references that ascertain the offerors performance in providing the services requested in the SOW including Experience, Staff Availability, Knowledge of Local Area, Quality Control and Education.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATIONS
Questions # 1.  The bid request specifically has (8) and (3) units specified.  Is this a definite/only number required to meet bid specifications or as in the past bid specifications any quantity could be quoted even though the same unit quantities were listed?

Answer:  The end user has identified a quantity they believe will meet or exceed the 400 cfm of airflow.  The government will evaluate any innovative proposal that bids fewer units but still meets or exceeds this requirement.  A site visit is being offered, which provides contractors the opportunity to submit a proposal to meet or exceed the airflow requirement.

Questions # 2.  One of the specifications lists an air flow of ?400 cfm? which is not an accepted industry standard for diesel exhaust removal systems.  Is this spec correct or a minimum specification for reference only?

Answer:  There is no error with this specification.  This standard was derived from MacDill AFB?s Bioenvironmental Flight and the 25th Edition of the Industrial Ventilation Manual (Guidelines MacDill AFB must follow).
NOTE# 1:  The only technical evaluation will be if the proposal meets or exceeds the 400 cfm.  No other information will be considered.

NOTE# 2.  The deadline for submitting requests for clarifications is 7 Sep 07, 4 p.m. EST.

I.  REQUIREMENT:

The Contractor shall provide the following items as specified as the requirement is Brand Name only.  The 112th Signal Battalion requires purchasing four (4) each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (shelter) model number AC1209L, four each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (remote) AC1209L-R and eight each fiber optic jumper cables J-Im4-TFOCA2-FC/APC.  The fiber modems are used to extend the RF capability in order to support Phoenix satellite terminals and baseband communications equipment for the Battalion. Currently the 112th are using two sets of these models for fiber modems to provide services in the CENTCOM AOR.  Four (4) more of these sets are needed and it is needed as well that they are compatible with the set presently in use in order for the Phoenix systems can be operated  remotely and TDMA signals sent without changing any protocols or dropping the shot.  This will also cause less down time to troubleshoot a component that is not compatible with our existing architecture.  The modems required must also meet the following specifications:

?	The RF path must have transmit and receive isolation on the link
?	The modem must have an Ethernet interface using a single fiber strand.
?	The modem set will need to be furnished with a 1000M 4 channel single mode fiber reel with TFOCA II ends.  This will also require a 2 ea TFOCA II fan-out per modem set (2 meters long) with FC ends on the fan-out ends.
?	The modem must have LED status indicators for both the optics side of the links as well as the RF and Ethernet side of the links.
?	The modem must have an LED status indicator for power state.
?	The modem must be matched to 75 Ohm impedance.
?	RF Link gain must be between -2dBm to +2dBm
?	Modem optical interfaces must be SM FC/APC
?	Modem RF interfaces must be N type
?	Ethernet interface must be 8x8 Rj45
?	Link will be modeled for 1--- meters
?	The input to the optical transmitter must be capable of withstanding signal levels of -40 to 0dBm(+10dBm as absolute maximum) (RF Uplink)
?	RF Downlink maximum RF input to fiber optic transmitter is less than 0dBm.
?	Modems must operate in temperatures of -30 Degrees C to 75 Degrees C.
?	Modems will be designed to fit in standard 19 inch rack mounts, with front and rear supports.

Along with the material support of acquiring the modems the 112th requires technical support in order to ensure that this equipment is compatible with our Phoenix Satellite Communications Systems:

Pre-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the installation location, 112th Signal Battalion, Fort Bragg, NC and meet with the 112th engineers to determine specific engineering and functionality requirements of the Fiber to RF modems.

<DESC>Amended:  The final day for questions to be submitted is Thursday, September 6, 2007.  



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M. Harlan, M.D., Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, Building 10, CRC Room 5-5940, Bethesda, MD  20892.

Period and Place of Performance

The work for this project will be performed both onsite at NIDDK and offsite at the contractor?s office.  The period of performance will be Base Year plus Four (4) Option Years.  The first year is the base contract which will include the product development/testing and production/maintenance periods.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M.

<DESC>Questions & Answers

#1) Can the work be performed during normal business hours?

Answer:  Yes, providing installation will not result in disruption of service.

#2) Will the Air Force receive the batteries and provide delivery to the jobsite?

Answer:  Yes, we will receive the batteries, but delivery  must be made to Bldg. 252

#3) Will the Air Force provide a forklift to assist in the loading of the old batteries into the scrap truck?

Answer: No, we do not have a fork lift.

#4) Your specifications call for 675 amps x 20% increase @ the 8 hour rate.  This is 810 amps.  Normally, Telecom batteries are installed to provide N + 1 redundancy.  In this case, (2) strings to provide coverage with the 3rd string installed in case (1) string fails. The battery you specified will not provide the coverage requested.  The system needed is actually the GU-33.  Can we quote both?

Answer:  We would like to stay with the (3) strings of 24 ea. flooded cell batteries configuration.  Our current configuration consists of (72) GU-27.  You may quote both.  The Government has no problem looking at GU-33's as well, but I suspect that the cost will be beyond what we can afford at this time.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS 
(a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the pest control building offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.

1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the pest control building in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a proposal.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.
Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.
The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products.

The following DLAD provisions are hereby added in full text:
DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.

DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals.

All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing.  Questions should be emailed to karen.kaufman@dla.mil.  
 
Request for Proposal (RFP) due date and time is September 19, 2007 ? 2:00PM local time.
