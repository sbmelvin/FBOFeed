This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.

<DESC>&nbsp;This award derives from the Proposed Contract Action (FA8751-14-Q-0206). Award was made under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1) authority. A redacted Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document is attached to this notice.
<p>AFRL requires (QTY 3) Firmware Programmable Signal Processing PC cards that perform A/D and D/A function, Programmable Xilinx, instantly readily compatible with current AFRL mission developed firmware, drivers and software. Including input and output signal waveform capability up to 500MHz with bandwidths up to 100MHz.</p>
<p>These are replacement cards for use with AFRL mission developed firmware, drivers and software that is only compatible with these cards. The Government has determined that no other source can meet the requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If other than the specified PC Cards are purchased than the government must reinvest the cost to redevelop firmware, drivers and software to interface with a new PC Card. Furthermore, a year of additional testing will be required to substantiate the viability of a new PC Card. This substantial duplication of cost is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
