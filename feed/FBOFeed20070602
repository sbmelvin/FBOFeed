<OFFADD>Department of State, Office of Logistics Management, Acquisition Management, P.O. Box 9115 Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA, 22219, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>C -- Historical Preservation of Buildings - Evaluation and prioritization
<DESC>REQUEST FOR MARKET RESEARCH INFORMATION ONLY.  NO PROPOSALS REQUESTED.  The Department of State requests industry comment on a new requirement to evaluate historic properties at locations worldwide and use algorithms/software to prioritize them for importance, market value, and economic repair feasibility.  It is expected that a winning team would consist of historic preservation professionals with long range planning experience and Real Estate Portfolio advisors with experience in historic buildings.  We do not expect the team to have to travel overseas.  Information and data stored in Washington, DC would be used to make the assessments and prioritize the properties.

The Department is interested in learning from industry what types of contracts are being written in the commercial or government markets for these types of services and how the contract line items are organized.  We also need to know if there is already commercially available software for use in performing this type of real estate analysis or if we may need to have it developed as part of the contract.  We would like to learn how industry has organized similar work for commercial companies, state and local governments and other Federal Agencies.  Please email all suggestions, comments and letters of interest to BoufordRW@state.gov.  Due to workload please do not call.

DoS is looking for especially interested in locating 8(a) Business Development Program participants qualified for this type work.    Work is probably in one of the following NAICS codes 341310 Architecture consulting ($4.5M small business standard), 712120 Historic Buildings ($6.5M small business standard) or 531320 Real Estate appraisal services ($2.0M small business size standard).  If you are an 8(a) participant and believe you are highly qualified for this work please submit a two page capability statement by email to BoufordRW@state.gov.

DoS is also interested in GSA FSS contract holders, Hub Zone small businesses, and any other firm who believe that they are highly qualified should there not be any qualified 8(a) participants.  

All information received will be used for acquisition planning and to write a clear and concise requirements document.  Please mark proprietary information as such.
