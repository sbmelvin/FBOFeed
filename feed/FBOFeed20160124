The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<DESC>Solicitation: <br /><br />Complete Solicitation documents and drawings will be available on or about January 26, 2016.
<p>Project Title:<br /><br />Lower Jemez Fish Structure Project</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Nine (9) instream v-notch log structures designed to enhance fish habitat in the lower Jemez River were installed ca. 1989 as part of the larger Lower Jemez River Corridor Project. Seven (7) of these structures remain and are now in various states of failure, resulting in severe riverbed and bank erosion. The Forest Service intends to have the failing v-notch log structures removed from the lower Jemez River, and restore the riverbed and banks to stable condition.</p>
<p>Scope of Contract and Description:<br /><br />This solicitation is for the river restoration construction of four (4) sections within an approximately 3-mile reach of the Jemez River on the Jemez Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest. This project includes the one section located at The Bluffs and three sections at the Spanish Queen public use sites, with a bid option that includes San Diego and Las Casitas public use sites separately. The Vista Linda site will not be a part of this contract. The goal of the project is river restoration, focused on reducing erosion and sedimentation associated with the failing structures, including removal of the existing structures and stabilization of the riverbed and banks. A secondary goal is to improve instream habitat within these river sections by reducing the overall bankfull width/depth ratio, which will help reduce water temperatures and increase the quantity of pool habitat. The restoration construction incorporates natural channel design techniques for this Rosgen C3 reach, including the use of large woody debris (LWD) and boulders in the channel and floodplain. Increasing LWD and boulder placement will also increase pool habitat over time as well as promote bar formation and woody riparian vegetation establishment.&nbsp; The NAICS Code is 237990.<br /><br />The Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Removal existing v-notch log structures and disposal of removed material,<br />&bull; Procurement of all needed material as specified by the design (design provided by the Forest Service),<br />&bull; Construction of structures as designed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary perform the work specified in the contract.</p>
<p>The performance period will be starting approximately late February early March, 2016. Contract time will be 120 calendar days.<br /><br />This project is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside Project</p>

The Government Range is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.<br /><br />A pre-bid meeting, at&nbsp;the project location,&nbsp;will be scheduled after the complete solicitation pacakage and drawings have been posted on FedBizOps.&nbsp; Keep watching this notice for details.&nbsp; While not mandatory, attendance at the pre-bid meeting is highly encouraged for all interested contractors.<br /><br />The pre-bid meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, February 02, 2016 at 11:00 AM MDT.&nbsp; The location is the Jemez Ranger District Office in Jemez Springs, NM 87025.
