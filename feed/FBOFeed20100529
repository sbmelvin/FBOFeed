<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA’s requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA’s requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Enhanced Clinical Decision Support for VHA Computer-based Patient Record System (CPRS) Innovation #209 (functional prototype).
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The VA’s Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system, Computer Patient Record System (CPRS), Clinical Decision Support is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, the VA’s demand for “smarter,” knowledge-driven applications has outstripped the capabilities of the CPRS Clinical Reminders package, which is the closest analog to an inference capability to support CDS.  This is inhibiting development of clinical applications and the absence of an Application Programming Interface to a clinical inference infrastructure has frustrated the development of knowledge-driven applications beyond clinical reminders as implemented in the CPRS Clinical Reminders package.  VistA is not equipped for interfacing to external applications that use “standards-based” approaches to either request data or provide CDS services.  CPRS offers no tools for development of “standards-based” computable knowledge and no support for “standards-based” interchange of such knowledge with non-VA entities and its absence of loosely-coupled support for inference presents a challenge to migration to a re-engineered HealtheVet VistA .
VA’s VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  
Requirements
The objective of this prototype is to successfully link a “standards-based” decision support framework to CPRS, demonstrating replacement of the current clinical reminder capability as an initial application.  Because the framework will include rules with both "logic" and "action" components (unlike the current clinical reminder system), it will also be possible to demonstrate other forms of integration with CPRS, such as recommending additions to the problem list based on data, chaining screening and evaluation reminders, etc.  In addition, it will be possible to demonstrate uses of the framework for non-traditional applications, such as a patient report card.   One of the major technical components of this project will be exploration of a “standards-based” interface to VistA for data services: the Health Level Seven (HL7) Guideline Expression Language
Object-oriented query and logical expression language for clinical decision support (GELLO) interface http://www.openclinical.org/gmm_gello.html.
The proposed innovation project has four key aspects:
 	Connection of a free-standing, standards-based CDS engine to CPRS.
 	Development of a standards-based interface to VistA (HL7 GELLO).
 	Development of computable knowledge in a shareable, standards-based representation.
 	Exploration of sample applications of the technology introduced.
•	Replication of a meaningful set of Clinical Reminders 
•	Generation of a Patient Report Card based on accepted guidelines
•	Supplementation of traditional Clinical Reminders with a significant and diverse set clinically-focused ‘reminders’ that are independent of traditional CPRS reminders.

VA is seeking qualified contractors to provide a free-standing “standards-based” Clinical Decision Support (CDS) inference framework that will support an “authoring environment and execution engine,” in either an open source or commercial off the shelf (COTS) solution.  Contractors will develop a mechanism for the engine to acquire patient data from VistA, preferably multi-site data, and preferably using a standards-based approach.  The solution will implement three sample applications of the technology introduced:
a.	Replication of a meaningful set of Clinical Reminders 
b.	Generation of a Patient Report Card based on accepted guidelines
c.	Supplementation of traditional Clinical Reminders with a page of “Tidbits from the Computer” (homage to the CARE system at Regenstrief) that are of clinical interest but not driven by performance measures http://www.regenstrief.org/.
Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 10 pages.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information via electronically (email) no later than June 11th, 2010 at 4PM EST to VA Contracting Officer:  Paula L. Poppy, Chief of Bedford Contracting Office, paula.poppy@va.gov.  
1.Past Experience – Provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects completed within the last three years for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.  
a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, Cost Reimbursement or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project, including difficulties and successes
e.	Your company’s role and services provided for each project.
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications – Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

4.	Commercial availability – Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
5.	Socio-Economic Status – Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA’s VetBiz repository?
6.	Price information – Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
Other Market Information – Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.
