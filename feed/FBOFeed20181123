This project will be set aside 100% for Small Businesses under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237310 -- Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction with a size standard of $36.5 million.
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is for an upcoming solicitation that is for a project to construct improvements of Yolo County Road 31 (CR 31) per the Construction Documents [which will be provided with the solicitation].  The proposed construction improvements will mitigate traffic impacts by: 1) adding a dedicated eastbound left-turn lane on CR 31 at the project driveway; 2) maintain an existing six-foot Class II bikeway on both sides of CR 31 along the project frontage; 3) constructing a westbound right-turn deceleration taper on CR 31 at the project driveway; and 4) modifying the centerline striping along CR 31 to prohibit passing in the vicinity of the project driveway.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be 90 calendar days after issuance of the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Per FAR 36.204, the estimated price range of the resultant construction project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be procured as a Request for Proposals (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 and 36 procedures with Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria [to be provided in the solicitation].</p>

<p>A formal site visit is NOT planned. *There is currently construction being performed at the site; therefore, it is asked that there be no disturbance to the current contractor.*</p>
<p>The official SAM website is located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  Contractors are encouraged to complete SAM registration as soon as possible; the government may not delay award for the purpose of allowing a contractor additional time to register in SAM.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p><br />The National Institute of Health, Clinical Center (CC) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to The BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA 92121 on a sole source basis to procure an instrumentation package inclusive of the reagent rental, proprietary reagents, consumables, tests and preventative and corrective maintenance service for equipment.</p>
<p>The comprehensive system of the instrument, reagents, and service are necessary to produce complete testing results and are not sold in the U.S. by any distributors or other third parties, without the "PROPRIETARY" reagents patients in the Clinical Center cannot receive the cell therapy necessary for their treatment per protocols at NIH. Since the supplies are proprietary, there is only one supplier whose products can fit into the instrumentation; any other supply or service could cause the cancellation of the protocol/delays in completion of the protocol. Any deviation from the protocol must be reported to the FDA for non-compliance. Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) will telephone or e-mail request for reagents and supplies on a needed basis. Period of Performance shall be for a base year of twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The equipment and supply lists including quantities are attached to this notice and titled: Attachment 1 - List of Equipment and Attachment 2 - List of Supplies. The exact quantity of supplies cannot be estimated at the time of award, therefore an IDIQ contract type is most advantageous for this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the contract authority of the test program for commercial items prescribed in FAR Subpart 13.5.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325413 with a large small business standard size of 1,250 employees.<br /><br />Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities.</p>

As the OEM Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co., deems necessary to maintain the equipment in accordance with their required specifications, and have trained certified engineers and parts to maintain the equipment. Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co., does not recognize nor authorize any 3rd party repair sources. Any offeror that has an agreement to provide certified Becton, Dickinson Field Service Engineers shall demonstrate by providing a sign letter from the OEM confirming 3rd-Party vendor is authorized to perform the requested service agreement.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources who can provide the required service agreement renewal may submit a response that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-19-1940621) to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 10:00 am eastern standard time Monday, December 3, 2018. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #3:</span></strong><br /><br />
<div>Q: Please confirm that electronic delivery to email addresses identified in RFP will suffice and that physical delivery of the proposal is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />A: It is confirmed that the RFP only needs to be delivered electronically.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: In Task 2, please provide the context or additional details regarding "transformer charging."</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: The correct name for the "transformer charging" function is "transformer loading." It is related to the load control of the power transformers installed in the substations, which can be performed by IEDs or other alternatives that will be studied in this TOR. In addition, we have the tap-change function that controls the voltage through the tap-change of the power transformers that can be performed by dedicated systems or by other automation systems. Both of cases we would like evaluated in the proposal.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: From Task 5, in addition to Aparecida, Sao Sebastiao, Sul and Leste substations, please clarify how many substations shall be included in the implementation plan.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: CTEEP intends to make the implementation plan for these 4 substations. In addition to these, we have more than 25 substations that have depreciated technical and regulatory service life. These more than 25 substations are mapped in our investment plan and will be modernized based on the criteria, requirements and on the methodologies studied and proposed in the TOR.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: From Task 5, please provide the context or additional details regarding "saturation problems."</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: Increasingly, the substation primary equipment will suffer from problems of overcoming, mainly caused by the increase in short-circuit capacities of the facilities. This makes it necessary to know new solutions of primary equipment to mitigate this type of problem. Typically, "saturation problems" are mainly related to conventional instrument current transformers. As CTEEP is aware, primary equipment exists with new technology that uses non-conventional instrument transformers (NCIT). These could be installed in the substations, eliminating problems of saturation, improving the safety of people in the substations, and avoiding the risk of opening of circuits of current converters. CTEEP imagines that the NCIT are designed to operate without saturation problems with greater safety and reliability. The goal is to understand these technologies better and consider installing them in CTEEP's substations.</div>

<DESC>The United States Government, Transportation Security Administration intends to award a lease extension, for a term of five (5) years (five, 1-year option periods), using other than full and open competition to Signature Flight Support, Inc. at the General Aviation hangar at Ronald Regan Washington National Airport (DCA) to commence on 01/01/2019.
<p>This justification applies to all TSA continuing need requirements for support and administrative work space that are required to be on airport property at DCA. TSA space must be located on-airport to effectively carry out its mission in direct airport support of aviation security and other functions. TSA has a current lease with which will expire on 12/31/2018.</p>
<p>The Government requires office space yielding a minimum of 399 Rentable sq. ft. /399 ANSI/BOMA office area. The space must be located on-airport grounds of the DCA airport. The lease shall include all services, supplies, and utilities as part of the rental consideration. Due to mission critical duties, the space must be accessible by major arterial roads and/ or public transportation systems to DCA airport terminal. Additional requirements are to have sufficient parking for visitors, and the ability to securely house a 24-hour operation within the space.</p>
<p>The Government may consider alternative space if economically advantageous; otherwise the Government intends to pursue a sole source action for lease extension. All interested parties should be aware that the Government will consider the cost of relocation, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should relocate. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. TSA will not reimburse for any costs incurred by interested parties in providing a notification of interest and/or capability statement in response to this posting.</p>
<p>To submit a location for inspection, contact this office by Tuesday, November 30, 2018. (Submissions by other than the owner or manager of a property or space off airport grounds must be accompanied by a letter from the owner granting permission to make a general offering of the space as well as the information below:</p>
<p>WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>Building Name and Address, distance from airport terminal, Rentable and Usable Square Footage, Fully Serviced Rental rate and Common Area Factor, available parking and Building Floor plans. Interested parties should send this information in writing, via email to Charlotte.Carney1@tsa.dhs.gov by the date specified above and ensure receipt by the Government.)</p>
