<CONTACT>Amy Molnar Procurement Clerk 7022938779     amolnar@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for repairing damage to penstocks. Work to be performed under this solicitation consists of water containment/diversion, surface preparation and painting of damaged surface areas on the interior of the penstocks at Hoover Dam. The four penstocks at Hoover Dam are named: Upper Nevada, Lower Nevada, Upper Arizona, and Lower Arizona. This specification is not for full repair of the penstocks just the areas of the interior portion that are damaged. The Upper Nevada penstock will be the first repaired with options to repair the remaining three penstocks. Qualified contractors shall have current SSPC-QP-1 and SSPC-QP-2 certifications. The principal components of repairing each Penstock include the following: (1) furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the internal 30 foot diameter penstock sections. The 30 foot diameter section of the upper penstocks include a 90 degree elbow that is nearly 70 feet tall and also a section of 30 foot diameter penstock that is 1400 linear feet of nearly horizontal pipe. The 30 foot diameter sections of the lower penstocks include a 45 degree elbow that is 260 feet high and 340 linear feet long and also included is 1200 linear feet of nearly horizontal pipe; and (2) furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the internal 13 foot diameter penstock sections. The 13 foot diameter laterals in the lower penstocks are nearly horizontal. However, the upper penstock 13 foot diameter laterals are angled at 45 degrees. Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long; (3) furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the scroll cases; (4) coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior 30 foot diameter and 13 foot diameter penstock sections. Government has estimated that a total of approximately 15,000 square feet of isolated spot repair to the protective coating of the interior surface will be necessary on each penstock; (5) surface preparation and furnishing and applying protective coating for isolated spot repair of damaged areas in scroll cases; (6) water diversion of approximately 500-1000 gpm leakage within the penstock will be necessary. The work is located at Hoover Dam and Powerplant, approximately 8 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona. This contract is for a base year with three optional year schedules, the Government may extend the term of this contract by exercise of three option years. It is Reclamation's intent to award one base year contract for spot coating repair work. Each contract may be issued as a one-year contract with one one-year extension option (a potential contract duration of 4 years) or for a single one-year period from the date of award. The repair work on the interior penstocks must be completed during a time when the units are taken out of service. The scheduled dates for the planned outage periods will be included in the solicitation.

<CONTACT>William Richardson, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2653, Fax 770-488-2671, Email rtr4@cdc.gov - William Richardson, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2653, Fax 770-488-2671, Email rtr4@cdc.gov
<DESC>This contract shall provide for the collection and delivery of  serum specimens suitable for the validation of assays for distinguishing recent from longstanding infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  Suitable panels are to include specimens from persons with all known viral subtypes of HIV-1.

The contractor(s) shall obtain and deliver specimen sets from persons who have seroconverted to HIV-1.  Either of two methods may be used.  For Method 1, the contractor may identify and gain access to seroconversion specimens which meet the criteria that have already been collected for other purposes (e.g., as part of longitudinal studies).  For Method 2, the contractor shall develop a mechanism for identifying persons who have recently become infected with HIV-1 after previously testing negative, obtain the first HIV-1 antibody-positive specimen and prospectively collect 3 serum specimens over a period of one year from the first antibody positive specimen.
	
C.2.2.  BACKGROUND AND NEED

Infection with HIV-1 is most commonly diagnosed by the detection of antibodies to components of the virus in serum or plasma.  Once an individual is infected, circulating antibodies persist throughout the years-long course of HIV disease.  Determining whether newly diagnosed infections are recent has important epidemiologic implications for calculating incidence of HIV infection, that is, the number of new cases per year.  Incidence measurements are essential to help to identify recent patterns of transmission, and to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission of the virus.  Identifying recent infection may also have implications for clinical treatment, as some evidence suggests specific therapeutic regimens offered shortly after infection may have benefit for improving the long-term course of HIV disease.

Several in vitro diagnostic strategies have been developed to distinguish incident (recent) from prevalent (longstanding) infection by detecting differences in antibody responses to HIV-1 early in the course of infection.  These assays differ in their sensitivity for recent infection, and in the time identified by the assay as recent, that is, the period after infection with the virus during which the assay gives a definitive result (referred to as the window period).  For some assays, the duration of this window period appears to differ with specimens from persons infected with different viral subtypes of HIV-1.  For the purpose of calculating incidence, the optimal window period is 150-180 days.  Evaluating candidate assays and accurately determining the length of the window period for different viral subtypes require panels of specimens from persons who have been recently infected with HIV-1 and seroconverted (that is, developed an antibody response to the virus).  
 
The necessary specimen panel requires:

a)The date of the last negative HIV test;
b)The date of the first positive HIV test, less than 1 year after the last negative test;
c)Four or more specimens (including the first positive specimen) spaced approximately 3 months apart.

It is not essential that specimens be evenly spaced, but the specimen set must span a period of at least one year after the first positive test.

To date, evaluation of candidate assays have used specimens from recently infected persons (seroconverter panels) collected as part of longitudinal studies, or collected by commercial firms, often from blood or plasma donors who have become infected with HIV.  Such seroconverter panels are scare, especially those with specimens spanning at least one year after seroconversion.  Lack of suitable seroconverter specimen sets impedes the development and evaluation of assays for recent infection.
									
C.2.3.  CONTRACT PURPOSE
	
The contractor(s) shall obtain and deliver specimen sets from persons who have seroconverted to HIV-1.  Two methods may be used by the contractor or the contractor’s subcontractor.  For the first method, the contractor may identify and gain access to seroconversion specimens which meet the criteria that have already been collected for other purposes (e.g., as part of longitudinal studies).  For the second method, the contractor or the contractor’s subcontractor shall develop a mechanism for identifying persons who have recently become infected with HIV-1 (e.g., persons who become antibody positive after recently testing antibody negative, or persons who are p24 antigen positive but HIV antibody negative), obtain the first HIV-1 antibody-positive specimen and prospectively collect 3 serum specimens over a period of one year from the first antibody positive specimen.

C.2.4.	SCOPE OF WORK
	
A. The contractor shall provide labor, technology, materials, supplies, equipment, travel, transportation, and other incidentals necessary to acquire the necessary panels of serum specimens and transport the specimens to the CDC storage facility in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

B. The contractor must identify and acquire panels of at least four specimens from the same individual that meet the following criteria:

1) The first HIV-1 antibody positive specimen from a person known to have seroconverted to HIV-1, for whom the date of a previous negative test is available and known to be less than one year from the first positive test; or from a person with other laboratory evidence of recent seroconversion (e.g., HIV p24 antigen positive, HIV antibody negative);

2) Three subsequent specimens spaced approximately three months apart, with the last specimen collected at least one year but less than two years after the first positive specimen.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, Office of the Secretary intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and 41 USC 253(c)(3), with Mitretek Systems, Falls Church, Virginia for services in support of information technology policy development and technical review.   The Department seeks a contractor to conduct an objective, independent, knowledgeable, rigorous, and in-depth review and analysis of information technology (IT) policy and project documentation, IT technical statements of work and proposals, and IT management issues.  The sole source justification is based on the government’s need that the contractor not have any conflicting role that might bias its judgment in carrying out tasks under this contract, and that the contractor not be in a position to gain or be perceived as gaining an unfair competitive advantage as a result of conducting tasks under this contract for the Department of Commerce.  This applies not only to the contractor but to any other organization that has or is perceived to have a business relationship with the contractor that may lead to a conflict of interest.  The proposed contractor, Mitretek, is a 501(c)(3) corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest.  As stated in its articles of incorporation, the nature of Mitretek=s business is exclusively charitable, educational, and scientific.  Its primary purpose is Ato carry on scientific research in the public interest in order to provide a public benefit through the application of science and technology Y@  Mitretek has no stockholders, but is administered as a public trust by a board of trustees made up of eminent citizens. Mitretek, as a nonprofit corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest, operates in a manner that meets the spirit and specific requirements of the conflict of interest avoidance criteria stated above.  Mitretek does not manufacture or promote any commercial products, does not provide routine services (such as computer system operations), and does not work for or formally compete against profit-seeking firms.  In addition to the above safeguards against organizational conflict of interest, Mitretek has in place corporate policies and procedures that guard against individual trustees=, officers=, and employees= personal interests conflicting with Mitretek=s work.  Based on its corporate capabilities and demonstrated experience, Mitretek is also well qualified to provide the technical policy support work necessary to meet this requirement.  Mitretek is uniquely qualified to meet the Department’s requirements.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 54151, and the size standard is $21 million.*** This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award under other than full and open competition procedures and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals.  Information received by June 9, 2003 will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination not to open the subject requirement to competition is made solely at the discretion of the Government.***Questions regarding this notice shall be sent to Donna Calacone, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDC's) Test and Evaluation Directorate has a requirement to continue Airborne Test and Measurements Support (ATMS) work until a follow-on contract competition can be completed in August 2004. During th e period following depletion of remaining level-of-effort hours under the ATMS contract and the replacement contract being placed into full service, several critical flight tests are scheduled that require ATMS services to provide critical optical test dat a and intercept verification data necessary to meet demonstration validation program requirements.  To bridge this gap, USASMDC plans, pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, to award a contract modification to continue ATMS effort under exist ing Contract DASG60-99-C-0067 on a sole source basis with the incumbent ATMS contractor, Aeromet, Inc., of Tulsa, OK. This effort continues the prior work of Aeromet in operating, maintaining, improving and modernizing two airborne sensor platforms, sensor s, and associated support equipment under various competitively awarded contracts since the  inception of the ATMS program.  The modification does not extend the period of performance of the contract but will add approximately 160,000 level-of-effort hours  to be expended by 23 August 2004.  It has been determined that award of these additional hours to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered by competition.  This action will provide t he continued availability of the highly specialized ATMS services to conduct airborne optical measurements on targets of interest to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), USASMDC, the Program Executive Office for Air and Missile Defense (PEO-AMD), and other go vernment programs and agencies.  The objective of this effort is to provide technical analyses of mission test requirements with respect to measurement capabilities, mission planning support for mission conduct and range coordination, sensor and aircraft i ntegration activities, sensor operations and maintenance to support data collection, reduction and analysis of that data to provide infrared signatures along with an assessment of its impact to theater and strategic ballistic missile systems, and improveme nt and modernization of the airborne platforms and associated support equipment.  These activities will be conducted at the contractor facility and/or CONUS/OCONUS sites (U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll, Eastern Test Range, Western Test Range, White Sands Missil e Range, etc.).  A TOP SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding capability are required for this effort.  Written responses must cite the synopsis number for this notice and be submitted to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC-CM-AK/Mr. O. Wayne Koger, P.O.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the medical school and health sciences university of the Department of Defense, intends to procure on a sole source basis a mobile, fully automated nucleic acid extraction/purification system to extract and purify DNA from bacterial, yeast, mammalian cells and plasmids.  The resulting DNA will be used in fluorescent DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, transformations, transfections, and other enzymatic mainpulations which require high purity DNA.  The system must be fully automated.  Cultures from which DNA will be extracted must be transferred into the machine for unattended processing, with no further intervention required by the end user.  To achieve full automation, the system must have a centrifuge.  To avoid cross contamination, there must be no pipetting of samples; transference from tube to tube must be accomplished by pouring.  The purified DNA must be pure enough for use in fluorescent DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, transformations, transfections, and other enzymatic manipulations.  The system must be floor standing and mobile (i.e., on wheels) for transport between departments having very limited space.  The dimensions of the unit must not exceed 30 inches wide x 26 inches long by 60 inches high.  Input samples may be high-copy bacterial plasmids, low-copy bacterial plasmids, yeast plasmids, lambda, plant material, mouse tail and mammalian cells.  The system must process 12 to 48 samples per run.  The system must have the ability to process 0.5 to 3 ml volumes introduced in tube format, with the ability to grow cultures directly in these tubes.  The yield must be up to 8ug of plasma DNA.

<DESC>The USAID Regional Contracting Office in Budapest, Hungary intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Albania to solicit proposals from organizations interested in implementing an Umbrella Anti-Trafficking Initiative in Albania for such   activities which include awarding & administering small grants to other actors in anti-trafficking. Its main function will be that of coordination with the government, other donors, and the NGO partners who are currently working in anti-trafficking. At the same time, offerors shall propose how they would increase collaboration among USAID, the government, and other donors on anti-trafficking issues. Proposals must build flexibility, creativity, and periodic reassessments into their approach so that the ever-evolving nature of the problem and the responses by the traffickers are addressed.  The approach that USAID requires is to leverage, mobilize, and focus the many positive efforts that are now working independently.  Incentives need to be built into the grant program to be able to coalesce and focus energy and resources.  The selected contractor to implement the specific activities in support of USAID’s Anti-Trafficking Initiative will provide coordination, and technical support at the national and regional level to leverage existing activities conducted in the sector by a variety of NGOs and Government of Albania Agencies.  Some of the activities for the Anti-Trafficking Initiative will include 1.)Establishment of a qualified network of NGOs to determine areas of specialization to rationally divide tasks and activity areas; 2.) Coordination of all planning and implementation activities of USAID-funded Cooperating Agencies, national, and international agencies working in the sector; 3.) Coordination of a yearly “Lessons Learned” meeting with partners to review and assess how well the regional activities are being implemented and share achievements, model approaches, and results, 4.) The enabling of NGOs and others to improve their linkages to prosecutors and police; 5.) Providing assistance to NGOs and service providers towards the improvement of their management and skills capacities; and 6.) Ensuring technical support to approaches to prevention through public information and media and technical expertise in human and psychological support. Anticipated outcomes for this Initiative include the reduction of the successful recruit and trafficking of children, women, and girls and the successful reintegration of children, women, and girls in their respective families (where possible), in independent housing, and/or in foster care placements to avoid their returning to the trafficking situation they left. The period of performance will be 3 years with a total estimated cost of approximately $4.5 million. The RFP will be issued by May 15, 2003. Organizations may express in writing (e-mail or fax) interest in this contract competition either by fax or email (Email preferred) to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Riana Napitupulu at rnapitupulu@usaid.gov  and to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Orion Yeandel at oyeandel@usaid.gov  and Fax No. (36-1) 475-4991 or 475-4988.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is seeking a responsible contractor to provide services to examine the border health workforce and relevant population characteristics by county.   This will include collecting data (no primary data collection will be involved), describing and analyzing the data, and preparing a final report.  It will be necessary to define the border health workforce infrastructure while describing who and what constitutes the health workforce in the 50 border counties (including those in CA, TX, NM, AZ, and FL).  In addition to the 239 counties covered by the Health Education Tracing Center (HETC) program should also be characterized. The Government anticipates awarding a twelve-month contract. This acquisition is being conducted under Full and Open competition. The solicitation will be issued on or about April 10, 2003. It will be available at the Government website at www.fbo.gov in the Main Menu under HHS, Offices, Health Resources and Services Administration, Locations, Division of Grants and Procurement Management. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the site for amendments to the solicitation. To be included on our List of Potential Offerors, submit your name, address and phone number to the Contract Specialist at amcfarlane@hrsa.gov.  The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING RFQ 231-HAB-013(03)(DLC):

1.Q.  WHAT IS THE AMOUNT BUDGETED FOR THIS PROJECT?

1.A. The offering letter states that this will be awarded under FAR Part 13, which is under $100,000.

2.Q.  IS THE APPLICANT ORGANIZATION REQUIRED TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS? IF SO, WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE UNDER THIS RFQ?  WILL THE FUNDED ORGANIZATION BE CONSTRAINED IN THE TYPE OF SIZE OF BUSINESS IT MAY SUBCONTRACT WITH?

2.A.  This is a competing requirement, all parties may response.

3.Q.  WHY IS AN RFQ BEING ISSUED NOW FOR A 12-MONTH CONTRACT RATHER THAN CONTINUING THE PREVIOUS GRANTEE'S WORK WITH ANOTHER GRANT?

3.A.  We are competing this because the previous contractor received the original award under a Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) grant of a three-year duration.  Recent changes in the ways in which HRSA may award contracts preclude our extending SPNS grants for additional work.

4.Q.  CAN YOU TELL ME WHO IS THE CURRENT CONTRACTOR FOR THIS PROJECT. IF THERE IS ONE, AND IS THERE ANYWAY OF OBTAINING A "REPORT CARD" ON HOW THIS CONTRACTOR, IF THERE IS ONE, HAS PERFORMED DURING THE LAST CONTRACT PERIOD?

4.A.  THE CURRENT CONTRACTOR IS THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA (IDSA).  WHILE WE HAVE ISSUED NO FORMAL "REPORT CARD" ON IDSA, THEIR PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY.

<DESC>The FAA's Traffic Flow and Enterprise Management (TF&EM) Integrated Product Team (IPT), AUA-700, is responsible for developing and deploying technology to support the safe and efficient movement of aircraft through the NAS.  They are responsible for ensuring that new TFM systems and technologies provide NAS-level benefits in addition to providing localized benefits within a particular volume of airspace or phase of flight.  AUA-700 is planning for the modernization of the current TFM system. Modernization of the existing TFM system will replace portions of the existing automation systems with a modernized automation environment that supports both legacy and new functional capabilities.  The automation systems to be modernized by the TFM-M program include the current TFM centralized processing capability located at the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, MA; the TFM subsystems located at the FAA Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) in Herndon, VA and at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in Atlantic City, NJ; and the TFM subsystems located at various ATC facilities. This Screening Information Request (hereafter referred to as SIR1) is being conducted to identify qualified technical sources for a contract to design, develop, test and implement the modernized TFM system.  This contract shall also have options for additional Maintenance and Training Tasks  and Engineering Services on an as-ordered basis by the Government.    Projected award of a contract is anticipated by June 2004, with a period of performance from the date of award for a minimum of one (1) year and a maximum of twelve (12) years inclusive of all options. The Government desires unlimited rights to all data and computer software produced under this contract in accordance with FAAAMS provision 3.5-13 (Rights in Data  General)(October 96).

SIR1 proper consists of the following sections: 1.Cover letter, 2.Section C, Draft Statement of Work, 3.Section L, Capabilities Statement Requirements, 4.Section M, Evaluation Factors, 5.Acronym List, and 6. Representations and Certifications and Business Declaration Form The draft Statement of Work identifies the preliminary areas of tasking that are expected to be required in the TFM-M Program.  Interested parties responding to SIR1 should carefully consider if they have all the expertise required to meet the Government's expected tasking.  The purpose of the evaluation is to identify those Offerors that have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform these tasks. In the case where multiple vendors have teamed together to submit a Capabilities Statement, the Government will consider the capabilities of all members of the Team during the evaluation.  Cost information is not requested. SIR1 is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government.  SIR1 does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. An Offeror must be found qualified under SIR1 in order to submit a proposal under the subsequent TFM-M RFO/SIR (SIR 2).   Offerors shall be notified in writing whether they qualify for SIR2.   If selected as a qualified source for SIR2, the qualified Offeror's team shall be the only team permitted to submit a SIR 2 proposal.  Changes in teaming arrangements after SIR1 qualification will invalidate Offeror eligibility for consideration under SIR2 unless prior approval is obtained by the Contracting Officer in the case of unusual circumstances.

Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period and four one-year options.  The lowest price technically acceptable selection process will be used with any resulting award being firm-fixed price service contract.  Technical and cost proposals will be required.

The solicitation will be available on or about April 21, 2003, and will be available solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The ADAS will perform all required data acquisition and performance calculations defined in the LTS101-750B-2 Original Engineering Manufacture Testing Instruction (OEM-TI) 8124 revision B.  The basic system will consist of necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer, and magnetic media.  It shall also have capability to perform diagnostics/troubleshooting on the engine under test and determine engine stability to enable the system to automatically record data at engine stabilization.  The ADAS will display all pertinent parameters for the engine under test, their target values, and operator instructions in accordance with the OEM-TI 8124.  This system shall be self-calibrating.  The ADAS system and all related upgrades must be compatible with the T700 Engine Test Cell and also adaptable to all future upgrades.  The T700 Engine Test cell has a CMR-ADAS that is an operator prompted and controlled computer based data acquisition system that monitors, conditions, processes, calculates, records and displays in graphic/animated formats various channels of engine/dynamometer generated electrical signals that represent specific engine/dynamometer operating parameters.  The CMR-ADAS performs the same functions on electrical signals generated by thermocouples and a barometric pressure transducer that when processed by the CMR-ADAS, equate to the ambient conditions (temperature and barometric pressure) in the engine run room.  The resulting ambient condition valves are also used by the CMR-ADAS to calculate certain engine performance factors such as the Shaft Horse Power output of the engine under test.  It shall be contractor's responsibility to acquire any and all specification data concerning the Original Engineering Manufacture Testing Instruction (OEM-TI) 8124 revision B prior to award.  Interested companies are encouraged to respond to this announcement as soon as possible.  Companies should provide a summary of their capabilities and their expected ability to meet the requirements above.  Responses should include: a) name and address of the contractor; b) point of contact including name, title, phone and email address; c) company brochures or descriptive literature; d) business size of the company/contractor, average annual revenue for the past three years and the number of employees; e) whether the business is currently classified as a Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a) and/or Women Owned, Hub Zone Small Business, Veteran Owned or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business in terms of the NAICS code for this sources sought.  The NAICS code related to this potential acquisition is 334513.  Responses should be submitted no later than 5 May 2003 to the following email address: ccox@arsc.uscg.mil or sent via facsimile to: (252) 335-6849.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as an offer or a quote.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting future solicitation.  All submitted materials would be designated for Government Use Only.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow up information requests.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is interested in receiving information on non-developmental battlefield Command & Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Systems as potential alternatives to systems currently fielded to ground forces in the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army.

MARCORSYSCOM has determined that ground battlefield C4I systems currently fielded to Marine Corps and US Army ground maneuver forces do not adequately meet current Marine Corps requirements and that planned enhancements of these systems may not fully support predicted requirements.

This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought will serve as the first step to identify potential alternatives to currently fielded ground battlefield C4I systems that possess an appropriate level of developmental maturity and growth potential for possible use in the MAGTAF Expeditionary Force Family of Vehicles (MEFFV).  MARCORSYSCOM will potentially hold a full and open competition this fiscal year to study and evaluate one or more selected systems on a ground combat system.

Proposed systems should include a combination of non-developmental software and hardware components already in an operational configuration with planned developmental enhancements and growth potential.  Planned developmental enhancements may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology.  

Proposed systems shall offer a secure means to:
1)	Receive, store, retrieve, create, modify, export, import and display map overlays, operational messages/reports, and position information via tactical radios, networks, and/or wire lines;
2)	Merge intelligence data from a wide array of collection sources, both onboard and off-board;
3)	Provide streamlined combined arms planning and on-the-move C2 capabilities at the regimental level and below;
4)	Provide, or provide the potential for, interoperability with fielded joint and combined arms U.S. maneuver battlefield C4I systems;
5)	Depict real-time, accurate threat and friendly combined arms force position information;
6)	Offer the capability for full system integration with sensors/weapons to include cross-platform automatic laying of weapons systems to identified threats; 
7)	Possess the capability or near-term potential to overlay operational graphics and threat/friendly positions on to a 3-dimensional depiction of the battlefield to support operational understanding and operational rehearsals; and,
8)	Possess the capability or near-term potential to overlay operational graphics and threat/friendly positions on onboard acquisition systems (i.e. operational graphics overlaid on thermal sight imagery).

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Marine Corps to procure subject system. The Government is only seeking possible sources for future needs. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Information may be submitted any time during the above stated period.  There is no specific format or outline for providing such vendor information.  However, it is requested that interested sources provide sufficient descriptive literature and other pertinent information to provide the fullest understanding of the system capabilities.

The Government is not liable for any costs associated with the submittal of such vendor information.

<CONTACT>Mark Ready, Buyer, Phone 405-739-4374, Fax 405-739-4452, Email Charles.Ready@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>Sources Sought Notice

Due to the frequent mishap history and increased maintenance problems with oil-cooled air cycle machines (ACM) in the C/KC-135 fleet, the USAF would like to investigate the possibility of using an air-cooled ACM or an oil temperature sensing system to prevent damage to the ACM before overheating.  Before the USAF decides which action to take, it requests the following estimate for the costs, sources, and schedules for both plans.  

The first plan would be to develop an oil temperature sensing system that would warn the crew when the oil temperature in the ACM reaches an extreme high temperature that would cause the ACM to malfunction or oil to be burned, producing smoke in the cockpit.  If the oil temperature sensing system is ignored, not manually shut-off, by the flight crew, the system would automatically shut down the ACM to prevent damage to the aircraft’s cooling system and possible catastrophic failure to the aircraft.    

The second plan would involve replacing the oil-cooled ACM altogether, P/N 206090-2-1, manufactured by Airesearch (now part of Allied Signal Corp) with an air-cooled ACM.  The new air-cooled ACM would replace all oil-cooled ACM’s in the KC-135 fleet.

This is just a request to determine the feasiblility of both plans according to the kind of cost estimates we receive.  Request that those interested or need more information in either or both plans contact 2nd Lt. William Dalton at Tinker AFB.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Miami, Florida intends to procure scientific expertise and technical support for isolation of microsatellite DNA loci from a genomic DNA library built from adult mutton snapper from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  In order to effectively manage reef fish populations, managers need to have information not only about mortality (natural and fishing) but about recruitment as well.  NMFS is studying a population of mutton snapper in the Dry Tortugas, recently protected by virtue of their habitat being declared an ecological reserve.  This functionally protects them from fishing mortality, and should thus allow them to repopulate and potentially contribute many recruits to the rest of the Florida reef tract.  Equally important, however, is to determine the proportion of these fish that are resident and how many come from other upstream areas such as the Caribbean.  The task in this project is to determine if mutton snapper from the population in the Dry Trotugas are genetically linked to know spawning aggregations in Belize and Honduras.  The physical oceanography of the Caribbean region is such that it is possible that larvae spawned there might be carried to the Florida region.  The knowledge that larvae from downstream are able to survive and grow into adult fish taking up residence in the reserve would contribute valuable input into the management process for the reserve.   The University of North Carolina at Wilmington is the only university that currently has the technical staff on hand and currently trained in the full complement of genetic data analysis methodologies necessary for the completion of this project.  The intended procurement is for research for which the Government intends to acquire from one source, The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a purchase order to The University of North Carolina at Wilmington,  whichever is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, without further notice.  All interested parties must submit in writing the following:   name; address; point of contact; telephone number; business size and a brief statement regarding it's capability to provide the specified research and the names; telephone numbers; and points of contact for businesses or other Government agencies to which it has previously provided similar research.   No response will be provided to those inquiries which fail to provide the information requested.  This information should be faxed to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Clisso.  A determination by the Government not to compete this  requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541710.  The small business standard is 500 employees.  This is not a small-business set-aside.  The research will be purchased under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.
