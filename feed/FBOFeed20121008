<CONTACT>Lynn  Hollfelder, Subcontract Staff Specialist, Phone 7169424789, Fax 7169422031, Email lynn.hollfelder@chbwv.com
<DESC>Three Radioactive Class 7 waste packages currently stored at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) (West Valley, New York) are required to be shipped offsite for final dispositioning. Final dispositioning alternatives include:
<p>&bull; National Nuclear Security Site (NNSS) in Mercury, Nevada; and <br />&bull; Waste Control Specialists (WCS) in Andrews, Texas.</p>
<p>This request solicits technical DOT shipping/rail loading expertise to evaluate the transportation of the three Radioactive Class 7 packages to both NNSS and WCS and identify a preferred site based on transportation costs; and to develop associated draft Offsite Transportation Emergency Plans. The three waste packages are:</p>
<p>&bull; Vitrification Melter <br />o Approximate Weight: 180 tons <br />o Approximate Dimensions: 13' x 13' x 13'H<br />o Approximate Maximum Contact Dose Rate: 75 mR/hr<br />o Radiological Class: C<br /><br />&bull; Vitrification Concentrator Feed Makeup Tank (CFMT)<br />o Approximate Weight: 150 tons <br />o Approximate Dimensions: 14' x 13' x 19'H <br />o Approximate Maximum Contact Dose Rate: 165 mR/hr<br />o Radiological Class: C<br /><br />&bull; Vitrification Makeup Feed Holding Tank (MFHT)<br />o Approximate Weight: 140 tons<br />o Approximate Dimensions: 14' x 13' x 16'H <br />o Approximate Maximum Contact Dose Rate: 41 mR/hr<br />o Radiological Class: C<br /><br />Tasks to be completed by the subcontractor include:<br /><br />1. Development of an approved route and cost estimate for shipping the three waste packages by rail from the WVDP to NNSS and WCS.</p>
<p>2. Completion of a Rail Clearance evaluation from the WVDP to the both NNSS and WCS to determine if one or both of the candidate disposal sites are indeed currently (at time of subcontract award for this SOW) accessible by rail.</p>
<p>3. For the NNSS alternative, identification of transload facility(s) and the completion of a Road Clearance evaluation from transload facility(s) to NNSS.</p>
<p>4. Identification of needed rail and/or road permits.</p>
<p>5. Identification of load securing requirements and specifications for handling and rigging equipment for rail and truck</p>
<p>6. Development of a draft Offsite Transportation Emergency Plan for both alternatives (NNSS and WCS). (CHBWV can supply a previous draft from 2004 for an example)</p>
<p>7. Completion of a Cost-Benefit Analysis to identify the preferred disposal site based on transportation cost inclusive of, but not limited to, costs associated with actual transportation, permits, load handling and securing, and finalization and implementation of Offsite Transportation Emergency Plan.</p>
<p>8. Development of schedule to complete the above tasks and submit final work products to CHBWV.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<p>The award of the subcontract to perform the above scope is targeted to be completed by end of Calendar Year (CY) 2012. Although a schedule is being requested, it is anticipated the subcontractor will be able to complete required tasks within six months of contract award. The actual shipment of the packages is dependent on funding but may occur as early as CY 2013 and as late as CY2016.</p>
<p>Interested parties are required to submit supporting documentation demonstrating your company has a minimum of three (3) years of proven experience of similar complexity and magnitude.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The 380th Contracting Squadron intends to award competitively a contract for washer/dryer maintenance services at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates. The contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, transportation, and labor necessary to maintain and repair United States Air Force owned washers and dryers at Al Dhafra AB. The Contractor shall perform in accordance with standards outlined in the Performance Work Statement. A Firm-Fixed Price contract will result from this posting, with period of performance to commence on 15 November 2012. The performance period of this contract shall consist of a base year plus 4 option years. There is no guarantee that options will be exercised. The anticipated award date for this acquisition is 26 Oct 2012.<br /><br />The offeror shall provide a proposal in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement and solicitation, FA5706-12-T-0007. The proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2 "Evaluation of Commercial Items" located in the solicitation. Award shall be made to the lowest priced offeror that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The proposal shall include the proposed pricing for CLINs 0001 through 0010 in United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), which includes the base year and four option years. The Government requires interested parties to send the attached Past Performance Questionnaire to at least two (2) clients who have received the same or similar service. Only projects that have occurred within the previous three (3) years from the issuance of this solicitation shall be considered valid. Information should be provided detailing to which customers the contractor sent the Past Performance Questionnaire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Initially, proposals will be ranked according to price. Once the proposals are organized based upon price, the evaluation will commence, starting with the lowest priced proposal. If the lowest priced proposal meets all the evaluation criteria as outlined in&nbsp;FAR&nbsp;Clause 52.212-2&nbsp;of the solicitation, award shall be made to that contractor. If the lowest priced proposal is deemed unacceptable, the Government will review the next lowest priced proposal. The evaluation process will continue until a proposal meets the requirements outlined in&nbsp;FAR Clause 52.212-2&nbsp;of the solicitation. <br /><br />It is the Government's intention to award without discussions. If, however, at any time during the evaluation process the contracting officer deems discussions to be in the best interest of the Government, a competitive range will be established IAW FAR 15.306. The contracting office may determine that the number of proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If this occurs, discussions will be held with those offerors within the competitive range, and those outside of the range will be eliminated from consideration for award.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. POC: SFC Jason Zahnley @ 760-380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

The American Standard practice for the inspection of elevators, inspector's manual, a17.s-1979, or latest edition and the American National Standard Safety Code for elevators, dumbwaiters, escalators and moving walks - ANSI A17.11978 or latest edition, will be used by the inspector as a guide in inspections.  
    
The inspections shall be thorough and cover all items as specified, as well as any other parts and assemblies not listed thereunder, in order to make a proper inspection.  Parts shall be removed, where necessary, determine the exact condition of parts which could not otherwise be determined, and the equipment shall be cleaned (where necessary) to make inspection. 
    
A minor and a major inspection will be completed by a qualified licensed elevator inspector.

The major inspection will consist of all above items plus act as a witness for the annual safety testing of all units.  

Upon completion of inspections and within then (10) business days after each inspection, a written report of inspection will be provided to the Chief of Engineering Service notifying the Department of Veterans Affairs of any discrepancies.  Any unsafe conditions encountered during the inspections will be reported immediately to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or designee.
