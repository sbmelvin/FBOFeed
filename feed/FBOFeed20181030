<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3556. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The 366th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program at Mountain Home AFB, ID to include Gowen Field in Boise, ID. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.</p>
<p>A MACC is an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract that is awarded to multiple vendors. A determination for set-aside has not been determined. Small Businesses, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged and Women Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to complete the attached questionnaire to assist the Small Business Specialist in the acquisition set-aside determination and under the assigned NAICS codes 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million. The envisioned MACC program would consist of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure, performed under a design/build or bid/build process. In general, MACC program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under MACC. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (http://www.sam.gov/).</p>
<p>The information received by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agencies. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that contracts will be awarded for a term consisting of one (1)-five (5) year ordering period. Task Orders written against MACC contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $5,000,000. The overall program value is estimated at $90 million over a five-year period.</p>
<p>If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement to Kevin Kirkendall via mail addressed to 366 CONS/PKB, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Ste. 498, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648, or email (preferred method) to kevin.kirkendall.3@us.af.mil and matthew.daub@us.af.mil, not later than 4:30 PM MST, 30 November 2018. If emailing your response, please note that due to increased firewall protections some emails may be blocked; therefore, follow-up via telephone (if an acknowledgement is not received back via email by 12:00 PM MST, 30 November 2018) is recommended to ensure receipt of your submission by the Government.</p>

Before consulting the Ombudsman, concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues and disagreements, and/or recommendation to the listed Contracting Officer above for resolution. The AFLCMC/XZC Ombudsman, located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH serves as the Ombudsman for all of AFLCMC, including its GSUs. The Ombudsman hears concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, communicates those concerns from industry or Government personnel, and assists in the resolution of those concerns. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query, the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry.

The DASR system detects aircraft position and weather conditions in the vicinity of civilian and military airfields, and it is a key component of the National Airspace System (NAS) modernization. The FAA nomenclature for DASR is the ASR-11, and the DoD nomenclature for DASR is AN/GPN-30; henceforth referred to as ASR-11. The ASR-11 improves reliability, provides additional weather data, reduces maintenance cost, improves performance, and provides digital data to new digital automation systems for presentation on air traffic controller displays. The ASR-11 consists of a primary surveillance radar and a secondary surveillance radar, as well as an antenna tower; an electronic equipment shelter/building with heating, ventilation and air conditioning; a power distribution system; an uninterruptible power supply; a back-up emergency engine/generator set; fire detection; security; and data communications equipment to connect the radar to the local radar approach control center.</p>

<DESC>Parachutist Flotation Device (PFD)<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought / Request for Information (RFI) and an Industry Day (ID) announcement on behalf of Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) to discuss the future US Army's requirement for a flotation device for intentional and unintentional water landing during airborne operations. A capability gap resides within the current legacy parachutist flotation systems. The B-7, LPU-10, and Tactical Flotation Support System (TFSS) life preservers currently do not meet all of the Army's requirements, or are no longer available for intentional, and/or unintentional parachutist water entry. The Parachutist Flotation Device (PFD) will support airborne operations over water or during airdrops when water obstacles are near or on the intended drop zone. Natick Contracting Division (NCD) and PM-SCIE are conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 in advance of a potential solicitation for development of the PFD.<br />This is a Sources Sought / RFI and an Industry Day announcement only. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. There are no bid packages or solicitations available with this announcement. This announcement does not constitute a procurement commitment by the US Government. No contract will be awarded from this request. Responses to this announcement are voluntary. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information to this announcement. The Government is not liable for any damages associated with improperly identified information.<br /><br />Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) of personal flotation equipment, personnel parachute systems, and flotation/parachute accessories are invited to submit a capability statement describing their experience in this field to the POCs identified in this announcement. PM-SCIE representatives, and military force modernization equipment subject matter experts will be in attendance to discuss capabilities and requirements.
<p>Industry Day Information:<br />The US Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCOE) in conjunction with PM-SCIE are investigating the ability of industry to meet performance, maintainability, and compatibility requirements of PFD.

NAICS Code:  			237310 Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction
Small Business Size Standard:  	$36.5 Million
Product and Service Code (PSC): Y1LB Construction of Highways, roads, streets, bridges, and railways


GENERAL INFORMATION:

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price for the construction of new bridges within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The following is a brief description of each bridge:

Base Bid Item - Pump House Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located east of Gaston in rural unincorporated Washington County, Oregon. The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden pump house bridge and the construction of the new Pump House Bridge (steel girder bridge) approximately 145 feet to the west of the existing bridge. The new bridge will consist of a 20-foot-wide, 91-foot long steel bridge with curb-mounted guardrails on either side supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the new bridge north to SW Gaston Road and a gravel levee access road connecting the new bridge easterly toward the existing pump house.  Access roads will include riprap slope protection and the installation of an access control gate north of the new bridge.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.
 
Optional Bid Item - Gaston Pedestrian Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located in south of Gaston (adjacent to the Gaston Feed Store), in rural unincorporated Washington and Yamhill Counties, Oregon.  The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden bridge and the construction of the new Gaston Pedestrian Bridge in the same location as the existing bridge. The existing bridge once provided pedestrians and vehicles access to the Refuge but currently it no longer provides a safe crossing. The new bridge will consist of an 8-foot-wide, 85-foot-long aluminum truss pedestrian bridge supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the existing dirt access road to the new bridge, and the existing levee will receive a new gravel access to account for the difference in elevations between the new bridge and the existing levee.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.

CAPABILITIES:

Firms shall demonstrate the following:

1. Experience:  At a minimum, firms shall provide the following information for the new bridge construction work. Firms shall provide no more than five (5) projects.  Each project shall have a final contract value greater than $1,000,000 and shall have been completed within the past five (5) years or be currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: Economic Staff Support<br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY
<p>NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION</p>
<p>The Economics Staff of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Planning (OPl) has a requirement to provide accurate and timely economic assessments of FDA regulatory actions.  These analyses have high public visibility and, therefore, must withstand intense scientific and technical review and scrutiny by diverse audiences including the public, regulated entities, Government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Congress, professional economists, and the scientific and medical community.  The need of the Economics Staff for support by a contractor arises from the variety and complexity of the work, the need to have access to specialized resources to rapidly gather data to meet tight deadlines, and the need for research involving direct contact with regulated entities.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking sources capable of performing work on the following activities:</p>
<p>Methods - While the economic impact of certain FDA regulatory actions can be analyzed via established methods, other FDA initiatives will require novel analytical approaches to evaluate potential effects. For example, estimating the societal effects of initiatives to modernize FDA's regulatory oversight of product safety and efficacy may require innovative approaches to collect or generate data, such as Internet panels, laboratory or field experiments, expert elicitations, contingent valuation, and data-based simulations.</p>
<p>Baseline Measurement - The FDA needs data on the economic characteristics of regulated industries, so that changes in regulatory policies can be empirically examined. This data will include, for example, the number, size, and location (domestic or foreign) of firms and their employment, sales, and number of stock keeping units (labels). In some instances, industry profile studies require supporting documentation for OMB survey clearance procedures.</p>
<p>Estimating Effects of Potential Regulatory Actions. The agency's planned regulatory agenda includes numerous potential regulations that would have economic consequences. The FDA requires data and models that can be used to estimate the effects likely to be associated with many different policies and provisions that could become regulations. These effects include the distribution of behavioral changes of consumers and producers in response to potential agency actions and the changes in risk that would result.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice to determine the availability of Small Businesses capable of supplying the required supply item/services. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation or an indication the Government will award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p><br />Capabilities Required:<br />To be determined as a potentially capable source for this requirement, responses to this notice shall outline the firm's capability to perform the following work:</p>
<p>A.	Analyses and Evaluations:</p>
<p>1.	Conduct baseline assessment of industry characteristics, including, but not limited to, estimating employment levels, profits, prices, competitive structure, domestic and foreign location, and industry practices (or performance), including all international effects. The baseline should include projected changes over time.</p>
<p>2.	Develop methods and collect data to estimate the economic costs of existing or potential regulatory actions. FDA regulations may alter the expected use of a product, as well as result in higher costs of manufacture or distribution. Each component of these costs shall be identified, defined, and quantified, with all data compiled and sorted to facilitate statistical analyses.</p>
<p>3.	Develop methods and collect data to estimate the reduction in risk attributable to existing or potential regulatory actions and assess any potentially offsetting increases in risk.</p>
<p>4.	Develop methods and measures of the effects of regulations and other exogenous factors on innovation and productivity. R&amp;D and future innovation may be either encouraged or hindered by regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>5.	Develop methods and measures of the effects on the competitive vitality of small business in accordance with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Many of the firms FDA regulates are small. Record keeping and reporting requirements, for example, may impose disproportionate effects on smaller businesses, because fixed costs are spread over a smaller sales base. FDA is required by law to take these effects into account and to grant regulatory relief, where possible, to small firms.</p>
<p>6.	Develop adaptable methods and databases that can cover various regulatory alternatives. Many new options to meet stated objectives arise during regulation development. A critical task is to develop general methods and databases that can be applied to assess the effects of these options as they are proposed or considered.</p>
<p>7.	Develop methods and empirical measures for a section in regulatory analyses in which FDA states prospectively how it will measure the effectiveness of regulations over time.  These measures will meet the need for retrospective reviews.</p>
<p>B.	Areas of Analyses:  <br /> <br />The following list illustrates the kind of economic research that will be requested. The contractor shall demonstrate the ability to conduct analyses for both quick response and long range studies.</p>
<p>1.	FDA may implement new initiatives to strengthen the review of medical products throughout their life-cycle, to reduce medical product errors and to further protect the safety or integrity of food, human and veterinary drug products, biological products and medical and radiation emitting devices.  Evaluating these actions may require surveying the industry (including domestic and foreign producers) to describe baseline conditions, collecting baseline risk information, assessing the potential of various interventions to reduce risk, and assessing the potential of various interventions to have unintended consequences that increase risks.</p>
<p>2.	FDA regulates many retail products. To better assess baseline conditions in the markets for these products, FDA may need data on the number of products in one or more of these categories, including OTC drugs, retail medical devices, and traditional and non-traditional tobacco products.</p>
<p>3.	FDA is interested in assessing the validity of the growing number of cost effectiveness analyses prepared by pharmaceutical companies. The contractor would assist in the development of appropriate methodologies.</p>
<p>4.	FDA is interested in assessing the effects of requiring informational or warning labels on consumer labeling. The contractor would assess the behavioral responses of consumers and domestic and foreign industry to different proposed labels for the different product categories regulated by FDA.</p>
<p>5.	The products and components of many products regulated by FDA are imported. FDA regulations apply equally to imported and domestically manufactured or processed goods. The behavioral responses of foreign firms to FDA regulations, however, may differ greatly from the responses of domestic firms. The contractor would design a model that would incorporate FDA data on foreign firms while predicting the response of foreign firms and imports to regulations that increase costs of production. The contractor would illustrate and validate the model for an existing FDA-regulated product or products.</p>
<p>6.	Medical scientists are developing more sophisticated tools and novel technologies that might be used to produce or evaluate FDA regulated products. Such technologies include using pharmacogenomics in drug discovery and development or using advances in biotechnology to develop medical products.  The contractor would assist in evaluating the costs and risks associated with regulating novel technologies.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>The Other Transaction Authority (OTA), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to "carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be carried out by the DoD, or to improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces." Constant innovation and rapid technology advances are occurring throughout the world. Partnerships with commercial industry, the civil maritime sector, and others will be used to leverage these approaches and increase flexibility and agility, reduce cost, improve technology and capability insertion, and decrease program development cycles. The OTA offers an alternative to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&#8208;based acquisitions, allowing for access to participation by non-traditional defense contractors with innovative solutions that may not normally desire to participate in government procurement.</p>

  2. The contractor shall protect, safeguard, control, manage and destroy VA designated confidential documents complying with VA Directive 6371, dated April 8, 2014 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-88 (NISTSP 800-88) Guidelines for Media Sanitization and FIPS 199 Security Categorization of the System Confidentiality.

All loads leaving the VA facilities must be secured and sealed before transportation. All VA material arriving at the contractor destruction facility must be shredded material. The contractor will retain risk of loss from pickup through destruction.  

C.  DESCRIPTION OF CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT DISPOSAL CONTAINERS:

1.  The Government (VA) may utilize several different types of locked document disposal containers.  Containers shall be Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) owned and provided by the contractor.  Pricing for such containers shall be included in the disposal prices.  Containers shall be lockable, lock with a key or lock combination provided to the designated COR.

All containers must comply with Life Safety Code: NFPA 101-2000) 19.7.5.5., for use in non-hazardous areas.

2.  The VA shall retain flexibility to increase or decrease the size or the number of containers without incurring any additional costs.  The costs for each container shall be based on established pricing.

4. The Government reserves the right to order additional containers on a surge basis as required for unforeseen situations such as office relocations, file closeouts, etc.

5.  Bins will be top loaded and have a build in lock to ensure waste deposited cannot be removed without a key.  A key to each bin will be provided to the VA facility COR.

The pickup schedule and container placement will be reviewed initially on a  week by week  basis for a ten (10) week period (by contractor and VA COR) and then on an as-needed basis to adjust the minimum/maximum usage of the containers.

 7.  Pickup of the secure waste shall take place during normal working hours, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.   4:30 p.m. or during normal working hours for the designated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC).

D.  TASKS:

 1.  To support the contract, the contractor shall perform tasks described below.  The contractor shall work closely with designated COR s.

 (a)  Task 1: Pick up, secure, transport, temporarily store, and handle designated materials (including paper documents) in compliance with VA Directive 6371, NIST 800-88 and FIPS regulations.  The contractor must maintain a chain of security from pick up to final destruction by one of the acceptable manners as listed in Task 2.  At a minimum, basic shredding shall be done on site. Interim destruction of temporary paper records requires macerating, chopping, pulverizing, or shredding of these records to a degree that does not definitively ensure that they are not readable or reconstructable to any degree, but does ensure that they are not readable or reconstructable without extraordinary effort.  This destruction of temporary records is a preliminary step

 (b)  Task 2: The contractor shall destroy (renders unrecognizable) all VA designated documents.  Contractor shall render VA designated materials unrecognizable by one of the following VA approved destruction techniques:

   (1)  Destroy paper using shredders which produce particles that are 1 x 5 millimeters in size (reference devices on the NSA paper shredder EPL), or  

   (2)  To pulverize/disintegrate paper materials using disintegrator devices equipment with a 3/32 inch security screen (reference NSA Disintegrator EPL). OR

  (3)  Pulp materials in accordance with stipulated NIST and FIPS regulations.

Note:  If shredding is not the final destruction method and shredding is only an interim step in the destruction process, then shredding to NIST standards is not required, but the shredded material must be protected until it is no longer readable or reconstructable which means material must be pulverized, bleached, pulped or fully destroyed by other means.  

 2.  Contractor is ultimately responsible for document security from pickup at VA through final destruction.  Contractor shall transport by secure means and safeguard designated destruction materials at all times and in all locations from pickup through certified destruction.

  3.  Contractor shall deliver industry standard Certificates of Destruction for completed destruction according to NIST and FIPS Regulations.

    4.  Contractor shall coordinate pick up schedule for assigned locations with the COR.  

E.  NON-DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION

1.  Contractor staff involved in this contract will have access to some privileged and confidential materials of the US Government.

The contractor agrees to safeguard these privileges and use the information exclusively in the performance of this contract.  The contractor shall comply with applicable Government regulations regarding information document security to prevent disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals or organizations.


F.  CERTIFICATION OF DESTRUCTION:  

The contractor shall prepare and submit to the medical facility s COR an original signed Certificate of Destruction for each pick up for each site.

The destruction of the information must be witnessed either by a Federal employee or, if authorized by the organization that created the records, by a contractor employee. This witnessing may be completed by the wastepaper contractor as long as a documented certification of destruction is provided to VA that certifies complete destruction of the records.

The vendor will provide the facility with documented evidence of the amount and date the material was collected prior to transporting off-site.


G.  CONTRACTOR VEHICLES:  All contractor vehicles utilized in this contract shall be insured (up to the minimum coverage required by the State in which the VA facility is located) and maintain current state vehicle registration.

<DESC><strong>CONTRACT NUMBER: FA4610-13-D-0010<br />DESCRIPTION: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE<br /></strong><br />The 30th Contracting Squadron (30 CONS) at Vandenberg AFB, CA intends to extend the existing Packing, Containerization &amp; Local Drayage of Direct Procurement Method (DPM) Personal Property Shipments (Packing &amp; Crating Services), on a sole-source basis, from 01 December 2018 through 31 March 2019, to Andersen Van &amp; Storage, Inc. (AFFARS 5313.501 - 10 U.S.C. 2302b, Implementation of Simplified Acquisition Procedures (41 U.S.C. 1901) to award on a sole-source basis). The Government contemplates the proposed extension to consist of one (1) four (4) month option award for the period of 01 December 2018 through 31 March 2019.<br /><br />Andersen Van &amp; Storage Inc. currently performs requirements for Packing &amp; Crating Services under contract FA4610-13-D-0010. 30 CONS is working to award a new Packing &amp; Crating Services requirement and competitive acquisition is currently underway. A solicitation for the new requirement will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or around November 2018. It is anticipated an award will be made during the January/February 2019 timeframe or sooner.<br /><br />The requirement is for Packing, Containerization and Local Drayage of Direct Procurement Method (DPM) Personal Property Shipments for the JPPSO-NC and 30 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) at Vandenberg AFB, California. The services include pre-move survey, servicing of appliances, disassembly of furniture, packaging, inventorying, tagging, wrapping, padding, and packing of household goods in government-owned and furnished shipping containers at member's/employees' residence. Services also include properly securing and sealing for shipment, weighing, obliterating old markings, marking, strapping, and drayage of the container within the area of performance. Work to be performed includes services for Schedule I - Outbound Services, Schedule II - Inbound Services, and Schedule III - Intra-City and Intra-Area Moves. The area of responsibility includes San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, California.<br /><br />The loss of Packing &amp; Crating Services poses an immediate risk due to impact on mission support operations. Failure to provide this support would seriously impact personal property shipments in conjunction with personnel assignments inbound, outbound, and around the Vandenberg AFB area of responsibility. The time it would take for a new contractor to get on board to perform these same services would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition. Additionally, it would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements as a result of the potential break in service thereby negatively impacting the Vandenberg AFB mission. <br /><br />Andersen Van &amp; Storage Inc. currently holds all required certifications and clearances required to perform required services; is familiar with established processes and procedures; and is otherwise eligible for contract award under all applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, 30 CONS intends to execute this action as a sole-source award to Andersen Van &amp; Storage, Inc. which is the only company capable of adequately providing Packing &amp; Crating Services to Vandenberg AFB in a timely manner, without a break in service, and with minimum impact to mission support operations.<br /><br />The closing date and time for any responses to this proposed contract action is 15 November 2018 at 4:00 PM PST. Written responses to this notice of intent shall be sent to the attention of Lucille Ngiraswei, Contracting Officer, at lucille.ngiraswei.2@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The government seeks variety of reliable and easily implementable solutions for safe and affordable transportation across the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL).
<p>On November 28th, 2018 at 9AM, the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) will host a Transportation Suite (TS) Initiative Industry Day at the JB MDL Tommy B's Community Activity Center located at 2705 East Arnold Avenue, Trenton, NJ. On the afternoon of November 28th, the TS Industry Day Feedback Sprint will commence. The event will continue through 4PM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has a population of about 48,000 people, including families with children and newly enlisted. Public Transportation in the area surrounding JB MDL is minimal, except for local taxi service. There is only one NJ Transit bus terminal located on Wrightstown-Pemberton Rd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A personal vehicle is currently necessary for working, shopping or medical appointments on or off the base, as well as getting to the base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JB MDL Transportation Suite (TS) initiative aims to strengthen cultural, functional, and environmental aspects of the everyday living experience, by offering JB MDL community reliable and multi-modal methods of transportation across the base. Proposed solutions shall be fully operational, with reliable schedules and/or availability, be compliant with all federal, state and county safety and transportation regulations, and with minimal or no-cost cost implementation. Please note, recurring access to the base will require active security clearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to JB MDL transportation, government will consider solutions addressing "to/from" commuter services between the base and surrounding communities, as well as hourly services between McGuire, Fort Dix and Lakehurst visitor centers. Suggested solutions can address either all or one requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TS Industry Feedback Sprint will consist of multiple Industry-led working groups analyzing and discussing the TS requirement via non-Government, third party facilitation. This is an exceptional opportunity for Industry experts to help shape a critical component of the JB MDL Transportation Suite Initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When: Wednesday, 28 November 2018 from 0900 -1600. Showtime is 0815 at Visitors Center</p>
<p>Where: Meet at the McGuire Visitor Center, 3021 McGuire Blvd, JB MDL 08641</p>

(Bethesda, MD) for the purpose of procuring breaching equipment. The FBI has a requirement for two (2) SAN Hydraulic Breaching Tool Kits and associated accessories in order to maintain tactical breaching responsibility and posture.
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the Government and related industry, it has been determined that Mistral Security, Inc. is currently the only source of supply to the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and civilian law enforcement agencies for the SAN Hydraulic Breaching Tool Kit; therefore, they are the only company capable of providing the equipment that will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 335999 - All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

Responses sent via other means (i.e. via telephone call, facsimile transmission, etc.) will not be considered. Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012, to receive government contracts. The FBI utilizes a financial system that has a direct interface with the SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes: TIN, EFT, DUNs, addresses, and contact information.

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director (OD), Office of Extramural Research (OER), Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS) has a requirement to identify and test an Advanced Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence platform for categorization of scientific projects.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the NIH/OD/OER/ORIS to identify and test a platform that uses advanced natural language processing to read descriptions of scientific projects and categorize the projects as Alzheimer's and/or one of 15 other disease, condition, or research categories. The results of the test will be compared against the current NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system (https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx; https://report.nih.gov/rcdc/index.aspx), by analyzing the results of the identification and categorization of projects to Alzheimer's and 15 other disease, condition, or research categories. <br />Background:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Extramural Research (OER), provides the corporate framework for research administration, ensuring scientific integrity, public accountability, and effective stewardship of the NIH extramural research portfolio. OER develops and maintains research portfolio reporting databases and analysis tools on behalf of the NIH, as listed at https://RePORT.nih.gov. These tools are intended to improve NIH-wide internal staff and public access to data on NIH research and management activities to allow staff to evaluate and manage research portfolios as well as to satisfy certain reporting requirements of the NIH Reform Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-482; H.R. 6164, &sect;402B). These tools integrate new and existing data sources to allow user-defined querying, reporting, analysis, evaluation, and visualization of NIH grants, intramural projects, contracts, and associated outputs. An additional purpose is to develop and maintain similar tools to support other offices within NIH and other federal science agencies. <br /><br />Information Requested:</p>
<p>The NIH/OER, Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS), is seeking to identify and test an artificial intelligence platform against the current NIH RCDC system by comparing the results of identification and categorization of 3 years of NIH sponsored projects to categories of Alzheimer's and 15 other disease, condition, or research categories.</p>
<p><br />The NIH/OER/ORIS, is requesting information from offerors that:</p>
<p>a. Propose an easy to use system that employs advanced natural language processing algorithms and artificial intelligence to categorize 3 years of NIH projects to categories of Alzheimer's and 15 other disease, condition, or research categories.</p>
<p>b. The categories to be tested are:<br />1. Alzheimer's Disease<br />2. Frontotemporal Dementia <br />3. Pick's Disease<br />4. Dementia<br />5. Lewy Body Dementia<br />6.

Hodgkin's Disease American Indians/Alaska Natives<br />14. Breast Cancer<br />15. Ovarian Cancer<br />16. Tuberculosis</p>
<p>c. The platform may be installed locally at NIH or in the cloud but must conform to NIST security requirements for moderately sensitive data.</p>
<p>d. Allows the NIH to actively participate in the test via hands on use of the system including training, category development and validation.</p>
<p>e. Once the test is complete, provide a written report on the project including categorization results and comparisons to existing categorical results (e.g. 1) How the system being tested determines the projects relevant to the category, 2) why the system being tested produces better or worse results, 3) how the tested technology differs from the existing technology, etc.)</p>
<p>f. Once the test is complete, provide a breakdown of the costs for the test and an estimate of the costs needed to license, install and implement your product for NIH categorization in its entirety.</p>
<p>g. Propose an estimated cost for this test and reports over the 6 month period of performance.</p>
<p><br />All responses will be evaluated on their ability to handle each of the following specified requirements for the platform:</p>
<p>1. Utilizes advanced natural language process to "read" the documents (e.g. to identify scientific intent, recognize negation, recognize abbreviations, recognize strings and coordination, etc)<br />2. Uses artificial intelligence to categorize the scientific projects. <br />3. Ease of training of the AI platform (Gold standard sets will be available to train the platform.)<br />4. Previous experience in machine reading and categorization.<br />5.

<p>52.212-2 Addenda: <br />1.0 Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government's selection for an awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The purchase order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable.</p>
<p>2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach<br />All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the purchase order. <br /><br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award based on initial proposals. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the purchase order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>a. Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>i. The contractor shall meet the following military standards and/or industry standard for the listed materials:<br />a. ARMOR, ALUMINUM, 5086-H32<br />b. ARMOR, ALUMINUM, 5086-H111 <br />c. ARMOR, ALUMINUM, 5052-H32</p>
<p>ii. The Contractor shall deliver materials within the delivery schedule specified in the Statement of Work or best delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated to determine an offeror's Understanding of the Requirements and Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p>(1) Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved including offeror's existing capabilities, knowledge and expertise in providing the requested items and meeting the requirements presented by the SOW.</p>
<p>(2) Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the SOW requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION<br />ACCEPTABLE Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be scored.</p>
<p>2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award. Unit pricing shall be listed with extended costs for each item.</p>
<p>3. Adequate competition is anticipated for this purchase order. However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c). Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received and the quote is $700,000 or more, the Contracting Officer shall obtain Certified Cost or Pricing Data. Offers under $700,000.00 require cost or pricing data, but such cost or pricing data is not required to be certified by the offeror. Cost or Pricing Data or Other than certified cost or pricing data shall be provided upon request IAW FAR 15.403. This information will be evaluated for magnitude and reasonableness and may be adjusted from a technical and cost perspective using cost analysis to determine the most probable cost to the Government.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Syringes. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Syringes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Syringes in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Syringes will be established approximately February 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately March 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Syringes. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Syringes. <br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Syringes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,329,109. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eleven items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% ($1,329,109) of the total volume in sales ($1,329,109). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.

“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

“Registered in the SAM database” means that—

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.<BR><BR>“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—

  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;

  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.


  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:

    (i)  Company legal business name.

    (v)  Company telephone number.

    (vi)  Date the company was started.

    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d)  Reserved.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<BR><BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—

      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(End of Clause)<BR><BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(c)
(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to—
(A) Change the name in the SAM database;

The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished.
(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.<BR><BR>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<BR><BR>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.<BR><BR>(f) Excusable delays.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor’s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either—
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor’s EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor’s EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for—
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor’s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and—

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor’s financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing.

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor’s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 33.106, insert the following provision:

This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor’s network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor’s ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (2)  Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents.

Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(e)  Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
 
      (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.
 
      (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
 
      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD—
 
            (1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;
 
            (2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;
 
            (3)  To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;
 
            (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
 
            (5)  To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
 
      (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD.

      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor’s responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shall—
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and
 
            (2)  Require subcontractors to—
 
                    (i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and
 
                    (ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.<BR><BR>(a)Definitions.

<p><br />C-1 DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>The Standfordville East Timber Sale is planned to be implemented as an Integrated Resource Timber Contract with embedded service work projects.    This cruise plan includes an estimated 350 +/- acres of thinning intended to move project area stands from their current overstocked condition towards the desired condition for RCW habitat.  Individual cut tree marking (CTM) is planned for 310 +/- acres in eight (8) units.  These areas will receive a 100% tally with sample trees using the Sample Tree (STR) cruise method.  Individual leave tree marking (LTM) is planned for 40 +/- acres in two (2) units and will be prism cruised and sampled using the point count measure (PCM) cruise method.</p>
<p>The Contractor's personnel assigned cruising duties shall be qualified cruisers meeting Region 8 Forest Service standards.  This qualification process generally takes two days.  One day to work through a self-study guide followed by a written test and one day to field measure a set of trees and then to compare them against predetermined measurements for those same trees.</p>
<p>If Contractor's personnel have been previously certified as Region 8 Forest Service Qualified Cruisers, such documentation must be provided to the Forest Service.  In such cases, individuals will only need to complete the field measurements test prior to starting work.</p>

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE (RMW) SERVICES

GENERAL
Contractor shall provide complete removal, disposal and transportation of all Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) Services for the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS).  The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, tools and equipment necessary to perform the task in accordance with the schedule and to comply with all guidelines established by Federal, State and local laws and ordinances.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines RMW as "any solid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals."  This may include any waste material or article which harbors, or may reasonably be considered to harbor, pathogens which might be expected to produce disease in healthy individuals.  Medical waste subject to these requirements includes waste that generally has been considered infectious or potentially infectious by the health care community, as well as waste originating from health care or research facilities that are aesthetically objectionable and thus, problematic when disposed of improperly.  "Trace" chemotherapeutic waste shall be included in the scope of this contract. "Bulk" chemotherapeutic waste shall be managed as hazardous waste within the generating facility and disposed of through a separate contract.
NEW RECYCLING EFFORTS
One of TVHS s top priorities is the minimization of waste to include significant efforts in recycling and waste diversion.  The requested services will render all RMW, chemotherapeutic and pathological waste non-recognizable and non-infectious.  It is preferable that resulting waste be sent in whole or in part for disposal as fuel in electrical co-generation, incinerated, and/or as much of the waste be recycled as possible (e.g. plastic, metal, etc.).  
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE (RMW) REQUIREMENTS
Contractor to provide collection containers that are reusable, sealable, leak proof and puncture resistant with secure lids that can be used at point-of-generation collections/stations throughout TVHS facilities.  In FY16, TVHS generated approximately 343,000 pounds of medical waste at the Nashville Campus and 82,000 pounds of medical waste at the Alvin C. York Campus in Murfreesboro.  The weight of waste at outpatient clinics is nominal.
The contractor shall adhere to the following regulations. Regulations stated should only be used as a guide and are not intended to be all-inclusive regulations that the contractor must comply with.
The contractor shall submit all state department and public reports as required.
Pursuant to codes of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), Division of Solid Waste Management.
The contractor must comply with executive order 13101 (SEPTEMBER 14, 1998) GREENING THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH WASTE PREVENTION, RECYCLING AND FEDERAL ACQUISITION.
The contractor shall utilize an on-line manifest system to log receipt for materials and certify proper disposal and that is compatible with current VA computer systems. The contractor will submit the proposed manifest system forms for VA approval. After approval of the online system and award of the contract, the Contractor will furnish login information to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to access the online manifest system.  The contractor will leave one copy of the manifest with the COR at the time of the pick-up showing the quantity picked up. The completed manifests will be returned within Thirty (30) calendar days to the COR. Manifest shall contain at minimum the signature, address and contact information of (1) generator, (2) transporter and (3) final destruction/disposal representative.
Plant must comply with the Clean Air Act of 1991 and produce only safe neutral by-products and the vendor must be able to show compliance with all environmental applicable state and county regulations.
The COR or designee will verify weights/counts of materials being picked up. 
The contractor is responsible for notifying the COR or designee upon arrival and departure at all pick-up locations.
The following is a listing and description of the medical wastes that are, at a minimum, included in the scope of this contract:
Cultures and stocks: Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including: cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuated vaccines, and culture dishes and devices used to transfer inoculate and mix cultures.
Pathological Waste: Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs and body parts and body fluids that are removed during surgery or autopsy, or other medical procedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers. Animal tissues, body parts and carcasses are included in this category. Excluded in this category are tissue samples in paraffin.
Human blood and blood products: Liquid waste human blood and products of blood or items saturated and/or dripping with human blood, including serum, plasma and other blood components, and their containers, which were used or intended to be used in:
patient care (e.g. blood bags)
testing and laboratory analysis

For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:

The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but not for more than a total of six months during the life of the contract.  The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise.  This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.
QUOTE FORMAT AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03819QB2000010 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-101 effective 26 October 2018.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed requirements contract shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, and is the only OEM authorized distributor for F0210 parts required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607;	"Requirements - 70Z03819QB2000010"<br />&#61607;	"Terms and Conditions - 70Z03819QB2000010"</strong></p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p><strong>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. </strong></p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS, OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p><strong>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 20 November 2018 at 4:30 pm Eastern.</strong> Anticipated award date is on or about 31 January 2019.  Quotes and questions shall be submitted by email to Ty.B.DeHart@uscg.mil.  Please indicate solicitation 70Z03819QB2000010 in the subject line.  Phone calls WILL NOT be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p><strong>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.</strong> Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p><strong>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.</strong> Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Election of Forum</strong>. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</strong></p>

Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name or Equal Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G18Q9144 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-99-1 dated 15 June 2018. 
Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department s culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA

In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase Ophthalmic Perimeters to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers around the country. Ophthalmic Perimeters are designed to evaluate the sensitivity of discrete areas of the retina (visual field) through responses to light stimuli. These devices can determine the central and peripheral visual field and the areas of lost or depressed vision (scotomas). Perimeters are used to detect and evaluate abnormalities that cause constriction of the peripheral vision (e.g. retinitis pigmentosa) or that affect peripheral or central vision, or both. They also detect and evaluate abnormalities in the eye, optic nerve, or brain that cause constriction of the peripheral vision.
A single award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name or Equal equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein.  Quotes shall contain the terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand Name or Equal equipment.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. 
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing and the associated size standard is 1000 employees.  This procurement action is issued with 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. 
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Carl Zeiss® brand name or equal OPHTHALMIC PERIMETERS and related equipment and accessories as identified in ATTACHMENT A   OPHTHALMIC PERIMETERS - PRICE LIST.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in ATTACHMENT A   OPHTHALMIC PERIMETERS- PRICE LIST.  
The ordering period is for one year with two 12 month option years.  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities.   
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria as attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to provide additional description information and to extend the due date.&nbsp; 10/30/18.<br /><br /><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Additional Description:</span></strong>
<p style="mso-outline-level: 4">The Graco D60 system with the part number listed in the Parts is the whole paint sprayer equipment. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All the Graco accessories listed has to fit and work properly with this equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Hoses can be bought from other vendors. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Once the equipment arrives at the vendor distributor it has to be slightly modified in order to work with our application for transporting on board ship. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Due to our specific and unique specification of a Room Temperature Vulcanizing Rubber (RTV) Coating System, ordering the Graco (D-60) 36:1 represents the best value as prices will be based on our unique specifications from authorized retailers of the brand in a competitive environment. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Therefore, the price paid will represent the best value and result in the best cost alternative to meet the needs of NSWC PHD.</p>
<p>We have researched several vendors' models (e.g. as Binks and Graco).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Spray Pump Supply Unit that meets our specifications has to be custom made to our spraying specifications using the RTV coating system. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Binks models had a higher ratio (60:1) than 30:1 that did not meet our specifications.</p>
<p>The Air Assisted Graco Ram Mounted Pump Assembly Supply System is currently in use and is more than suitable for our applications. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This model includes training to the operators and also includes configuring the equipment to the customer needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The formulation for using Graco Air Assisted equipment for spraying RTV coating system is a US Navy proprietary information that is stated in the SW279-PRO-020/SPY-1B/D REVISION 02 Tech Manual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The parts/components are compatible with the existing equipment and the RTV Coating formulation does not have to be changed, retested and recertification by US Navy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DH 60 36: 1 is the Government's best choice for preventing unacceptable delays and unrecoverable cost to reformulate the RTV chemical formula.</p>

<p>(d)	The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e)	Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f)	If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>

<p>(i)	Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii)	Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(2)	For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i)	Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ``Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations'' (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(D)	If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk<br />and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.</p>
<p>(3)	Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)<br />of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.</p>
<p>(c)	Cyber incident reporting requirement.</p>
<p>(1)	When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(i)	Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and</p>
<p>(ii)	Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(2)	Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(3)	Medium assurance certificate requirement.

For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.</p>
<p>(d)	Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center<br />(DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e)	Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.</p>
<p>(f)	Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.</p>
<p>(g)	Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h)	DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent<br />practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.</p>
<p>(i)	Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD--</p>
<p>(1)	To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;</p>

<p>(5)	To a support services contractor (``recipient'') that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.</p>
<p>(j)	Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.</p>
<p>(k)	The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.</p>
<p>(l)	Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable<br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>(m)	Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p><br />(1)	Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The<br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(2)	Require subcontractors to--</p>
<p>(i)	Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(ii)	Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>

<p>(i)	Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A)	The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B)	The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C)	The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D)	The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><p>The 366th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program at Mountain Home AFB, ID to include Gowen Field in Boise, ID. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.</p>
<p>A MACC is an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract that is awarded to multiple vendors. A determination for set-aside has not been determined. Small Businesses, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged and Women Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to complete the attached questionnaire to assist the Small Business Specialist in the acquisition set-aside determination and under the assigned NAICS codes 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million. The envisioned MACC program would consist of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure, performed under a design/build or bid/build process. In general, MACC program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under MACC. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (http://www.sam.gov/).</p>
<p>The information received by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agencies. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that contracts will be awarded for a term consisting of one (1)-five (5) year ordering period. Task Orders written against MACC contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $5,000,000. The overall program value is estimated at $90 million over a five-year period.</p>
<p>If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement&nbsp;and completed questionnaire to Kevin Kirkendall via mail addressed to 366 CONS/PKB, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Ste. 498, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648, or email (preferred method) to kevin.kirkendall.3@us.af.mil and matthew.daub@us.af.mil, not later than 4:30 PM MST, 30 November 2018. If emailing your response, please note that due to increased firewall protections some emails may be blocked; therefore, follow-up via telephone (if an acknowledgement is not received back via email by 12:00 PM MST, 30 November 2018) is recommended to ensure receipt of your submission by the Government.</p>

<DESC>****Questions and Answers posted****<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.
<p>The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates an (competitive or noncompetitive) acquisition to provide:</p>
<p>The Case Management Control System (CMCS) is an Air Force information system that assists in the planning, execution, and management of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases. It provides management information, financial, administrative budget, and departmental financial support. CMCS is a legacy IT system developed based on FOCUS v. 7.6.13 that will continue to be maintained. This system operates on an IBM mainframe computer running on a z/OS operating system located in the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) at the Naval Inventory Control Point in Mechanicsburg, PA. The requirement is to provide modern, web-based analytical and reporting capabilities to CMCS users without requiring changes to the backend mainframe data collection process. There are currently an estimated 800 reports, which are combined schedule or on request, that are available to users and required to perform their Air Force FMS financial tasks.</p>
<p>Support. Contractor shall provide needed software, programming and development support, analysis and documentation support to the modernized front-end project to the Air Force Security Cooperation and Assistance Center (AFSAC) CMCS Program Manager and individual(s) who support the AFSAC CMCS Program office or designated USAF representative.</p>
<p>Breadth of Support. The contractor shall provide design and development of a web-based analystical platform on the current CMCS mainframe. The contractor shall work in coordination/cooperation with the AFLCMC/WFR CMCS Program Management Office (PMO) team, current CMCS software maintenance contractor support personnel, and DISA to provide application development including project management, architecture design, system integration engineering, system and process documentation, and programming. The current 800 reports would need to be analyzed and transformed to the new web-based analytical format and storage. The contractor shall also provide the ability for system configuration management, report server/storage, and a web portal entry for CMCS users.</p>
<p>Infrastructure. CMCS is built upon various FOCUS databases comprising of the following system groups: Financial Group includes Budget, Delivery Reporting, Expenditure Authority, Cash Management. Planning Group includes Case Profile. Management Support Group includes Decision Support, Databank History, Reconciliation, Case Closure Reconciliation, and Synthesystem. Interface system group includes FMS Integrated Control, Data Utility, Base Level Accounting, and Master Reference Tables. These databases will remain in tact, in the FOCUS 7.6.13, which they are currently designed. A new requirement includes a web based user interface built on top of the current mainframe databases. The mainframe system is housed at DISA DECC Mechanicsburg, PA with a current log-in behind DISA's Multi-host Internet Access Portal (MIAP).</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Each company responding should indicate their business size: other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and/or HUBZone in accordance with the stated NAICS code and size standard.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this acquisition is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $27.5M. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard.</p>
<p>All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract.</p>
<p>Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 15 pages with 12-point font with at least 1" margins.</p>
<p>Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Ms. Lauren Vanhook at lauren.vanhook@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "CMCS Software Maintenance." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</p>
<p>An AFLCMC Wright-Patterson Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from respondents and others for this sources sought. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this RFI. The AFLCMC Wright-Patterson Ombudsman is Col Peter A. Sandness; (937) 255-5512 or peter.sandness@us.af.mil.<br /><br />Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to Ms. Lauren Vanhook at <a href="mailto:lauren.vanhook@us.af.mil.">lauren.vanhook@us.af.mil.</a> <br /><br />RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 14 November 2018.</p>

The Government is refreshing its market research data via a FedBizOpps Sources Sought Request For Information (RFI) notification under the aforementioned solicitation number. All further FBO status updates will henceforth be published under the new solicitation number.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Currently, FAA flight services throughout the CONUS, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are delivered by the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) contract (DTFAWA-05-C-00031), with Leidos Innovations Corporation (Leidos).  AFSS provides the full range of flight services to users. This contract provides certified Flight Service Specialists who deliver preflight, inflight and flight data services to users via telephone and radios.  Leidos provides personnel, equipment and facilities for flight services under the AFSS contract.  The FAA provides Leidos with access to and use of its air-to-ground radio, ground-to-ground communications and telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate flight services. All services are provided in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.10 Flight Services.

FFSP Objectives

The FAA’s Future Flight Services Program (FFSP) vision is to transform and modernize the delivery of flight services. The FAA believes that costs can be reduced by focusing on changing user behavior and migrating to automated, self-assisted service delivery models, while still maintaining quality of service and safety.  

Through FFSP, the FAA seeks to create a contract vehicle and establish relationships with the Service Provider, industry and user groups to better position the agency to take advantage of user behavior changes and improved technology. 

Together, government and industry will work to realize three strategic goals:
1.	Reduce the FAA cost to provide Flight Service, with a target reduction over 65%.
2.	Encourage the use of technology, industry best practices, and authoritative flight data accessed through SWIM to improve efficiency and quality of service delivery.
3.	Facilitate and gain stakeholder acceptance of changes in Flight Service delivery.


II. CONTRACT TYPE & PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The FAA contemplates award of a Multi-year contract with a five (5) year period of performance followed by ten (10) one-year option periods for a total of fifteen (15) years, if all options are exercised.

The FAA intends to make one award under this Solicitation.  The FAA reserves the right to make no award if such action is determined to be in the FAA’s best interest.

III.  SET-ASIDE DETERMINATION & NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE

This procurement is not a small business set aside.

<div>&nbsp; <br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continues to embrace partnerships to achieve its strategic goals for expanding capabilities and opportunities in space. STMD has formulated five strategic thrusts that represent STMD's understanding of the vision for the future of civilian space relative to STMD space research. These thrusts represent major lines of investment within STMD's portfolio that are expected to have major impacts on space through 2040 and beyond. The strategic thrusts are:</div>
<div><br />&bull;	Go: Enable Safe and Efficient Transportation Into and Through Space<br />&bull;	Land: Increase Access to Planetary Surfaces<br />&bull;	Live: Enable Humans to Live and Explore in Space and on Planetary Surfaces<br />&bull;	Explore: Expand Capabilities Through Robotic Exploration and Discovery<br />&bull;	Prosper: Accelerate the Industrialization of Space</div>
<div><br />To support these strategic investment area thrusts, STMD is considering the following Exploration Campaign key technology focus areas for ACO 2019: Advanced environmental control and life support systems &amp; in-situ resource utilization; Power and propulsion technology; Advanced materials; Communications, navigation and avionics; Entry, descent, and landing; Autonomous operations; In-space manufacturing and on-orbit assembly; and Research to enable humans to safely and effectively operate in various space environments.</div>
<div><br />NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) is seeking partnerships that will focus on advancing technologies that can benefit both the commercial and government use of space. NASA is seeking to provide technical expertise, facilities, hardware, and software to accelerate the development and availability of these technologies.</div>
<div><br />NASA will solicit proposals that are led by a U.S. for-profit entity to partner with one or more NASA Centers as a team member(s) to enter into non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements (SAA) to support the accelerated development and testing of critical technologies for space system capabilities. A "U.S. for-profit entity" is a commercial firm or business incorporated in the United States (or an unincorporated U.S. firm with its principal place of business in the United States) that is controlled by U.S. citizens or by another U.S. entity. In addition to one or more NASA Centers, team members may include other U.S. for-profit entities, U.S. non-profit entities (including universities and educational institutions), and/or U.S, Federal, State and local government agencies, as appropriate to optimize the potential for rapid development and commercialization of the space technology. See Section 3.0 of the Announcement for complete eligibility restrictions. These non-reimbursable SAAs will serve to implement the awarded support/collaboration with participating NASA Centers and the awardees to implement a series of mutually beneficial activities consistent with NASA's 2018 Strategic Plan. The final announcement will provide additional information on technology areas being solicited.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />NASA anticipates using a two-step proposal process where a short mandatory preliminary proposal (MPP) is submitted in step one. NASA anticipates providing feedback on the MPP and inviting only the most highly rated/ranked participants to submit a final proposal (step two).&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;   <br />All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an authorized organizational representative (AOR). Registration Information and NSPIRES tutorials can be found at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/ under Getting Started. Potential participants and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system, ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. Interested proposers should monitor the NSPIRES website or subscribe to the electronic notification system for release of this solicitation and any amendments.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Technical, programmatic, and procurement comments and questions must be submitted in writing by e-mail to: <br />HQ-STMD-ACO@nasaprs.com</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Any documents related to this procurement will be available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ by selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Announcement of Collaborative Opportunity (ACO)."</p>
<p><br />It is the participant's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the final solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>

<DESC>*** Acknowledge ALL amendments with your proposal. ***

The purpose of this amendment is to answer perspective offerors' questions.
Q1:  During the tour, it was not evident why NPS requires a MPE to supervise the operation and maintenance of mechanical/electrical/plumbing/architectural requirements of this contract.  Can NPS declare what activities require a MPE? 
A1:  MPE is required that all work and repairs meet all local, state and federal codes.  MPE review all park projects for the park with Architects & Engineers.  MPE has daily inaction with Engineers from local agencies, meets with Engineers with local agencies and Utility Companies for NY and NJ.  MPE supervises all in house repairs and prepares in house designs on numerous projects in the park.  MPE reviews the designs in the park by park partners, park foundations meet all codes and life safety codes.  The MPE interacts and works with DOI/ NPS government Engineers on projects and repairs.  MPE inspects and certifies for both Liberty and Ellis mechanical and life safety systems for the NPS are safe and working properly.
Q2:  Licensed PE's are not typically associated with managing and directing Facilities Maintenance and Operations.  Requiring an individual to be a Licensed MPE narrows the field of applicants and eliminates individuals with solid Physical Plant and Facilities Operations and Maintenance background.  Would the NPS consider easing the MPE requirement permitting experienced Mechanical or Marine Engineers with solid operating experience and personnel supervision to be in contention?
A2:  NPS will NOT consider easing the MPE requirement.  Due to the highly technical mechanical systems identified in the Performance Work Statement, the NPS considers it imperative that a MPE be on site.
Q3:  Could you please tell us what the current monthly price is?
A3:  The Government's current monthly cost for the firm-fixed-price work is $289,575.37. 
Q4:  Is it possible to have the pricing sheets converted into or submitted in an excel version?
A4:  Attachment 0099 is replaced with Attachment 0099a, Proposal Schedule.  0099a is an Excel spreadsheet.

The Responses Due Time and Date remains 2:00 pm ET on 11/16/2018.

<DESC>The Government is seeking to identify qualified 8(a) vendors for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) with four option years for services to include experience in various IT and general business areas. As part of this process, this notice is seeking information from vendors to determine which companies have the functional/technical skills and interest to support this effort. 

Most work will be performed in Mechanicsburg, PA, but could be required in any Navy location in the continental US or Hawaii.

Some of the necessary key points to address at this time are:

· Staff augmentation (for gaps and/or surge) for a Navy IT agency (to include both IT and supporting non-IT positions)

· Anticipated task durations to be 3‐12 months

· Labor categories to be defined (limited examples include Data base manager, Software developer (by specialty), administrative assistant, Supply analyst (by specialty), etc)

· Pool of 8A vendors, with access to discuss anticipated needs in advance

· Quick 2-week turn-around task orders

· Candidate pools with appropriate certifications and security checks necessary (relevant to the skillset/position) already in place for quick starts

The NAICS code of 541519 listed in this sources sought is a preliminary chosen NAICS code and not necessarily the NAICS code that will be used for the contract.

<DESC>Re-Soliciting a Proposal for Performance Based Support of the H-1 and OH 58 programs. 5 year base Period, 5 Year Option Period<br />Solicitation Number: SPRPA1-16-R-009U
<p><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>DLA Aviation at Philadelphia is re-soliciting a requirement for the acquisition of performance based support, as follows - logistics management, which includes wholesale supply support, depot-level consumable support, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage, reliability improvements, and field engineering in support of Bell H-1 and OH-58 items. The original synopsis was posted on 31 May 2016 for the base contract which included this Performance Based Logistics (PBL) effort. The base contract has been awarded under Contract Number SPE4AX-17-D-9410. This re-synopsis is for the Performance Based Logistics (PBL) effort under this Captains of Industry (COI) Contract. This PBL effort is being re-synopsized in accordance with policy.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to fill DoD and FMS customer requisitions for approximately 3,404 Bell National Stock Numbers (NSNs) under this PBL effort. The NSNs are comprised of both consumable spares and those consumables required to support depot level maintenance. Actual Depot Level Repairable (DLR) spares will be added subsequently if required. The contractor will be required to meet supply chain performance based metrics for material availability for approximately 3,404 NSNs. The performance metrics will be based on the level of demand for the individual NSN. The contractor is also expected to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). Additionally, the contractor will be required to aggregate all material requirements, i.e. production, repair, allowances, in order to leverage the best value for material support. The contractor will be paid based on the aggregate demands or other appropriate measurements of usage of the H-1 and OH-58. The items that will be included in this contract are currently procured under various contracts with DLA. The contract will also include necessary support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The anticipated Contract will be strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies and Depot support. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to Government wholesale and retail supply points both CONUS and OCONUS within specified time windows, along with providing Depot Level consumables for repair of repairables.</p>
<p>Bell Helicopter Textron Incorporated is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these items with design control, authorization, and documentation to manufacture. Bell owns the data rights to these items. The Government does not have the drawings or complete data packages.</p>
<p>Under a Performance Based contract, a Contractor will carry out logistics functions for the specified items while meeting daily Service demand requirements (i.e., filling various Services requisitions) within a specified response time to CONUS and OCONUS destinations. DLA requires strategies that would include partnering with Government entities such as Organic Depots.</p>
<p>Performance Based functions will include: demand forecasting, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/ maintaining reliability. There are approximately 3,404 consumable items to be covered by this PBL effort which will be incorporated under base contract SPE4AX-17-D-9410.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two parts that have been upgraded since the original synopsis was posted on 31 May 2016. The two upgraded parts are:</p>
<p>1) From: Y LH Skid Tube // 015975903 // 450-036-104-103 <br />To: Y LH Skid Tube (Upgrade) // 016631174 // 450-036-104-105</p>
<p>2) From: Y RH Skid Tube // 015975905 // 450-036-104-104 <br />To: Y RH Skid Tube (Upgrade) // 016631178 // 450-036-104-106</p>
<p>There are also three additional items being added to the market basket since the time the last synopsis was posted on 31 May 2016. These items are as follows:</p>
<p>015241071 NSN: 450-366-001-102 FUEL CELL, AIRCRAFT<br />016218659 NSN: 449-036-106-101 AFT CROSSTUBE<br />015847204 NSN: 450-036-103-105 AFT CROSSTUBE</p>
<p>The contract will be constructed to allow for the addition of Consumable Parts and Depot Level Repairables (DLRs) to the initial population after initial award. Subsequent phases will include material required for support of Depot Level repairs and the repair of repairables. A full list of NIINs for this PBL effort and the respective Federal Supply Class (FSC) is attached. The Government retains the right to add and delete NSNs as necessary. <br /><br />The point of contact is the Contracting Officer, Jillian Goetz, DLA Aviation - APE.28, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis notice.  It modifies the previous sources sought notice for N0038319R007R to provide an updated Attachment A and provide the information below. 

Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia intends to solicit the Boeing Company (81205) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the items on Attachment A.  These commercial off the shelf (COTS) items comprise various airframe and avionics systems used on the P-8A.   Such COTS items are common to (i.e., used on) both the P-8A and the Boeing 737 aircraft and as such are also referred to as “commercial common” components.
  

Although it is anticipated in the future that P-8A COTS/commercial common repairs will be obtained competitively from eligible Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 CFR Part 145 repair stations, and NAVSUP WSS is currently actively exploring how best to achieve such competition, in the interim, sourcing guidance from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which has engineering cognizance of the P-8A aircraft, necessitates procuring the repairs for Attachment A items from the Boeing Company.

The estimated award date for the subject sole source procurement is December 2018.  The duration of the ordering period for such repairs is currently contemplated at six to twelve months.   

While the government only currently has the above-named source for repair of these items, potential interest in such repairs by other sources is welcome, and, as noted, this is being actively explored.
  NAVSUP WSS suggests that sources interested in offering future repairs by FAA Part 145 repair stations, (for example, as an integrator of such repair stations), contact Ms. Deborah Zaslow, Contracting Officer, by email at debra.zaslow@navy.mil.  

The contemplated award of this six-to-twelve-month effort will take the form of a modification to the soon-to-expire contract N0038316D016F with Boeing.   

For information or questions regarding this sole source repair procurement, please contact Ms. Alicia Rasich, Contracting Officer, by e-mail at Alicia.Rasich@navy.mil or phone (215) 697-3967.

<DESC>CODE AMC:3<br />This Special Notice of Intent to Award combined/synopsis constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03819QW000013 is issued as a Special Notice of Intent to Award to the Aircraft OEM, ALENIA AERMACCHI FINMECCANICA (A1512) LEONARDO S.PA. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the commercial buy as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. Contingent upon availability of funding, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the fully capable vendor LEONARDO S.PA that quotes the overall best value to the government. With exception of the Aircraft OEM, a capable vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Service Facility, and/or an OEM approved distributor facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the commercial buy, and be able to certify the accessories and parts are for the HC-27J. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV . If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item manager(s), engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Mr. Samuel Vigo (252) 334-5395, for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The Coast Guard intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase order to the Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for spares as follows: <br />ITEM # P/N NOMENCLATURE Qty LEAD TIME MFGCD <br />

Effective June 11, 2018, entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov to apply only for federal assistance opportunities such as grants, loans, and other financial assistance programs, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  Additionally, Effective June 29, 2018, all non-Federal entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and are proactive in maintaining the SAM registrations in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration.

<DESC>The government seeks to award a sole-source contract to Revision Military Ltd. of Essex, Vermont for technical support of government testing and integration of the Power Driver Managers (PDM) for the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) MK V system. The government also intends to acquire from Revision Military Ltd. two Advanced Battery Charger power adopters for charging the BB-2257 batteries used in one of the TALOS MK V subsystems. The PDM prototype was designed and developed by Protonex Technology Corporation (Protonex), a subsidiary of Ballard Power Systems (Ballard) under Contract H9222-15-C-0004. Ballard has subsequently sold the portion of Protonex that was responsible for developing the PDM to Revision Military Ltd. along with all of the intellectual property (IP) rights associated with the PDM.
<p>Providing technical support to the government for the testing and integration of the custom-built prototype PDM from Revision Military Ltd. is a logical continuation of the work performed by Protonex. Competing the work creates significant challenges for potential competitors as the IP is owned by Revision Military, capital investment requirements are prohibitive, and the need for significant resources to prepare for and manage the six-month effort. Additionally, the overall integration schedule of the PDM into the MK V, of which the PDM is a vital component, must be maintained.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit their capabilities to perform this effort in writing to the identified point(s) of contact not later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on November 15, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

Acquisition Plan Action ID: 688-19-1-478-0001

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 05, VA Medical Center, 50 Irving Street, NW. Washington, DC. 20422.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  
Requesting sole source procurement to preform maintenance and repairs which supports Operating and procedural Rooms of the VA Medical Center Washington DC.20422 This specialized equipment is used for processing critical medical instruments daily and therefore these services are needed to clean critical processing equipment for the OR areas and procedural rooms.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  
6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Services & supplies are only available from the original equipment manufacturer.  

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  

Advanced Sterilization Products has the only representatives authorized to service the sterilizers located within the VA Medical Center, any other representative attempting to perform service on this equipment would void any and equipment warranties.

Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.   Market research conducted through FPDS-NG found the same or similar service that ranged in price from $54,625-$75,145, the required price of $51,119.00 is well within the industry standard and is determined to be a fair and reasonable price for this service.
