<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) time and materials (T&M) contracts for technical assistance in the area of international anti-corruption.  The RFP will be posted o/a March 25, 2002. Proposals will be due on May 8, 2002. 

The worldwide trend towards democratization and the growing understanding of the costs of corruption have allowed USAID and other USG agencies greater opportunities to engage in efforts to fight corruption around the globe.  By supporting efforts by host government institutions, civil society organizations (including the media, youth, labor union and faith-based organizations) and the private sector, USAID seeks to promote greater transparency, accountability and broader participation in the development process.  The U.S.  Congress recognized the importance of anti-corruption and good governance assistance by passing the Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Act of 2000 (P.L.  106-309).  This law adds promotion of good governance as part of overall U.S.  development assistance policy and authorizes an array of activities designed to combat corruption and improve transparency and good governance in developing countries of particular interest to the United States.

Consistent with these goals, the objective of this activity is to curb governmental corruption in both political and bureaucratic offices.  This activity focuses on unilateral abuses by governmental officials such as embezzlement and nepotism, as well as abuses linking public and private actors such as bribery, extortion, influence peddling, and fraud.  Governmental integrity support activities under this contract are expected to encompass the following functional areas: (a) public financial, administrative, regulatory and personnel controls that promote transparency and accountability; (b) civil society participation in advocating for governmental integrity; and (c) promoting synergies between anti-corruption promotion and other sectoral/sub-sectoral areas, e.g., promoting greater transparency in other sectors, such as health and education, or in other areas of democracy promotion, such as rule of law or decentralization.

NAICS is 541611. This procurement is full and open competition with a partial small business set aside. Order of magnitude threshold: (estimated) $85,000,000.00. Numbered/nonnumbered notes do not apply.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for one each Osmium Plasma Coater, Model OPC-60, manufactured by Nippon Laser and Electronics Lab; 1 each Rotary Vane Pump for Model OPC-60 Osmium Coater manufactured by Nippon Laser and Electronics Lab; and 30 each 100mg Osmium Tetroxide Ampoules. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items on a sole-source basis from SPI Supplies in West Chester, PA, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  SPI Supplies is the only known distributor of the Osmium Plasma Coater in the United States and this particular coater is the only known coater that will satisfy the Government's requirements.  The Osmium Plasma Coater provides better coating control and morphology for analysis of samples in a field emission electron microscope than chromium or carbon evaporative coaters. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 3, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to establish multiple, 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development, revision, updating and presentation nationwide of training courses in the areas of Transportation Planning, Environment and Real Estate. These training courses may be for any of the following six FWHA program offices:
?	Metropolitan Transportation Planning 
?	Statewide Planning 
?	Natural Environment 
?	Human Environment 
?	NEPA Facilitation 
?	Real Estate Services

It is imperative that subject matter experts team with instructional systems design specialists to ensure that new course developments-- as well as updates of existing NHI courses-- incorporate adult learning principles. Over the five year performance period, it is likely that new course development and updating activities will require subject matter expertise in a variety of areas, including: environmental streamlining and stewardship, transportation planning, travel modeling, spatial data technologies, historic preservation, air quality, noise abatement, water and ecosystems management, non-motorized transportation, public involvement, historic preservation, Title VI compliance, community programs, Uniform Act, appraisal, acquisition, relocation, eminent domain, etc. 

Typically, course development materials are produced in an electronic format and include lesson plans, an instructor?s guide, participant?s workbook, reference manuals and related items. While most course presentations are instructor-led, distributed learning formats (e.g. CD-ROM, web-based, etc) may be specified.  Instructor-led course presentations require highly qualified, subject matter experts who have experience with deploying adult learning techniques in the classroom or have been certified as NHI Instructors.

<DESC>The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center's Detachment 12  (SMC Det 12/RP), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for award of one or more contracts to cover both the orbital and suborbital launch systems and launch vehicle services for the integration of various payloads using excess Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBMs) assets.  The Orbital/Sub-Orbital Program 2 (OSP 2), will provide enhanced capability and flexibility to the development of space launch and target vehicles using excess ICBM assets to meet a wide variety of mission requirements.  Launches will be required from Vandenberg AFB or the enhancement option of launching from the Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska may be exercised.  OSP-2 will allow RSLP to use excess ICBM assets in a variety of launch scenarios.  The offerors must have significant experience with ICBM rocket motors, launch system development, flight software, launch system fabrication and testing, payload and mission integration, range interface and launch operations, and financial reporting.  The anticipated Government requirements are as follows:  (1) The Contractor shall provide the launch systems and services necessary to meet the following missions:  Minuteman Class Target Vehicles, Peacekeeper Class Target vehicles, Minuteman Space Launch Vehicles, and Peacekeeper Space Launch Vehicles;  (2) The Air Force requires high reliability; therefore, emphasis will be placed on the degree to which the launch vehicle is flight proven.  These launch systems shall make maximum use of flight proven hardware and software, utilize excess ICBM assets to the maximum extent feasible, and provide flexibility and adaptability to accommodate multiple mission requirements;  (3) These launch services shall meet required launch dates, and respond to changes in launch dates while minimizing impacts;  (4) These launch services shall accommodate multiple missions with near simultaneous launches;  (5)  Must possess adequate financial and managerial resources to perform contractual requirements.  Potential offerors are advised that a U.S. SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of any resulting contract.  
The Government will select the best overall offer(s), based upon an integrated assessment of Mission Capability, Past Performance, Proposal Risk, and Price/Cost.  This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3 and the AFMC supplement (AFMCFARS) thereto.  Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  To arrive at a source selection decision, the SSA will integrate the source selection team's evaluations of the evaluation factors and subfactors (described below).  While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.  Submit unclassified information.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. William Orzech at (310) 363-0886.  For contracting issues, please contact SMC Det 12/PKN, Martin Baca, at (505) 853-6690.
Your proposal must arrive at the below address no later than 4:00 p.m., MST August 26, 2002, as indicated in block 3 of DD Form 1707.  Your past performance volume must be received at the below address no later than 4:00 p.m. MST on August 02, 2002.  Submit your proposal to SMC Det 12/PKN, ATTN: Mr. Martin Baca, Bldg. 415, Room 414, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117.  The Government does not plan to extend the solicitation.  Any questions concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Martin Baca, Contract Specialist, at (505) 853-6690 or Maj. John Seamon, Contracting Officer at (505) 846-4634.  You may also reach these individuals at the respective email addresses: martin.baca@Kirtland.af.mil, and john.seamon@Kirtland.af.mil.
The OSP-2 RFP is available on the Internet at the SMC Det 12 Home Page (http://www.te.plk.af.mil) under the PK (contracting link).  The RFP will also be made available on the Government's Electronic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov.  See Numbered Notes: 8, 25 and 26.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Assembly for School-Based Health Care (NASBHC), in Washington, DC  20001.  The purpose of this procurement is to develop a plan for the future use and refinement of the CQI tool to determine the tool's utility, management, and future development.  The NASBHC shall re-fine an evidenced-based CQI to strengthen the clinical outcomes of care for patients seen in the Bureau-supported school-based health centers.  NASBHC has played a leading role in advocating and nurturing an interdisciplinary, comprehensive and high quality of care in school-based health settings.  With the NASBHCs core value that inextricably links school success and good health and its understanding on the importance of community health and education partnerships as key to student success, the NASBHC understandably can legitimately assume the continuous refinement and development of the CQI tool.  Any other organization would have to replicate the tool before they could start work.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, NASBHC is the only source without substantial duplication of cost the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  This requirement will be awarded under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The antitipated period of performance is for a twelve (12) month period.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  A justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  This announcememt is for information only.  NO solicitation is available.  See Note 22.

Mr. Velie can be reached at (303) 651-4216.   <P> Special Requirements: The Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)is a 24-hour, 7-day a week operational facility.  Much of the work will be in highly sensitive areas, over and under critical equipment.  Risk management will be a high priority.  If in any case the work poses a threat to the continued operation of the facility, the contractor shall be issued a stop work order.  Contractor will need to coordinate activities to allow for a full-time escort while on the ARTCC grounds. <P> Expected Notice to Proceed (NTP)is August 1, 2002.  A pre-construction conference shall be held as soon as possible after date of contract award, and the NTP is expected to be issued and made effective that same day. The contract performance time is 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the NTP. <P> A specification package is anticipated to be available to offerors approximately July 8, 2002. <P> Proposals shall be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: (a) firm's experience in fire protection systems; (b) past performance on contracts of like systems and similar magnitude; (c) contractor's demonstrated ability to deliver performance on schedule; and (d) price. Price shall be evaluated separately only with firms who have been qualified as technically acceptable. <P> The magnitude of construction is estimated at between $300,000 and $600,000. <P> Prospective contractors are requested to contact me via email at phillip.sandoval@faa.gov.  It is anticipated that specification packages shall be mailed electronically to interested firms, since time is limited and award date must be met. <P>

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on a nonexclusive basis only and may include specific fields of use.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  Six-Phase Soil Heating and In Situ Corona.  Six-Phase Soil Heating is a rapid, cost-effective technique that steam strips contaminants from soils in place, eliminating the need for excavation or soil pretreatment.  In Situ Corona is designed to destroy toxic materials such as chlorinated solvents, PCBs, pesticides and industrial fuel oils and lubricants.

Six-Phase Soil Heating relies on an electrical current to heat the soil, causing moisture to boil and strip volatile and semi-volatile contaminants from soil particles.  The contaminated steam is removed through venting and treated above ground.  The splitting of conventional three-phase electricity into six separate electrical phases allows for more uniform heating and larger treatment areas.  Unlike conventional vapor extraction methods, this technique is effective in tightly bound soils, such as silts and clays, as well as saturated soils.  The process not only is less expensive than many conventional technologies, but quicker, requiring weeks to remediate large sites versus months or years with other soil-venting technologies.

Whereas the soil heating technique removes contaminants for above-ground treatment, In Situ Corona is designed to destroy organic contaminants underground.  Higher voltages are used to create an ionizing plasma, similar to a match flame, that destroys organic contaminants in place, or in situ.  This method is effective at destroying nonvolatile contaminants such as greases, pesticides and transformer oils containing PCBs.  In Situ Corona is still under development; however, Six-Phase Soil Heating has been demonstrated at several sites across the United States over the past several years.

In a field demonstration, soil heating was used to treat more than 675 metric tons of soil contaminated with trichlorethylene and perchloroethylene, including organics suspended in a clay layer nine meters (29.5 feet) below the surface.  Within 25 days, 99.7 percent of the contaminants were removed.  Most recently, the technique was used to treat contaminated soil at an electronics manufacturing plant, where more than 4,990 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of perchloroethylene was removed from tight clay soil within six months.

Please see US Patents 4,957,393; 5,316,411; 5,347,070; 5,330,291; 5,545,803.  Foreign patents also issued.  Please see:  Peurrung LM, Bergsman TM, Powell TD, Roberts JS, and Schalla R. "Six-Phase Soil Heating of the Saturated Zone", in Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds:  Physical, Chemical, and Thermal Technologies, ed. G. Wickramanayake and R. Hinchee, Vol. 5 (1998) pp. 63-68.  Battelle Press, Columbus, OH.

Six Phase Soil Heating has been fully developed and commercially deployed.  Battelle seeks additional non-exclusive licensees.

NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in non-exclusively licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs) with time and materials (T&M) pricing for technical assistance in the area of International Rule of Law and Justice Sector Technical Assistance. USAID estimates awarding approximately 4 contracts, including three unrestricted and one set-aside for small business, on the condition that it is capable of undertaking the work. USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $100,000,000 over the 5 year ordering period. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. Note that there is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded or the number of orders that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP. The RFP will be posted only at www.fedbizops.gov. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic media only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. Proposals are expected to be due on August 15, 2002. The purpose of these IQCs are to support developing counties' transition to, and consolidation of democratic governance through the rule of law, and the promotion and protection of human rights. Activities under this Subject Area will improve and enhance the Agency's performance in responding to challenges to the growth establishment and sustainability of legal and judicial systems which promote a rule of law consistent with respect for human rights and market based economies, commitment to legal equality, and democratic principles. In many developing countries with weak or nascent democratic traditions and underdeveloped economies, the processes and institutions which are necessary to uphold the rule of law are incompletely evolved, ineffective, or may not even exist. Their legal frameworks are often out of touch with social reality and contemporary needs, as well as diverging significantly from internationally accepted norms. Customary and informal practice may cause further deviations. When these conditions prevail, neither the rule of law, democratic reform nor sustainable economic development can be achieved. Activities under this Subject Area will fall within the following functional areas: (a) improving legal frameworks; (b) strengthening justice sector institutions; (c) increasing access to justice; and (d) building constituencies for justice sectoral reform. (e) improving host country human rights practices. (f) justice sector approaches to conflict mitigation and prevention (g) post-conflict transitions to rule of law.

<DESC>NA The USA Robert Morris Acquisition Center-Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Soldier Systems Center, intends to conduct negotiations and award a purchase order to Hexcel Schwabel, 22 00 South Murray Avenue, Anderson, South Carolina 29624-3139 on the basis of other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1.  A Firm Fixed Price purchase order is anticipated. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QU OTATION.  The proposed purchase order is for the manufacture of 1000 Yards of Zylon fabric in support of an ongoing research and development program.  The Zylon fabric required is specially woven at 1000 denier, 35x32, plain weave, with a scoured finish to  meet the needs of the ongoing test and evaluation.  Based on market research, Hexcel Schwabel is the only current weaver who has an established line for weaving this Zylon (1000 denier) in the United States.  The proposed contractor is ISO9001 certified a nd has produced this product before with no technical, quality or schedule deficiencies.  To insure fabric consistency between the developmental testing and the operational prototypes, it is essential that Hexcel Schwabel produce this 1000 denier Zylon fab ric to ensure consistency between the developmental testing and the operational prototype evaluations.  A change in the manufacturer of this material would have significant negative impact in terms of technical performance, quality and schedule given the e xtremely difficult and technical nature of the fabric being produced.  Award to another company would result in duplication of costs and delay the end results.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all qu otations received with forth-five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information rece ived will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by mailing information identified in FBO Numbered Note  22 to the U. S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, ATTN:  AMSSB-ACN-S/Peggy Dube, Natick, MA  01760-5011 no later than 12:00 noon on 8 August 2002.

<DESC>The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) plans to map seafloor habitat in the Northern half of the Sanctuary using side scan sonar (SSS) to create digital mosaic images of the seafloor for habitat characterization purposes.  This scope of work (SOW) addresses two program elements:  (1) an OCNMS element for the provision of a vessel, captain and crew and side scan sonar fish(es) and associated equipment and staff for operating in depths of 100 to 400 m, and (2)  side scan sonar fish and associated equipment and one technician for operating in depths of  <50 m off the RV Tatoosh, a 38 foot vessel owned and operated by OCNMS.  The RV Tatoosh is equipped with an A-frame, hydraulic winch, davit and an 1800 watt AC invertor.  The side scan sonar survey is being conducted to support seafloor mapping as further described in this solicitation.  Contractors can bid on the one or both elements in this package: nearshore and offshore side scan.  The costs for each element should be presented as separate cost items.

The duration for element (1) is for 5 to 10 continuous days for 24-hr per day operations between 1 July and 30 September 2002.  The duration for element (2) is for 5 to 10 days of 12-hr per day operations from 15 to 26 July 2002.   The contractor responsibilities are listed below.  

Project Area:  For program element (1) the project concentrates on the area between 124?57'W to 125?20'W and between 48?03N to 48?20N in U.S. waters (Figure 1).  For program element (2) the project concentrates on the area between 124?44'W to 124?52'W and between 47?55N to 48?09N (Figure 1).  These project areas are approximate and some minor changes may be made by OCNMS during the survey.

Program Element (1) Scope of Work 
Program element (1) will be between 5 and 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. A port day can be added but is not considered as one of the 5 to 10 continuous days. Mobilization and demobilization days, as well as transit time to and from the Sanctuary are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 1 July and 30 September 2002. The dates and length of the cruise will be set at the time the contract is awarded. Loading of contractor equipment at location of contractors choice; however, contractor shall plan for OCNMS staging (mobilizing) in Port Angeles, WA or Neah Bay, WA.  In Port Angeles this can be arranged by contacting the US Coast Guard and City of Port Angeles for access to the city pier.  Demobilization can occur in either Port Angeles or Neah Bay, WA and will be set at the time the contract is awarded.  Note:  OCNMS does not expect to have much gear to mobilize, mainly staff and computers.

Bids packages for Program Element (1) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

 Vessel:  
The contractor shall supply a vessel, with crew, of sufficient size/tonnage to operate 24 hrs/day, for the length of the cruise, up to 40 nm off the Washington Coast. The minimum vessel length is 80 ft.  The vessel must have appropriate deck equipment (winches, metering device, A-frames, davits, etc.) & operators to deploy and operate the side scan and associated equipment. The vessel must also accommodate up to 3 OCNMS personnel with berthing, shower & head.  The vessel shall provide meals. The vessel shall be equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS).

For this element two potential boats follow; however the contractor should not feel obligated to use these vessels.  Both have operations ongoing in the Sanctuary; therefore, mobilization and demobilization costs may be saved by using them.

Side Scan Data Acquisition System:  The contractor shall provide a SSS system to collect digital SSS imagery for mosaicing.  A tow fish such as an Edgetech DF1000, Klien 5000, or equivalent shall be used, maximizing resolution between 200-300m depth but capable of mapping depths of 100-400m depths.  The digital side scan sonar data shall be geocoded using the tow fish position.  The tow fish geographic position (GP) shall be calculated using the DGPS system and a Sonadyne, Track Point II, or comparable USBL system.  Cable out should be recorded on a common time base.

Digital SSS Data Format: The contractor shall provide the digital SSS data in a format readable by CARIS HIPS (version 5.2) by Universal Systems LTD, phone (506) 458-8533, however logging to Triton-Isis (XTF) is desirable.  Information and specifications on CARIS SIPS and data formats may be obtained from Universal Systems LTD.  Positioning shall be NAD83/WGS84 coordinate system.  Greenwich Mean Time shall be used for all aspects of data collection.  Data shall be delivered on CD media. 

Operations: 
1.	Accuracy - The side scan sonar system shall be operated in such a manner that it is capable of detecting and recording vertical differences in the seabed of 15 cm and 20 cm horizontal differences in an across track orientation.
2.	Range Scale - The achievable horizontal range scale of a side scan sonar is a function of several parameters.  Among these are sonar conditions, seabed composition, range scale in use, side scan sonar system characteristics, and tow fish height.  Actual conditions in the survey area will determine the effective range of a particular side scan sonar system.  If the effective range scale of the side scan sonar is reduced due to external factors, then the acceptable swath coverage should be reduced accordingly. The SSS shall be primarily operated on the 200-meter range scale but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative.  
3.	Line Spacing - Line survey lines shall be oriented parallel to each other and be spaced at a distance 50% of the effective range scale apart.    
4.	Survey Speed -The pulse repetition rate (PRR) determines the speed at which the transducer (i.e. the vessel) can move along the track and still maintain the required along track coverage of the bottom.  Longer-range scales have slower PRR which require slower vessel speeds.  The side scan shall be towed at a speed such that an object 0.5 m3 on the seafloor would be independently ensonified a minimum of three times per pass.  The maximum vessel speed for three ensonifications can be calculated as follows:  Maximum vessel speed (m/s) = target size (m) x prr/3 (sec-1).
5.	Tow fish Height - The side scan tow fish shall be towed at a height above the bottom between 8% and 15% of the range scale in use.  For tow fish heights below the 8% of the range scale in use the effective scanning range is defined as 12.5 times the tow fish height, provided adequate echoes have been received.
6.	Confidence Checks - Confidence checks of the side scan sonar system shall be conducted at least once daily.  These checks should be accomplished at the outer limits (~85%) of the range scale being used.  Each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard channels) shall be checked to verify proper system tuning and operation.  Confidence checks can be made on any discrete object, offshore structure, or bottom feature that is convenient to the survey area.  Targets can include wrecks, rocks, navigation buoy moorings, distinct trawl scours, or sand ripples.
	
Communications: 
Because the scientific staff may need to communicate with other research vessels, commercial vessels, & shore based facilities, the Chief Scientist or designee shall have access to use of radio transceivers & other available communication equipment.

Mechanical Breakdown: 
The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment & vessels in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the vessel or SSS equipment that is >12 hrs, the vessel & SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing a vessel and/or SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Fuel & Water: 
The contractor is responsible for providing all fuel needed to perform the contract. Any breaks from contract work to take fuel or water will be considered time off charter, for billing purposes.

Program Element (2) Scope of Work: 
Program element (2) consists of the contractor providing side scan tow fish and associated equipment, cable and navigation system to support conducting side scan sonar operations off the RV Tatoosh.  This survey will be 5 to 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. Mobilization and demobilization will occur in Neah Bay, WA.  Mobilization and demobilization days are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 12 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 15 to 26 July 2002.  OCNMS will provide lodging in Neah Bay; however, the contractor will include other travel expenses.  

Bid packages for Program Element (2) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

Side Scan Data Acquisition System, Digital Data Format and Operations: The SSS requirements follow those as stated under Program Element (1), except that the tow fish shall be primarily operated on the 50-meter range scale (but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative), and positioning of the fish may be accomplished using algebraic calculations or similar algorithms taking into account measured cable out, water depth, fish height and cable cantenary.  

Mechanical Breakdown:  
The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the SSS equipment that is >6 hrs, the SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.



Items Common to Both Program Elements:
Reports & Documentation - The contractor shall record & maintain a record throughout the cruise. Information on daily operations, problems encountered, weather and sea conditions and operational milestones shall be recorded.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a base year of twelve months for a maximum value of $10 million per year for all three indefinite quantity contracts.  The contract contains four, twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of sixty months or a maximum value of $50 million whichever comes first.   
The solicitation will result in the award of three Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to three 8(a) contractors who provide the most advantageous, responsive and responsible proposal resulting in the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  The acquisition will be limited to 8(a) firms servicing the Chicago District Office which have a NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, and 235.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.  The project objective is to procure renovation, alteration, repair, construction and design/build capability by means of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Naval Training Center, Great Lakes and their fifteen state area of responsibility.  Requirements for general building type projects include administrative, training, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project, which is the Small Arms Ammunition Bunker, Great Lakes, IL.  The preponderance of the work in this contract will be maintenance and repair work, and occasional new construction with some design capability required.  Task orders placed on this contract may include 1) 100% design; 2) performance specifications; or 3) may require the contractor to do necessary design work.  Work will be performed at Great Lakes Naval Base and within a 75-mile radius from Great Lakes.  Offerors will be technically evaluated based on the factors described in the solicitation.  
The solicitation for the acquisition of these improvements will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NAVFAC Acquisition Supplement (NFAS) for a negotiated procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government. The estimated price range for the seed project is $100,000 - $300,000.  Firms are expected to participate in the pre-proposal conference.  The Government intends to evaluate and award the seed project without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price (price of seed project plus modification markups).  The best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project and an IDIQ construction contract for the base year and four option years.  The second and third rated contractors will receive contracts awarded at the same time with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 during the sixty-month period.
All three contractors awarded an IDIQ Contract will compete on subsequent task orders.  Task orders will range in size from $100,000 to $3,000,000.  These projects may include 1) 100% design; 2) performance specifications; or 3) may require the contractor to do necessary design work. The salient requirements of the individual task orders will be scoped by the Government/Contractor team to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work.    Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, based on either beset value using the trade-off process or low price technically acceptable to the government.  Award factors may include past performance, quality of deliverables, ability to meet schedule requirements, relevant experience, cost control and price or cost. Awarded task orders will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task with a specific completion date.
All three selected Contractors will be required to participate in all MACC walk-throughs and submit proposals.  Failure to participate responsibly in walk throughs and submit proposals on task orders may result in the Government not exercising the option to extend the contract with the Contractor for an additional year. Only the three selected 8(a) contractors will be permitted to propose on future task orders.  Proposals received from other contractors will not be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for development and demonstration of a laser micro-sensor probe for making profilometry measurements of coating defects in Primary Reaction Control System thrusters using Windows based software. The requirement is to demonstrate the probe's compliance to tight design requirement (e.g., 0.0002 accuracy and approx. 125" X 0.70" X 0.60") in measuring defects on the complex surfaces of a supplied thruster, in raster scan and 3-axis helix scan mode while using Windows-based software for data acquisition, analysis and display using a dynamic color pallet. Concurrent integration of data from a separately supplied eddy probe shall be demonstrated to show a capability to measure defect penetration through interior protective coating. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Laser Techniques Company (LTC), Bellevue, WA under FAR 6.302-1. LTC is the only known source that can supply the very small, high accuracy (0.0002-in), self-contained laser micro-probe package (approx. 1.25" X 0.70" X 0.60") that is integrated with a Windows based package for data acquisition, graphics and data display. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 5, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The NCI/NASA Fundamental Technologies for the Development of Biomolecular Sensors Program is soliciting projects to develop the fundamental elements of technology systems or system components that will measure, analyze, and manipulate molecular processes at appropriate scale in the living body. The discoveries from this program are intended to enable the development of complete systems for the in vivo sensing of signatures of pathologic cell types or closely associated microenvironmental factors that provide a seamless interface between sensing/detection and delivery of signature-specific intervention.

<DESC>NA The Robert Morris Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a modification to contract DAAD13-01-C-0009 for additional work pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  The current contract pr ovides for the production of the M56 Smoke Generator Systems (SGS) and the production of components for the M58 SGS.  The contract was awarded to General Dynamics Robotics Systems through full and open competition.  The modification will upgrade older M56 and M58 SGS to the current improved configuration.  The improved design includes the addition of safety panels to prevent debris from escaping turbine enclosure in the event of catastrophic compressor failure.  This new design was incorporated into the M56  technical data package by the approval of an engineering change proposal.  This action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to GDRS as the only source which can satisfy the Army's requirements.  There are currently serious safety issues which must be  addressed on an expedited basis.  It has been determined that competing this action would adversely impact the Army fielding schedules for retrofit of M56 and M58 SGS.  Retrofit schedules have been established to mirror the priority established in the Dep t of the Army Modernization Priority List.  In addition, award to another firm would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government which are not expected to be recovered through competition.  Performance take place at various fielding locati ons to include Ft. Leonard Wood, MO; Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; Ft. Bragg, NC; Ft. Hood, TX; and several other U.S. Army bases.  See Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>08092002
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Robert Krumhansl, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4791
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Technical Support for the Green Construction Specifications Project  Following are the Background, SOW with required Tasks and Deliverables schedule, and the Evaluation criteria to be used for a Best Value to the Government award decision. The EPA website for any potential additional information on this RFQ is http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0200187.index.htm   ** Background:**  	Under Executive Order 13101 (issued in September 1998), EPA is responsible for providing guidance to federal agencies to assist them in practicing  environmentally-preferable purchasing (EPP).  EPA's Environmentally-Preferable Purchasing Program is currently developing a number of tools to help federal purchasers practice EPP.  The EPP suite of tools is described on the EPP webpage at <www.epa.gov/oppt/epp>.* 	Because construction and  renovation of buildings constitute a large share of federal expenditures, the EPP program has a special interest in providing tools to promote environmental purchasing during these activities.  Being able to offer federal building project managers, as well as private sector architects, access to a  database of construction specifications, from which they could write specifications for both new construction and renovation projects, that describe quality, affordable environmental products would support that goal. * 	In FY2000, theGreenTeam, Inc. conducted, under contract with EPA, a  Feasibility Study for Green Construction Specifications Database.  In particular, the Study addressed the feasibility of creating or compiling model green specifications language that could be available initially to federal agencies and eventually to the public. This Study demonstrated that there  is extremely little "quality" technical language guidance available.  Also, while developing technical language "from scratch" appeared quite costly, the Study identified a few projects in the public domain that could be used to form the basis of model green construction specifications language.  Despite differences in style and format, the various project examples tend to specify similar green construction materials and methods.  Their similarities reinforce the prevailing green building industry perspective that certain ?green minimums' are being established and can be expected for a  green building.  However, they also indicate that ? in both federal work and in private projects ? the industry has matured sufficiently that, without such a resource compiling current best practices, excessive time and energy may be spent on researching and developing green construction  specifications language that already exists in some form or fashion.* 	Based on the study and comments received subsequently, EPA seeks contractor support under this statement of work for technical support in identifying and developing content to be used for development of a publicly available  Green Construction Specifications data resource.*** Tasks:** 	The contractor shall perform the following tasks:* TASK 1.  Review existing environmentally preferable purchasing documents.  Eliminate redundant information.  Reformat to model construction specifications language (in CSI format).   Identify issues and model specifications language in Divisions 1-16 relative to: resource management and conservation, toxicity and impacts on human health, and performance issues such as energy efficiency and water management.  It is intended that ONLY green specification language be included in  the Database, not entire specifications sections.  It is estimated that the Database shall include 40 - 50 Technical Specifications Sections plus 8 -10 Division 1 Sections.** TASK 2.  Incorporate other publicly available, specifications language.  Such language includes:  NAVFAC, USPS, and  WasteSpec.  Using this information, provide the same process as task 1.** TASK 3.  Build compilation into "model language."  The Database will be the most useful to building industry professionals (both public and private) if it includes not only sample contract document language, but also  guidance regarding the editing and development of such language.  This is consistent with industry master specifications that typically include ?notes-to-Specifier' and/or separate coordinating ?instructions' for editing/developing the specifications. Incorporate environmental issues  information.** TASK 4.  Develop specific revision recommendations to the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) Industrial Store for Construction Products.** TASK 5.  Develop specific recommendations for cross-referencing this project work to the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG).  ** Deliverables and Schedule:** All five tasks are due to be completed by March 31, 2003.** All deliverables shall be made available in both hardcopy and electronic format.  The contractor shall consider environmental impact as well as cost and quality when preparing deliverables.  For example,  paper deliverables shall be double-sided and printed on recycled content and/or non-wood fiber paper.*** Technical Evaluation Factors ** Resumes for Key Personnel Should Reflect:** Evaluation Factor #1: * Familiarity with the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat ** The key  personnel for this project have at least 5 years of experience working with the CSI MasterFormat in some capacity.  An example of relevant experience could involve writing construction specifications.  **  This factor will be weighted at 40%**** Evaluation Factor #2:  * Environmental Expertise  with Respect to the Built Environment  The key personnel for this project demonstrate extensive knowledge about environmental impacts of the built environment, especially as those impacts relate to products and services used in the construction and renovation of buildings. ** This factor will be  weighted at 40%**** Evaluation Factor #3:* Experience Providing Environmental Information to Construction Project Managers, Architects, and Others who Select Product and Services to be used in Building Projects The key personnel for this project have at least 3 years of experience providing  information on the environmental impacts of building products and services in formats that have proven helpful to construction project managers, design professionals, and others who work in the building sector. **        This factor will be weighted at 20%.**** Award will be on a firm fixed  price basis to the offer representing the best value to the Government.  Technical factors specified above are more important than price. It is anticipated that an award will be made during July 2002.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620 and this requirement is 100% Set-Aside for Small  Business Concerns.***

<DESC>The purpose of this modificaction is to answer several questions and to include an uploaded copy of a C-Package drawing as follows: QUESTIONS: 1.  What is the foot print of Diode Array (i.e., height, width and depth).  Can comparable or smaller be used?  The Arrays have gotten smaller over the years. ANSWER:  A drawing is attached showing the mechanical dimensions of an SDL C-Package.  The solicited device packaging must be identical as they are desired to fit into existing NASA-made housings for pumping solid-state laser rods. 2.  I any lensing required? ANSWER:  No lensing is required. 3.  Why is 6 100 watt diode bar needed?  Can a 2 100 diode bar be used if it meets the other specifications? ANSWER:  A total power from all bars of 600 watts is required.  It would seem that 2 100 watt bars would only generate a total of 200 watts 4.  Is the total output required by each array 600 watts or 100 watts? ANSWER:  The total output from each array is 600 watts. The uploaded document is a drawing of a C-package device.  This drawing was made in-house at NASA LaRC by measuring an existing devise.

All other statements of the announcement remain unchanged.

<DESC>NA DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM.  (For further information, call 866/724-7457.) Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 02.2, was publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on May 3, 2002.  DoD will begin accepting proposals in response to this solicitation on July 1, 2002. Six DoD components will participate in the 02.2 solicitation – the Departments of the Army and Navy; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ; the Missile Defense Agency (MDA); the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Defense Research and Engineering; and the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  The solicitation will list all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and wil l also contain detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $60,000 to $100,000 to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular co ncept.  Proposals are limited to 25 pages in length.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept, usually to the prototype stage.  On May 3, 2002, DoD also released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) the names of the SBIR solicitation topic authors and their phone numbers.  This will give small companies an opportunity to ask technical questions about specific solicitation topic s by telephone before they submit a proposal.  Once DoD begins accepting proposals on July 1, 2002 such telephone questions will no longer be accepted.  Phase I proposals are to be submitted to the addressees designated in the solicitation, and must arrive  no later than 3:00 P.M. local time, at the addressee’s organization, on August 14, 2002.  A hard copy of the solicitation will be mailed automatically to all firms registered with the SBIR Help Desk as of April 30, 2002.  To register, call the SBIR Help D esk at 866-724-7457.  Hard copies and/or electronic copies of the solicitation will also be available from the SBIR Help Desk (866-724-7457) after July 1, 2002.  Small firms participating in the SBIR program retain patent rights and technical data rights, in accord with Public Law 97-219, Public Law 102-564, and Public Law 106-554.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms.  All questions rega rding this announcement should be referred to Mr. Ivory Fisher.  He can be reached at (703) 588-8616, or by e-mail: Ivory.Fisher@OSD.mil .

<DESC>NA This Description revises the previously posted Description dtd April 05, 2002 as follows:  This procurement is for one Solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) resulting in the Award of a maximum of three Indefinite Delivery /Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction Contracts with firm-fixed-price Task Orders. The Contract will be used for minor construction, repair, maintenance, and design/build type projects. The MATOC services are for the Rock island District, Corps of Engin eers in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Each Contract will include a Base Year period and four Option Year periods. The estimated maximum dollar value for all Contracts combined will be $3,000,000 for the Base Year period and $3,000,000 for each of the four Option Year periods, with a total maximum Contract dollar value NTE $15,000,000. Contract guaranteed minimum amounts for each of the Base Year periods will be $60,000 and for each of the Option Year periods, if exercised  by the Government, will be $30,000. The anticipated range for each Task Order is between $2,500 and $3,000,000, with most Task Orders falling in the range of $50,000 and $1,000,000. This acquisition will be limited to eligible 8(a) Firms who have a bona f ide place of business located within the geographical boundaries of SBA Region V (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, & Wisconsin), and SBA Region VII (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, & Nebraska).  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this procurement are 233, 234, and 235.  The Small Business Size Standards are $28.5 Million, $28.5 Million, and $12 Million, respectively.  Although it is possible that the Government ma y award a total of up to three Best Value IDIQ Task Order Contracts, all eligible 8(a) Firms who submit Proposals for the RFP will compete for the Award of the initial Best Value IDIQ Contract which will include competing for the proposed Task Order No. 00 01, identified as follows: Renovate Arsenal Club Restrooms, Building 60, First Floor, West Wing, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Illinois.  It is anticipated that the 8(a) Firm who is awarded the initial Best Value IDIQ Contract, which may or may not inc lude the above proposed Task Order Task Order No. 0001, will meet that Contract’s guaranteed minimum amount for the Base Year period of $60,000.  Each additional 8(a) Firm who is selected by the Government to be awarded a Best Value IDIQ Contract, will rec eive a Contract minimum guaranteed amount of $60,000 to be reached for the Base Year Period of those Contract(s). The request For Proposal(RFP) Solicitation date is scheduled for July 24, 2002. All 8(a) Offerors who are awarded a Best Value IDIQ Contract a s a result of this Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) Solicitation, will compete for subsequent Task Orders proposed during those Contract Base Year periods, and Option Year periods, if those Option Year periods are exercised by the Government.  Ea ch awarded Task Order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent Task Orders may be awarded using either the best value trade-off continuum or low price.  If the Government decides to issue a Task Order as a bes t value procurement, the award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for that Task Order. Should one of the three IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a Task Order to meet the minimum Contract guarantee, then the Government r eserves the right to negotiate a Task Order with only that Contractor. The Government reserves the right to extend the terms of any or all of the Contracts awarded.  If the Government exercises an Option Year period for any or all of the additional Best Va lue IDIQ Contracts awarded, the Government will do so by issuing a subsequent administrative Contract Modification to those Contracts. The Award of the initial Best Value IDIQ Contract, which may or may not include the above mentioned proposed Task Order No. 0001, will be made using Competitive Proposal negotiation procedures for achieving the “Best Value” to the Government through the Source Selection (Tradeoff)  Process, and will be made to the 8(a) Offeror whose combined Technical Proposal and Price Proposal for the proposed Task Order No. 0001, meets the Government’s needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner. This means that an Award may not ne cessarily be made to the lowest priced 8(a) Offeror, even if technically acceptable.  Furthermore, Award may not necessarily be made to the 8(a) Offeror rated the highest in the non-cost areas, if the perceived advantages are considered not worth the cost premium. Although cost is not the most important consideration, it could be controlling: where an otherwise superior Proposal is at an unaffordable or unreasonable cost, where two Proposals are otherwise considered equal, or where the advantages of a super ior Proposal are not worth the cost premium.  In selecting which 8(a) Firm’s Proposal represents the “Best Value”, the Contracting Officer will consider the Technical Evaluation criteria Factors and relative importance.  Using this as a guide, the Contract ing Officer shall determine which Proposal overall represents the “Best Value” to the Government by comparing the technical and the cost advantages and disadvantages of all the Proposals. The Government reserves the right to Award any of the possible Contr acts with or without discussions.  All competing eligible 8(a) Offerors are advised that it is definitely possible that an Award may be made without discussions or any Contact concerning the Proposals received.  Additionally, the Government reserves the ri ght not to award the proposed Task Order No. 0001.  The proposed Task Order No. 0001 may or may not be awarded through this Contract or any other Contract.  Also, the Government reserves the right to Award only one Contract including the proposed Task Orde r No. 0001. The Government, further, reserves the right, with sole discretion, subject to the availability of funds, to Award the proposed Task Order No. 0001 within 120 calendar days after Contract Award to the 8(a) Offeror submitting the best value Propo sal in response to the for Request For Proposal (RFP) Solicitation. After the Government evaluates the Technical and Price Proposals received, a Competitive Range will be determined by the Contracting Officer.  The Competitive Range will consist of all of the most highly rated Proposals against all Technical Evaluation criteria Factors and Prices proposed.  The Contracting Officer may limit the number of Proposals in the Competitive Range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amon g the most highly rated Proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f)(4). The Best Value Source Selection process consists of the evaluation of Technical and Price Proposals submitted. A Competitive Range determination will be made by the Contracting Office r after all Technical Proposals are evaluated, a Technical Evaluation Report has been submitted and accepted by the Contracting Officer, and all Price Proposals have been considered. Technical Evaluation Factor Relative Importance:  All Technical Evaluatio n criteria Factors and Sub-Factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Technical Evaluation criteria to be used to determine the “Best Value” to the Government in the form of a Technical Proposal, in descendin g order of importance are:  PAST PERFORMANCE, EXPERIENCE, COMPANY STRUCTURE, and SAFTEY. The Government will determine the Award of up to three Contracts based on Technical Proposals and Price Proposals submitted for a proposed Task Order No. 0001 project is identified as follows: Renovate Arsenal Club Restrooms, Building 60, First Floor, West Wing, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL. The estimated range of the  proposed Task Order No. 0001 project is between $100,000 and $250,000. It is anticipated that the 8(a) Offeror who is awarded the initial Best Value IDIQ Contract and proposed Task Order No. 0001 will meet the Contract guaranteed minimum Base Year period amount of $60,000. Each of the other 8(a)Offerors selected for Award of the additional IDIQ Contracts will receive Contract minimum guarantee amounts of $60,000 to be reached for the Base Year period of those Contracts. The Government reserves the right to  Award any Contract(s) with or without discussions. All Technical Evaluation criteria Factors other than Price when combined are significantly more important than Price.

<DESC>The Contracting Squadron of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC CONS), Randolph AFB, TX is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for Trainer Maintenance Services at Keesler AFB, MS and Sheppard AFB, TX.  This is a request for information and not a formal solicitation.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  

The trainer maintenance services for Keesler AFB, MS include maintenance support of approximately 2,100 trainers for meteorological and navigational, computer, special computer, weather and control radar, ground radar, ground radio, digital and analog communications and security, space system training equipment, and associated equipment missions of the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MS.   Also included is operating 81st TRW Category IIB Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL), which supports approximately 15,000 items annually.  This function provides regional support for customers such as the Air National Guard and Navy.  The service provider must hold a Top Secret facility clearance.  Personnel working in the special computer area must hold a Top Secret security clearance.  

The total period of performance for Keesler AFB will be seven to eight years, structured by a basic contract period and up to seven option years.  

The trainer maintenance services for Sheppard AFB, TX include maintenance on training devices, aircraft engines, Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), historical/static displays, and Test and Measurement Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE).  Also included is management of the munitions storage area (MSA), Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS), Air Force Repair Enhancement (AFREP) and Circuit Card Repair (CCR) to ensure the best, most efficient, safe, reliable, and effective resources are made available to Sheppard AFB.

<RESPDATE>071902
<CONTACT>Richard Puthoff, Contracting Officer, 509-376-8853, richard_o_rick_puthoff@rl.gov;Andrew Wirkkala, Contract Specialist, 509-373-7835, Andrew_H_Wirkkala@rl.gov
<DESC>This announcement constitutes an official Sources Sought synopsis. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The Department of Energy (the Department) will be soliciting proposals in early 2003 from private industry for the rendering of occupational medical services for the Hanford Site. The Department's occupational medical service requirements pertain to Hanford Site employees who work in industrial, construction, environmental cleanup, analytical laboratory, and research laboratory settings where exposures and hazards are associated with such environments, including hazardous/toxic waste, biological agents, beryllium, and radioactive materials including forms of uranium, plutonium, and other transuranic materials.  Additional information on the Hanford Site can be found at http://www.hanford.gov. At present, the Department is seeking industry interest in providing these services in the spirit of full and open competition.  Specifically, the Department is interested in industry advice on actions the Department can take to encourage offerors to propose on this important activity and any other measures that the Department can take to cause the services to be performed in the most cost effective manner.  It is requested that responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis be provided no later than close-of-business Friday, July 19, 2002. The types of services that are anticipated to be required are as follows: a. Medical Monitoring and Qualification Examinations, including: § Pre-placement evaluations, § Medical surveillance examinations and health monitoring, § Qualification examinations, § Voluntary periodic examinations, § Work capacity and return-to-work/fitness-for-duty health evaluations, § Ancillary testing (e.g., diagnostic and screening laboratory tests, audiology screening, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function tests, screening spirometry, visual testing tonometry, x-rays, other outsourced laboratory services), and § Termination (exit) health evaluations. b. Medical Surveillance c. Diagnosis and Initial Treatment of Injury or Disease d. Monitored Care e. Employee Counseling and Health Promotion f. Occupational Health Process Improvement g. Records Management h. Emergency and Disaster Medical Preparedness i. Health Care Cost Management j. Field/Facility Visits k. Case Management l. Records and Data Extraction m. Other Occupational Medical Services. At present, there are approximately 10,000 Hanford Site employees who receive occupational medical services.  Many of these employees are in scheduled examination/service programs.  During fiscal years 2000 and 2001, there were approximately 36,000 such examinations each year. The Department intends to procure the above services through the award of a single, performance-based, Cost Plus Award Fee, service, prime contract. The rationale for a single prime contract is based upon the Government's need for an integrated occupational medical program for the Hanford Site, and the need to maintain complete, consistent and accurate medical records for current and previous Hanford Site employees.  This contract is anticipated to contain a three-year base period with options to extend the contract an additional seven years. The Department of Energy is particularly interested in obtaining comments and recommendations concerning teaming and/or mentor-protégé arrangements that will optimize small business (Small-Businesses, Small-Disadvantaged Businesses, HUB Zone, Women-owned Businesses, and Veteran-owned Businesses) opportunities in this procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 621111.  The size standard is $6M. The draft solicitation is estimated to be released in late August 2002. The final solicitation is estimated to be released in early January 2003, though the release date for the final solicitation may be accelerated.  Both the draft solicitation and the final solicitation will be available for downloading from the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) website (http://e-center.doe.gov).  However, you must first be registered with IIPS in order to download the solicitation or submit a proposal. If you need technical assistance in registering, or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or e-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_helpdesk@pr.doe.gov. The decision to issue an RFP for the work described in this Notice is solely within the Department's discretion.  Please note that this Notice is not a request for proposals.  The Government will not pay for the information requested herein, nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government in response to this Sources Sought synopsis.

<SUBJECT>--Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask
<DESC>NA DESC: The Department of Defense (DOD) has a requirement to develop a lightweight, single use emergency mask for use in low Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) threat conditions and in military medical care situations where the use of the issued NBC pro tective mask is not practical as described in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the JSCESM.  The Government anticipates the JSCESM will be a modified commercial item, meeting the JSCESM requirements. The mask components will be optimized to m inimize weight and bulk while maximizing wearer performance and the ability to interface with Service protective equipment, communications systems and optical display and sighting systems. The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 339113 with a siz e standard of 500 employees     . To meet the schedule and performance objectives for the JSCESM, the program will focus on identifying a commercial item that can be modified to meet the requirements of the ORD, which have been set forth in a performance specification. The JSCESM program w ill be initiated with a Milestone B to enter the System Demonstration phase. Initially, the Government intends to issue a solicitation on a full and open competitive basis to acquire up to 100 prototypes from mask manufacturers.  The government then intend s to conduct testing and evaluation of these prototypes to assess how well the product meets the thresholds and best satisfies the objective requirements of the performance specification with emphasis on the key performance parameters. The evaluation is ex pected to also include human factors, cost and past performance.   Based on the results of this evaluation, the Government anticipates issuing a separate solicitation and limiting competition to those manufacturers that can best satisfy its needs. The gove rnment’s intent is to award one contract, through limited competition, which  will cover the System Demonstration phase and include an option for production.  A draft Statement of Work and Performance Specification, as well as other pertinent information, identified with draft Request for Proposal (RFP) No. DAAD13-02-R- 0031  will be posted on or about June  28,2002 at the following web site address https://www.abop.monmouth.army.mil, by selecting Army solicitations from the Robert Morris Acquisition Center ”, clicking on the Go Button and selecting the draft RFP titled Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask.  A pre-solicitation conference Industry Day is scheduled for July 11, 2002 at the Comfort Inn, 1700 Van Bibber Rd, Edgewood, MD (410) 679 -2997. The intent of this conference is for the government to present a brief overview of the JSCESM program to include program objectives, milestones/schedules, procurement approach, and users' concerns and to answer questions from prospective offerors. I f desired, industry representatives may present information on their product in an open forum or there will also be the opportunity for a one-on-one (single company) session with government representatives to discuss or brief government personnel on their in-house efforts.   The government is soliciting comments on the draft statement of work and performance specification and encourages comments and supporting rationale as to what industry envisions as the primary cost drivers and the ability to modify exis ting commercial products, as well as any questions relating to the requirements.  Pre-registration for this conference is mandatory and shall include the following information: contractor's name; complete   mailing address; point of contact to include voic e/data telephone number and e-mail address; preliminary questions relating to the acquisition; and confirmation as to whether a presentation  (open forum or one-on-one) is desired.

<SUBJECT>--Technical Report.  Perform analyses on new data set of Anthrax vaccination records and disability discharge and prepare report on findings.
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center intends to conduct negotiations with and award a contract to Applied Epidemiology, Inc, PO Box 2424, Amherst, Ma 01002-2424, on a basis of other than full and open competition, reference FAR 6.302-1(a) for writing a Tec hnical Report regarding performing analyses on new data set of Anthrax vaccination records and disability discharge and prepare report on findings.  Final report shall be in the form of a manuscript suitable for publication in peer reviewed literature and shall be delivered 6 weeks after contract is awarded.  Applied Epidemiology, Inc have completed one study of Anthrax and disability.  Applied Epidemiology is the only source who can conduct this research as proposed since it is a specific continuation of w ork already completed by Applied Epidemiology and for which they have the required databases.  Competing the additional effort would necessitate duplication of all the work previously accomplished.  There is no reason to believe this would result in a cost  saving.

<SUBJECT>A -- Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cells
<DESC>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Seeking Partnerships with Industry to Develop and Commercialize Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cells Technology

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking industrial partners to further develop and commercialize Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cell Technology

The earth's atmosphere faces a detrimental accumulation of greenhouse gases-especially CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels. This has led to considerations of increasing the efficiency of energy production from fossil fuels and managing the release of the product CO2 to the atmosphere through integrated production and sequestration technologies.

LLNL scientists have developed a novel configuration for a carbon/air fuel cell that consumes particles of carbon and oxygen (e.g., from the air) in a molten salt electrolyte and produces electric power at practical rates at an efficiency of 80% based on the heat of combustion of carbon.  LLNL has intellectual property in such areas as cell configurations and refueling, control of melt saturation of fuels and components, rejection of impurities, and preparation of fuels.

Government uses for this technology include efficient electric power generation in broad mobile, transportable and stationary applications. 

Potential commercial applications include electric power generation at high efficiencies from coal-derived carbon, petroleum-derived fuels, petroleum coke, biomass charcoal and natural gas. 

LLNL has filed patents on various embodiments of these inventions.  LLNL is seeking industrial partners to license and commercialize LLNL's direct carbon conversion fuel cell technology. LLNL is also interested in collaborative research and development partnership to develop a prototype, improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's direct carbon conversion fuel cell technology should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-016-303

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.
