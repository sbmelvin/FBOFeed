<DESC>This was previously posted under Special Notices as MNK-04-0001.  
A sole source procurement is contemplated with Reynolds Systems, Inc, (RSI) 18649 Hwy 175, Middleton CA, 95461-1229. RSI is the only known qualified source to perform this effort. The requirement is for fabrication of a Low-Energy Exploding Foil Initiator(LEEFI). This LEEFI must be a low-energy input device with high-energy output that can detonate a main charge of PBXN-9. There is also a requirement for a low amount of inert material and a rugged surface mount. The delivered LEEFI will be used to support the development, test, and evaluation of adaptable warhead technologies. The Government has determined that the RSI LEEFI configurations are the only low-energy initiation technologies available that fully meet its requirements. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government intends to purchase these items under FAR Part 12 as commercial items. The total effort is not expected to exceed 6 months. After delivery, the Government will be responsible for any further examination, mounting, and integration of these detonators into warhead systems. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses submitted should be in one copy only and must be received within 15 days from the date of publication. Responses should be sent to AFRL/MNK, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Ste. 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810, Attn: Linda Weisz, (850) 882-4294 ext 3405, e-mail: Linda.Weisz@eglin.af.mil. Any non-technical and/or contractual questions should be referred to the above individual. Technical questions may be directed to AFRL/MNMN, Tonya Savage, (850) 882-2141, ext 2214, e-mail: tonya.savage@eglin.af.mil. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an IFB or RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for Deep Impact Mission Nutation Time Constant Determination Follow-On Testing.  NASA/KSC is currently verifying mission requirements for the Deep Impact mission, scheduled to launch in December 2004 on a Delta 7425 launch vehicle.  The Delta 7425 launch vehicle uses a spin-stabilized Star 48B third stage, and the requirement is on the third stage/spacecraft combination divergent nutation time constant (NTC).	  NASA/KSC intends to purchase the services from Applied Dynamics Laboratories, Inc., 7001 Northbank Road, Roseburg, Oregon, 97470.  Contracting without full and open competition is permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) because the services required by NASA/KSC are available from only one responsible source.  Applied Dynamics Laboratories, Inc., (ADL) is uniquely qualified to provide the government the necessary testing.  ADL’s spinning drop test capability, which is required for this testing exists at no other firm.  ADL performed the original testing in early 2003 to estimate the NTC, but further testing is required to refine the estimate.  ADL also developed and maintains the Deep Impact dynamically-scaled model used for the original testing and required for the follow-on testing.  Award to another source would require fabrication of a new test article, which could cause delays and invalidate comparison of test results to previous results due to differences in the test article. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, January 30, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The project consists of the design and construction of the Los Alamos Site Office Administrative Building.  The anticipated new LASO building would be a two or three story, approximately 37,000 square feet building.  An available construction site has been identified on existing DOE/NNSA property in Los Alamos, New Mexico, located on the South East corner of West Jemez Road and Bikini Atoll Road.  Therefore, this project would not require the acquisition of land.  The occupancy projection is for 125 (+/- 10) federal and contractor employees (majority of Facility Representatives are located at their facilities).  The building would contain single and multiple occupancy offices and include a small security area with vault type spaces.  The structures will be constructed to standard commercial building practices and will only provide office space for employees.  No hazardous/radiological materials will be involved.  This building will require all utility tie-ins, security and access control, and telecommunications.  This project complies with LANL's Comprehensive Site Plan and the Core Area Development Plan in Technical Area 3 (TA-3).  The selection process used for this solicitation will be a two-phase design-build Request for Proposal.  Phase One shall require the offeror to submit relevant qualifications, including experience and past performance, and overall technical/design approach.  Phase Two shall require the offeror to submit a unique technical solution for this project in the form of drawings, narratives, management plan, schedule, and price.  No more than 3 offerors will be selected for Phase Two. Proposed procurement will result in a fixed-price contract. The acquisition is restricted to small business concerns.  The NAICS is 236220 with a size standard of $28,500,000.  The magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $7,000,000.  Bonding will be required for this acquisition.  The Statement of Work/Specifications must be requested by submitting a question through IIPS.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center's Headquarters Procurement Office is currently conducting a progressive competition to acquire global land-cover change data and data products as a continuation of the 30-year-old Landsat Program.  Currently designated as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), LDCM is the next component of the Landsat program being conducted jointly by NASA and USGS.  The goals of the LDCM are in keeping with the Landsat programmatic goals stated in the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 and the Commercial Space Act of 1998.  This policy requires the Landsat Program to provided data into the future, that are sufficiently consistent with previous Landsat data to allow the detection and quantitative characterization of changes in/on the land surface of the globe. This procurement will be conducted using full and open competition procedures in two distinct phases:  Formulation and Implementation.  During Formulation, offerors develop the preliminary design of the system that will acquire the data, business plans and other relevant documentation.  On March 28, 2001, NASA awarded formulation phase contracts to DigitalGlobe of Longmont, Colorado, and Resource21 of Denver, Colorado.  The formulation phase contracts each have a nine- month period of performance, and will be completed in December 2002.  The competition for the Implementation Phase will build on the results of the Formulation Phase, and the award criteria for the Implementation Phase will include successful completion of the specified Formulation Phase Requirements.  Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only the Formulation Phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the Implementation Phase.  However, any responsible source may submit a proposal for the Implementation Phase.  Upon request, prospective offerors for the Implementation phase other than the Formulation Phase contractors will be provided all material officially furnished to the formulation phase contractors necessary to submit a proposal.  To be considered for the Implementation Phase award, offerors must demonstrate design maturity equivalent to that of the Formulation Phase Contractors, such demonstration to include any Formulation Phase deliverables upon which the Implementation Phase award may be based.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  NASA intends to release a draft version of the Implementation Phase Request for Proposal (RFP) for consideration and comment on/about September/October 2002.  This draft RFP will be posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service Web site at http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=04.  This draft RFP is for information and planning purposes.  No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this draft RFP.  Potential Offerors and LDCM data users are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation, including the requirements, proposal instruction, and evaluation approach.  If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions for the comments to be considered.  NASA intends to release the final Implementation Phase RFP in December 2002/January 2003 timeframe.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments.  Any referenced numbered notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html.  The draft RFP will provide instructions as to the location and method of providing any comments.  If you have any questions, you may contact the Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, at (301) 286-4223.  An ombudsman has been appointed. NASA has uploaded with this notice a pre-release of the Draft LDCM Data Policy and a Draft Data Rights Table for comment.  All comments on these prerelease documents should be sent to the NASA Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, by email at jbecker@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov, or by facsimile at 301-286-7434.   To the extent practicable, NASA intends to pre-release additional sections of the RFP for comment prior to formal release of the draft RFP.  Any such pre-release is considered a market research tool and is provided for information and planning purposes only.  No response to any prerelease information is required, but comments may be submitted to the Contracting Officer if desired.  These pre-releases will be announced by posting a notice on the NAIS, directing the offeror to the LDCM public website where the pre-release information can be found.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for any such announcements.   NASA intends to hold a Pre-Solicitation Conference, tentatively scheduled for December 2002, prior to release of the final RFP.  The exact location, date, and time of this conference will be announced in a subsequent NAIS notice.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for this subsequent announcement. NASA is also using this notice to assess the availability of electronic and information technology that meets all or part of the applicable accessibility standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board at 36 CFR part 1194.  Potential offerors may submit comments at any time to the Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, at jbecker@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.   See numbered note 26. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 54171.

Based upon market research, the Government will utilize policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, in its solicitation for the supplies and services.

US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N00164-04-Q-0092 is hereby issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-19 as well as DCN 20040113. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 332995 and the size standard is 500 employees. The following is a sole source to Tactical Ordnance & Equipment Corporation, 2228 E. Commercial Street, Meridian, ID 83642. This requirement is for the following:  CLIN 0001 A quantity of 2250 Tactical Combat Slings, IAW-the following: Sling Body is made from 1.25 inch brown webbing.  Sling ends are made from 1.25 brown tublar webbing.  The elastic ends are manufactured so that the elastic is permanently sewn into the tubular webbing. This 1) decreases the chance of the sling snapping, and 2) increases the life of the elastic by concealing it from the elements and abrasion. 3) leaves less chance of snagging or tearing the cover  because it becomes an integral piece of the system in contrasts to having a removable sleeve. The tubular nylon shell is sturdier than standard nylon shell.  The snap hooks are spec Picatinny Arsenal snap hooks.  The loop slots in the hook are 1.25 inches.  This prevents premature wear.  Each individual hook will withstand 1000 newtons of force when attached to webbing.  (224.80 ft lb) The Picatinny part number i s #934864 Mil-W-13863 finished to  5.3.1.2 of Mil Std-171.  Assembled sling will hold 400 lbs of continuous force and much higher momentary force. Secondary tri-glides are used to secure slack instead of elastic loops.  This prevents tearing  and slipping of slack material. Delivery is required F.O.B. NSWC Crane, IN 47522 within 30 days after award. Final inspection will be at destination. Selection for award will be based on past performance and price.

<CONTACT>Allan Ziemba 850-235-5197 , or Contracting Officer Carol Dreger at 850-234-4863.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City, intends to issue a solicitation for currently available Un-tethered Underwater Mine Countermeasures Vehicle (UUMCMV) system(s) that can be provided to Fleet users for evaluation.  The UUMCMV is for use from Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) vessels, specifically MCM-1 and MHC-51 Class Ships.  The U.S. Navy is interested in mature, un-tethered, underwater mine countermeasures (MCM) vehicle platforms with commercially available off-the-shelf subsystems/sensors to support search-classify-map (S-C-M) and environmental data collection MCM missions in the water depths of 40 to 300 feet.  They must be deployable/recoverable from the MCM-1 and MHC-51 class ships with existing shipboard equipment.   Ultimately, the S-C-M mission will entail systematically reconnoitering through predetermined geographic areas (notional 5 nm X 5 nm) and precis ely mapping the bottom contour while providing for the classification of objects that exhibit mine like characteristics.  Additionally, the same vehicle will, in the near future, be utilized for Reacquisition-Identification (R-I) of objects that exhibit mine like characteristics thus requiring this system to employ a mission module scheme. The system must be easily deployable, with a small shipboard footprint.   Telephone requests will not be accepted.  No Solicitations or Amendments will be mailed to offerors.  Solicitations and any Amendments may be downloaded from http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/Contracts/Tables/soltab.htm.     Potential offerors requesting the solicitation will be notified by email when the solicitation has been released to the NSWC-PC Internet.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis the following items:  1) The CMRTR Build 3 sensor relies on a Ball Joint Gimbal (BJG) for precision pointing and stabilization of the LADAR Field of Regard (FOR).  One of the limitations in the current sensor is the accuracy of determining the position (i.e. pointing angle) of the mirror attached to the (BJG).  An approach is sought that can provide better than one part in a million position accuracy over a range of a few inches.  The technique needs to be non-invasive of the current structure of the CMRTR build 3 sensor and BJG assembly.   In addition the system sought must be able to make this measurement at rates up to 1 kiloHertz to assure timeliness of the data for use in closing the control loop for the BJG mirror.    Since the edge of the mirror mounted on the BJG moves in an arc the position measurements must be able to account for this translation and still maintain the desired accuracies.  The output of this measurement system must be in a digital format that is compatible with the BJG control system.  In addition to these stressing measurement requirements, the desired approach must be able to operate in an airborne environment and be resistant to the temperature excursions, vibration, EMI, and RFI associated with that environment.  The design prepared in Phase 1 of this effort must undergo laboratory evaluation in the Phase 2 effort, and flight-testing in the Phase 3 effort.  To meet these requirements the sensor must be breadboarded for the laboratory evaluation, and brass boarded for the flight-testing.  The testing in the laboratory will require comparisons of this approach to current position sensing as well as evaluations for absolute accuracy.  The final brassboard flight worthy configuration must maintain the desired level of performance under the airborne conditions expected for the CMRTR Build 3 flight test planned for later this year.  The Phase 2 effort must be accomplished in 60 days, and the flight test system must be completed 30 days after Phase 2.  Phase 3 flight-testing shall be supported in the form of problem analysis, troubleshooting, and repair any brassboard failures or deficiencies. This requirement is sole sourced to Laser Science and Research, 1545 S. Wells Ste. 100, Reno, NV 89502.   Any firms believing that they can build the 3 sensor relies on Ball Joint Gimbal (BJG), may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 5 days after the date of publication of this notice.  It must clearly show the firm’s ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the data without causing programmatic hardship.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Therapeutics Branch (CTB) plans to procure supplies and services for Synthesis of 2'-Alkoxy, 3'-deoxyphosphatidylinsolito ether lipid analogues" from Acenta Discovery, Inc, 9030 South Rita Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85747.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325411 and the business size standard is 750 employees.  The Signal Transduction Section of the NCI, studies signaling pathways involved in tumors.  The goals of this section are to identify clinically relevant kinases whose modification may alter tumor formation and/or growth, and to develop approaches to inhibit theses identified kinases.  Akt (or, Protein kinase B (PKB)) is a well -characterized serine/theonine kinase that promotes cellular survival.  Akt can be activated in response to growth stimuli as well as stressful stimuli.  Activation requires phosphorylation of 2 amino acids, one in the activation domain and one in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif.  Phosphorylation of the site in the activation domain is dependent on the products of an upstream kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), phosphatidylinositol 3, 4 biphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate (PIP3).   PIP2 and PIP 3 bind to pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt, which result in translocation of AKT to the plasma membrane, where the two phosphorylation events subsequently occur.  NCI, CTB has collaborated with Alan Kozikowski at Georgetown University, also with University of Illinois at Chicago and Scientific advisor to Acenta Discovery, who has molecularly modeled the interaction of PIP2 and PIP3 with the PH domain of Akt, and has synthesized phosphatidylinositol (PI) ether lipid analogues that were designed to inhibit the binding of PIP2 and PIP3 to the PH domain of Akt, thereby inhibiting Akt activity.  Increased synthesis will allow further study into the biologic activity of these compounds and allow the Developmental Therapeutics Program to assess the suitability of these compounds for further development as possible drugs.  The NCI and Georgetown University are co-Inventors of these compounds, and they can only be made efficiently by the team at Acenta Discovery with the consultation of Dr. Kozikowski, developer of these compounds.  Period of Performance:  Upon award through six (6) months; FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend services (November 1999) applies.    Requirement: The biologic studies and animal studies will require synthesis of approximately 100 mg of each effective compound (SH5, 6, 23, 24 and 25) as well as 100 mg of an ether lipid analogue that lacks an inositol ring and, therefore, serves as a negative control.  Additionally, 10 mg amounts of each of the inositol head groups will be required.   Acenta Discovery, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the expertise to synthesize the compounds needed to continue the existing experiment in progress.  Dr. Kozikowski is a Professor and Head of the Department of Medicinal Chemotherapy and Parmacognosy at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the founder of Acenta Discovery.  He has published extensively on the synthesis of compounds designed to inhibit various molecular targets.  Importantly, he was the first to discover and synthesized 3'deoxyphosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues that serve as precursors for the 2'-alkoxy-, 3'-deoxyphosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues.  His compound synthesis is innovative, elegant, consistent and reliable.  The compounds themselves are unique and have not been described in the literature.  These compounds could eventually be used to treat cancer or other diseased characterized by Akt activation.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, February 9, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40030-NG.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking qualified A & E firms.  The NRCS, Idaho, proposes to contract for the final design of a pressurized pipeline irrigation water delivery system for the Little Wood River Irrigation District (LWRID).  The project is located in Carey, Blaine County, Idaho.  The final design shall include the preparation of construction drawings and specifications for the conversion of the LWRID’s open earthen canal/lateral ditch system to a pressurized pipeline system.  The LWRID supplies water to 10,800 acres of irrigated cropland and small pasture areas in and around Carey, Idaho.  The design will be completed in accordance with the general features for the project as outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement prepared by NRCS for the Little Wood River Irrigation District Gravity Pressurized Delivery System.  The NRCS preliminary design evaluations for the EIS indicate that the required peak design flow for the pipeline distribution system is 180 cfs.  The proposed distribution system consists of two pipelines that begin at the existing diversion in the Little Wood River and follow the general route of the open canal/lateral ditch system.  The pipeline irrigation system will deliver water to individual on-farm irrigation systems.  The proposed distribution system will require approximately 40 miles of pipeline (combination main trunk line and spur lines).  The upper end of the system will require booster pumps to pressurize the on-farm sprinkler irrigation systems.  The contract will be a firm, fixed-price Architect-Engineer (A&E) contract.  The contract will require services including: confirming location for all individual on-farm points of water delivery; finalizing pipeline layout route(s), final design of pipeline and appurtenances, including booster pumps on upper end of the system, outlet assemblies to the individual on-farm systems and  final design of the inlet/screening structure; preparation of final construction drawings and specifications, a design report, cost estimate, bid schedule, operation and maintenance plan; and consultative services during construction.  The selected firm will be required to perform the design activities in accordance with Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and certify that the design meets applicable NRCS criteria.  All drawings will be computer generated in *.dwg format.  Well documented electronic copies and original hard copies are to be furnished to NRCS.  The estimated cost for the construction of the pressurized pipeline system is 20 to 30 million dollars.  
Selection of the A&E firm will be based on the following criteria, shown in descending order of importance: a. Specialized experience and knowledge in the design of pressurized irrigation water distribution systems; b. Knowledge of NRCS policy, criteria and procedures; c. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the work; d. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time frame; e. Past performance on contracts with the Federal government and private industry; and f.  Location in general geographical area of the project and demonstrated knowledge of the locality of the project.  The above evaluation factors will be weighted as follows:  (a) 30%, (b) 15%, (c) 20%, (d) 15%, (e) 10%, and (f) 10%.

This solicitation will not be restricted to any group or business size pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. NAICS Code: is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $4,000,000.
 
Firms interested in providing these services and which meet the requirements described in this announcement are to submit 4 copies of Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications.  Interested firms must submit their SF-330s not later than 3:00 p.m. on March 1, 2004, to the attention of the Contracting Officer, 9173 W. Barnes Drive, Suite C, Boise, Idaho  83709.  Only those firms responding by that time will be considered for selection.  If the offeror plans to use a subcontractor, separate SF-330s must be submitted for the subcontractors.  A minimum of three of the most highly qualified firms will be selected for discussions and will be ranked by the A&E Evaluation Board for negotiations.  The most qualified firm will be asked to provide a cost proposal. All questions must be directed to the contracting officer in writing by e-mail at Janis.Stanton@id.usda.gov, by facsimile to 208-378-5735, or by letter to Janis Stanton, Contracting Officer, USDA-NRCS, 9173 W.

<DESC>Work Description:  This stream restoration will consist of the removal of sediment and rock from the Guadalupe River in Comal County in the area of the Horseshoe Falls subdivision.  Horseshoe Falls is located 9 miles North and 4.5 miles West of New Braunfels, Comal County, TX.  The project encompasses an area approximately 2,100 feet along the Guadalupe River in a reach of the river known as Horseshoe Falls.  This is approximately one mile downstream from Canyon Lake Dam.  Sediment, rock, and other materials were deposited in the river by the discharge from the Canyon Lake emergence spillway as a result of the July 2002 rain storms.  These sediments and materials are a potential risk to the downstream environment as they are unstable and will move downstream during high river flows.  The cleanup operation will remove these materials and stockpile them on adjacent U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s property.  The limits of sediment/rock removal are the limits set by the U.S. Corps of Engineers as identified on detailed cross sections provided by NRCS.  NRCS will provide for the removal of the sediments and the U.S. Corps of Engineers will take responsibility and ownership of the materials once stockpiled on Corps property.  Only one award will be made for the entire project.  The NAICS Code is 234990.  Performance period will be 60 calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed date, which will be on or about February 27, 2004.  A 20% bid bond will be required.  Performance and payment bonds of 100% each will be required of the contractor awarded this contract.  This project is unrestricted.  Price range is from $250,000 to $500,000.  Site showing will be conducted on February 17, 2003, 10:00 A.M., at the Comal County Commissioner’s Court, 199 Main Plaza, New Braunfels TX.  Solicitation will be posted and be available to download on or about February 2, 2004.  Effective October 1, 2003, all contractors are required to be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to being awarded a contract by NRCS.

The distribution system consists of approximately 153,000 linear feet of underground service and an estimated 60,000 linear feet of overhead service. natural gas distribution system: Gas is supplied to the base via a single 8-inch coated steel supply line. The cantonment area and housing areas are separately metered and on separate looped distribution systems, but are connected by valves to be used if necessary. System pressure is maintained at an average of approximately 40 psi, with seasonal adjustments for changes in demand. A great majority of the distribution system consists of polyethylene piping which is considered to be in good to excellent condition. The potable water distribution system: Water is supplied by the City of Altus via one 16-inch and one 10-inch main. The main base and housing areas are metered separately for monitoring purposes. The distribution system consists of 85% polyvinyl chloride pipe, with the remaining pipe consisting of transite, cement-asbestos, and cast iron lines. Potable water is stored in two elevated storage tanks with a total capacity 750,000 gallons. Maximum system pressure is maintained at approximately 55 to 58 psi. The present distribution system is not a loop-type system, and three dead-end lines require monthly flushing. The wastewater collection system: Wastewater is collected and discharged into the City of Altus sanitary sewer system for treatment. The on-base collection system is in poor overall condition. Most of the original system is predominantly concrete or vitrified clay pipe which has deteriorated over the past 40-plus years due to highly corrosive soil conditions. The collection system includes three lift stations, two of which have been recently renovated. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation. Offerors from small businesses will be considered first. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Managaer, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Ali Humaid Al-Adwawi, Director of Air Navigation Services, P.O. Box 1 P.C. 111, Seeb International Airport, Sultanate of Oman, Phone:  (968) 519-699, Fax:  (968) 519-930, Email:  alialadawi@dgcam.gov.om  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to demonstrate the use of international satellite test beds for advanced air traffic management.

USTDA has worked closely with partner countries in the region and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to promote greater regional cooperation in aviation safety and security in the Middle East.  Promoting the transition to the use of satellite navigation technology by aviation operators is a high priority of both the FAA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  These organizations promote the safety and operational benefits that the Global Navigation Satellite System will provide to the aviation community.

In this project, the Middle East Planning and Implementation Regional Group, an ICAO subcommittee, intends to develop a regional test bed to better understand satellite-based augmentation system technology, demonstrate its feasibility for navigation in the region, and plan the engineering and financial resources necessary for providing a modern communications, navigation, and surveillance/air traffic management capability.  The USTDA-funded study will determine the placement of the test bed master station and the number and location of the reference stations for the best coverage of the region.  

The tasks for the study are summarized as follows:

1. Determine Locations of the Master and Test Bed Reference Stations
2.  Preliminary Environmental Assessment
3.  Economic and Financial Analysis
4.  Installation of Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems Test Bed   Equipment
5.  Final Report

The selected contractor will be required to work closely with the FAA’s Middle East regional team during the performance of the study/pilot, while working closely with the Omani civil aviation authority (CAA) and the other regional CAAs participating in this project.
 
Most of this project involves the procurement and demonstration of the master and reference test bed stations (Task 4).  All equipment related to the demonstration would become the property of the individual civil aviation authorities involved in the project.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $460,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by Monday, March 8, 2004 at 4:00 p.m. local Omani time at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>With this announcement, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Special Projects Office (SPO), is providing advance notice of a new Research and Development (R&D) program, Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTI C).  In support of the TACTIC Program, DARPA plans to release two Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) simultaneously:  BAA04-TDT (TACTIC-DT, Detection Technologies) and BAA04-TCM (TACTIC-CM, Countermeasure).  These efforts will represent the first phase of t he TACTIC Program. The TACTIC Program focuses on interception and defeat of chemical and biological threat agent aerosol/vapor clouds on the battlefield that can be produced during military operations either by defensive measures against an adversary or by intentional agent dissemination/release by an adversary.  Release of such agents could cause widespread disruption of military operations.  The TACTIC Program seeks to actively protect troops and military assets from such events and to provide a means to maintain critical m ilitary operations at the required tempo by pursuing two paths in parallel:  1) development of technologies that can rapidly detect, discriminate and identify chemical and biological airborne clouds with low false-alarm rates, and 2) development of technol ogies that can defeat (precipitate and/or neutralize) the clouds before they can reach the troops on the battlefield.   The actions outlined in this Notice are intended solely to enable potential sources to gain an understanding of the TACTIC Program prior to the release of the associated BAAs.  It is DARPA's intention to release the BAAs, which will be posted on the Federa l Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, approximately two weeks after this Pre-Solicitation Notice is released.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the release of the BAAs. A Pre-Proposal Conference (BiddersÃ¢Â€Â™ Brief) will be held approximately three weeks after the FedBizOpps BAA releases.  The conference will be held in Virginia, at Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.  The morning session will be dedicated to discussions of TACTIC -DT and the afternoon session will be dedicated to TACTIC-CM.  Attendance at this meeting is voluntary and limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that might contribute to the success of the TACTIC Program .  However, attendance is not required in order to be deemed eligible to propose on this program.  Instructions for registration, along with all TACTIC Program information will be provided at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/TACTIC following release of the BAAs.  Re gistration will close 3 days prior to the conference. The DARPA TACTIC Program Manager will be available for meetings, telephone conferences, or video telephone conferences to discuss technical approaches from Proposers, during a two week period following the Pre-Proposal Conference.  These can be scheduled b y contacting BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil. The anticipated scope of work to be covered under the TACTIC Program includes:  development of the detection or countermeasure technology to the specifications outlined in the Proposer Information Pamphlets (PIP) for each respective BAA; a (mathematical) m odel that predicts the probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA) (for the detection technology), and a model that predicts the performance of the countermeasure (e.g., log reduction in live agent); experiments conducted at Performe r laboratories and testbeds; experimental results coupled to modeling to predict performance of the technologies, and; testing conducted at a Government aerosol testing laboratory.   If testing at the Government facility is deemed successful, the Government will initiate a new Phase, to integrate Detection Technologies and Countermeasures into an operational system.  This Phase will include a new competition for Performers.   The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with the Pre-Proposal Conference discussed in this announcement.   Questions of a technical nature should be sent to BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil.  Questions of a contractual nature should be addressed to: Ms. Marjorie Roberts, Contract Specialist, marjorie.roberts@us.army.mil.

The course session length is 32 hours (4-days) and the session sc hedule is as follows:  Honolulu, HI, 24-27 February 2004; Virginia Beach, VA, 23-26 March 2004; Huntsville, AL, 13-16 April 2004; and San Diego, CA, 4-7 May 2004.  Class size is 27 students.  The instruction team shall consist of two instructors present du ring the full 32 hours of instruction.  The Government shall provide classroom space, government forms and all training equipment, reproduction/duplication of government training materials.  The contractor shall provide all services, personnel, materials ( other than those provided by the Government), A-V aids, travel and lodging for contractor personnel. The course material presented will develop a shared understanding of:  (1) The Learning Organization and Leadership for Learning Doctrine; (2) Common language of leadership, for current leaders and those who might want to be leaders; (3) The selection and development of leaders as a Ã¢Â€ÂœBe, Know, Do, Learn process; (4) How leaders understand the context they operate in, the logic for necessary success, and the process for leading organizational change. The CorpsÃ¢Â€Â™ intent is to develop leadership at all levels to address current challenges.  Ã¢Â€ÂœLeaders at All levelsÃ¢Â€Â requires a shared understanding of effective leadership; a shared understanding of effective leadership today which is not veste d in position, but is created through interactive, collaborative relationships.  This understanding includes why todayÃ¢Â€Â™s knowledge and service work requires a particular kind of leadership at all levels of the Corps. This course about effective leadership today helps learners understand their assumptions about leadership as well as the importance of enhancing strengths rather than repairing weaknesses.  They will also learn about their own strengths and character as po tential leaders.  The course explains the importance of selecting and developing this effective leadership that is required by the challenges, strategic direction, values and vision of the Corps. Based on the BeÃ¢Â€Â”KnowÃ¢Â€Â”DoÃ¢Â€Â”Learn Cycle of continuous improvement, learners will understand the elements of improved leadership:  character (including talent themes), knowledge, and skills, and the continuous learning leaders need to be effectiv e leading organizations.  Many leader development programs today do not distinguish between knowledge, skill or character development, and miss systematic organization learning entirely.  This course will focus on understanding the interrelationships betwe en  context, logic, character, knowledge, skills, organizational learning, effectiveness, and innovation. Course topics include the Changed Context or the Corps of Engineers, the Learning Organization, Leadership vs. Management, System Thinking, Empowerment, Strategic Leadership, Talents and Strengths, Aligning All Parts of the Corps Culture, Leadership Tools,  Operational Leadership, Ss of Culture, Personality Types, The Five Dimensions of Corps Leadership, the CorpsÃ¢Â€Â™ Ideal Future, Bureaucratic vs. Interactive Organization, Interactive Planning, Being a Leader Who Creates Organizational Learning, Expert vs . Self-Developer Social Characters, Be-Know-Do-Learn, Resistance to Change, and Motivation. The principal instructor should have: (1) practical work experience in leadership related topics set forth in the Statement of Work (50% of his/her time devoted to these functions), (2) knowledge about the Corps of Engineers Learning Organization Doctrine and Leadership for Learning Doctrine, (3) teaching experience in leadership in a learning organization involving instruction of adult learners in a work-related setting, (4) an earned MasterÃ¢Â€Â™s degree from an accredited institution in public  involvement or with a major area of emphasis related to the Statement of Work Ã¢Â€Â“ or substitute a Baccalaureate degree in the related fields of business, sociology, psychology, or public affairs plus five years teaching experience.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 TO: DG1330-04-RP-0015

This amendment is posted to publicize answers to questions that were asked from offerors in the public domain regarding the International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety Conference.

Question 1. 	On Page 2 of the Solicitation under Agenda, the RFP talks about Base period, Option Period I, Option Period II…Do these refer to the 3 sets of dates with Base Period being June 7-11, Option Period I being June 14-18 and Option Period II as June 21-25?  If not, please advise as to what is to go in these sections.

ANSWER: No, that interpretation is incorrect.  The above sets of dates are the desired dates the Agency would prefer for Conference scheduling purposes in the 2004 Base Year.  Please note that the dates in question are all Monday through Friday in the year 2004.  Desired Option Year conference dates will be identified during the planning phase for those upcoming conferences.

Question 2. How many exhibits will you have specifically and what sizes will they be? 

ANSWER: There will be up to 20 exhibits, at 8 feet by 8 feet each.

Question 3. How many Posters will you have and what size will they be?

ANSWER: There will be up to 100 Posters at the standard poster board size, 4feet by 8 feet each.

Question 4. Should I still bid if we are not exactly ½ mile from a metro subway station?

ANSWER: OFCM’s requirement is for the Hotel to be ½ mile from a Metro subway station.

The Symposium is international in nature and attendees will not be familiar with the area and will most likely not use rental cars so hotel space is requested to be within ½ mile walking distance from a Metro subway station. The conference must fall within the month of June, 2004.  The dates proposed must not include any major holidays or major conflicting events. Space is required for Poster and Exhibit space. Offerors are required to bid the entire period of the conference

<DESC>This constitutes Amendment 0001 to N00178-04-Q-1006.  This amendment is issued to incorporate Statement of Work. NON-LETHAL OC/MALODORANT SPLASH DELIVERY ROUND Round Design / Fabrication (SOW) The objective is to develop a prototype 12-gauge splash round containing a non-lethal OC/Malodorant payload.  The contractor will be responsible for designing the round to meet all the design goals, fabricating 50 inert rounds with liquid payload matching the live round density for validation tests, and 50 live rounds for demonstration tests.  The final design should achieve the following goals: Compatibility: The round must be compatible with a standard pump 12gauge shotgun such as the Remington 870; Lethality: The round must be non-lethal at ranges greater than 20 yards with a maximum allowed kinetic energy of 58 ft-lbs; Penetration / Payload Dispersal: The round must penetrate a s ingle-pane of glass at 50 yards.  It is desired that the round passes through the glass intact and then disperses the payload on contact with a body or drywall.  However, it is acceptable for the round to not pass through the glass intact, as long as the content of the round passes through in its entirety.  The ability for the round to penetrate a double-pane of glass would also be advantageous. Containment: The round must safely contain the OC/Malodorant payload without any detectable leakage for a projected minimum shelf life of at least 1 year.  The payload will be a liquid organic mixture of Oleoresin Capsicum (commonly referred to as OC or pepper spray), mercaptans, sulfides, and possibly some amines.  The payload formula will be a government furnished item.  The contractor is expected to mix the payload and fill the projectiles on site.  The contractor will provide to the  government the encapsulated payloads for leakage testing;  Accuracy:  The round must be able to impact a 2 foot wide by 3 foot tall target at a range of 50 yards.  In addition to design of the round, the contractor is to develop the fill methodology and procedures necessary to load the rounds with both the inert liquid payload and the OC/Malodorant.  All drawings, designs, and procedures developed will be government property.  Each proposal should provide a complete cost breakout providing the basis for the price.  Three current/verifiable references should be included in the proposal.  All items are to be priced FOB Destination.

The Contractor shall create or have in place a graduated response/sanction regimen to address these infractions internally.  All program responses/sanctions to contraband or drug and alcohol use violations shall be discussed with the case manager no later than the next business day of the infraction and before any decision is made about the client’s continued participation in the program.

R- Internal Consulting/Relocation Services – U.S. Dept. of Commerce/BEA invites your company to quote on the following:

Introduction

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (hereinafter referred to as ABEA@), located at 1441 L Street, NW, Washington, DC is scheduled to begin its comprehensive carpet replacement and cyclical painting beginning in January, 2004.  

BEA occupies 140,000 net usable square feet.  BEA has ten divisions and 440 employees and approximately 40 non-agency personnel.  Of the 10 floors fully- or partially- occupied by BEA, approximately 81,000 square feet will be recarpeted.  BEA has 2 swing space areas which can accommodate 37 and 55 persons.  If needed, an additional area accommodating 15 workstations can be used for selected cycles.  BEA is seeking a Contractor to handle communication, management, and coordination for and between bureau and program management, employees, and vendors.  Timely project completion is paramount.

Background

To accomplish the recarpeting, BEA needs to move program units from their currently assigned location to swing space available within building number.  Careful planning and coordination are required to schedule the moves which cannot be accomplished within two weeks of releases.  It will take 4 to 6 weeks to complete a cycle.  BEA has approximately 54 releases involving staff from 10 different divisions.  Some divisions are being returned to their currently assigned space, others are moving to new locations which must be included in the plan.

The project must be managed to accommodate the various division work and release schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who shall coordinate set up schedule, coordinate activities between the program units, move Contractor, furniture Contractor, lessor, and Bureau management.

The project should be scheduled to finish in the Fall of 2004.

Project Dates

Immediately through Fall 2004.


Description of Work

Project Management


The Contractor shall manage BEA=s carpet replacement and cyclical painting project.  BEA management must be consulted and kept fully informed.  BEA employees must be directed through the process to lessen anxiety and maximize effectiveness of the project.  Effective communication with management, program leaders, and employees will be mandatory.

Develop a communication and management plan which will include substantive information on the procedure to be implemented to ensure effective and efficient management of the program.  The plan will include schedules, budgets, information for distribution to all groups, coordination tasks, and other items which will ensure a successful program.

Coordination of vendor activities

Develop a coordination plan including schedules by working with all contractor involved, including the moving company, rental furniture contractor, building owner/building management company, and other related contractors.  The coordination plan will identify all requirements for the contractors including schedules, instructions, conducting interaction between groups, and requirements for the vendors.  The plan will be implemented to ensure that all contractors perform with maximum efficiency.

Scope and Complexity

Because scheduling and coordination are critical to success, we have provided a list of releases and a chart showing the size of the program units.  These should be considered in the management, communications, and coordination plans.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR THE ASIA REGION”

PROJECT TITLE: CIVIL AVIATION SECTOR

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study(ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PROFILE

One project to be evaluated is a proposed second international airport for Sri Lanka.  One of the main reasons identified by GOSL for the great disparity in regional poverty levels is that the poorer regions are isolated from rapidly growing domestic and international markets.  Civil aviation also has a major role in tourism promotion and in transforming the tourism industry to attract a broader and better clientele and to increase the services offered to visitors.  The development of an integrated airport at Wellawaya, together with a host of other power generating projects, would be a catalyst to the further development of Sri Lanka’s underdeveloped southern region.

This proposed airport, which would be located approximately 87 nautical miles (nm) from Bandaranaike International Airport, could also be the nominated alternate airport for BIA.  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requires all international airports to have a nominated alternate airport sufficiently close to the main airport.  For BIA, the current alternate is Madras, India, located 350 nm north of BIA.  Aircraft operating to BIA are required to carry planned infrastructure development, including the development of a sea port, an oil refinery, and fuel to land at the alternate airport in the event that conditions at BIA preclude the aircraft from landing there.  The availability of a closer alternate will result in significant savings in fuel costs to user airlines and potentially increase revenues due to the increased payload capacity.  Estimated annual savings of $10 million would be achieved by airlines operating to BIA in view of fuel savings if an alternate airport is available in the southern region of Sri Lanka.  GOSL has sent a proposal for USTDA assistance with writing the RFP for this second international airport at Wellawaya.  It is expected that the project will be contracted on a turnkey basis with financing from one of the international financial institutions.  

Also to be evaluated is technical assistance related to the following projects:  
·	Private operation of Sri Lanka’s air traffic control and airspace management; 
·	The proposed privatization of BIA; and 
·	The opening of commercial helicopter operations in Sri Lanka – specifically the standards, practices, and regulations required, including those related to security.

USTDA funded an Orientation Visit for a delegation of Sri Lankan civil aviation officials in November, 2002.  The funding has yet to be utilized.  The DM contractor will help to define an OV delegation and an agenda and itinerary in line with what GOSL authorities require at this time.

<ARCHDATE>01222005
<CONTACT>Robert Milette Purchasing Agent 2083785110     rmilette@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Pacific Northwest Region, has intermittent requirements for video inspection of drain pipes at hydro facilities in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and portions of Montana and Wyoming.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify businesses interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  A review of contractors identified via an internet search as offering video inspection services and who are also registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) reveals that a variety of North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes may be associated with such services.  Some of the codes are 238220, Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors; 238990, All Other Special Trade Contractors; 541330, Engineering Services; 541620, Environmental Consulting Services; 561210, Facilities Support Services; 562991, Septic Tank and Related Services; and 562998, All Other Miscellaneous Waste Management Services.  Reclamation will not award contracts for specific tasks based on responses to this announcement.  Upon review of the responses, however, Reclamation may issue blanket purchase agreements under NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services, small business size standard $30 million.  If a sufficient number of small businesses respond, the BPA's will be reserved as a small business set aside.  Otherwise, the BPA's will be unrestricted.  Thereafter, requirements will be competed or awards rotated only among BPA holders providing service for the geographical area in which the hydro facility is located.  To be eligible for award of a BPA, contractors must be registered with CCR.  Registration is via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Video inspection services involve the use of remotely controlled video cameras capable of traversing under their own power various sizes of drain pipes at widely dispersed locations.  The size of the drain pipes range between four inches and 36 inches in diameter.  The length of the inspection runs are usually 300 to 500 feet, but a maximum run can be up to 1,500 feet.  The slope of the pipes can vary from nearly horizontal up to a five percent (5%) grade.  The inspection sessions shall be recorded on video tape in VHS or DV (digital video) format with audio notation of problems encountered during the inspection process.  Video tapes shall display a digital distance counter to document the length of travel by the camera inside the pipe. Written logs of the inspection sessions shall be generated also.  Deliverables shall include two (2) copies of the video tapes and two copies of the written logs.  Reclamation staff shall work on site with the video inspection contractor to help document activities and facilitate access to the camera insertion points.  Cleaning of the drains is sometimes required to allow camera access in pipes containing silt, sand and gravel materials.  Cleaning services shall be provided by the video inspection service vendor(s) either directly or by subcontract.  The length of pipe requiring cleaning can be up to 550 feet.   Respondents should submit a qualifications statement and identify the geographical area in which they are willing to provide service.  Submit responses no later than March 1, 2004, to Robert Milette, Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, 1150 N Curtis Rd, Boise, ID 83706-1234, telephone 208-378-5110, fax 208-378-5108, email RMILETTE@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>Request for Information
Systems Development & Integration (SDI)
 
SUBJECT: R—SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE 
INTRODUCTION:
The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research to identify organizations that have the technical capabilities to perform systems development and integration (SDI) activities in support of the USPTO, Office of the Chief Information Officer.  This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Industry responses, as a result of this announcement, shall focus on providing recommendations regarding the requirement and contract scope, contract type, performance incentives, best practices, etc.   Each recommendation shall include a complete description of the recommendation, why the recommendation is being put forth, how the recommendation may benefit the USPTO, and a discussion as to the pros and cons of the recommendation as it relates to the USPTO.   
The current SDM contract (which the SDI contract will replace) is a cost plus award fee/ performance based, task order contract and is a dual award with two large business prime contractors (Lockheed Martin Corporation and Computer Sciences Corporation).   The current contract term is one base year and seven option years.  In addition to Contract Line Items (CLINs) for labor services, included in the current contract are CLINs for the acquisition of incidental hardware and COTS software.  On contract type and incentives, the USPTO is looking for industry feedback on length of base term, total contract length and the use of award terms as incentives as well as recommendations related to various contract types, i.e. cost plus, fixed price or fixed price labor rate, solutions oriented/performance based, integration services, staff augmentation, etc.  The USPTO is also looking for feedback regarding the scope of the contract (see Reference Sources for a link to the current contract).  The USPTO is particularly interested in strategies for accommodating the anticipated process changes and utilization of new technology.  The USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this announcement.
A briefing with Industry to discuss this effort will be held on February 11, 2004 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, in the Patent Theater, 2nd Floor, Crystal Park 2, 2121 Crystal Drive, Arlington VA, 22202.  Companies wishing to attend must contact Janet Carlson or Anice Ogden via, e-mail (Janet.Carlson@uspto.go or Anice.Ogden@uspto.gov ) with company name, contact name, phone number and number of attendees by February 6, 2004.  For informational purposes, the USPTO will post the names of companies attending the RFI briefing to our acquisition web site.

BACKGROUND:  

The USPTO Office of the Chief Information Officer is responsible for the development, enhancement, and maintenance of the more than 120 application information systems (AISs) that are critical to meeting the mission and strategic goals of the USPTO and its customers.   In 1997 the USPTO awarded the Systems Development & Maintenance (SDM) contracts with the purpose of providing skilled staff, tools, and other resources necessary to undertake all phases of the USPTO’s system life cycle development.  The scope of work included systems design and analysis, programming, testing, customer training, implementation, transition to operations, system/software maintenance, project specific system/software engineering, business process
re-engineering, information engineering, product assurance, project management, and other related services.  Commercial off the shelf software products and incidental hardware were also part of the contract. 
SDI:  
The upcoming Systems Development and Integration (SDI) contract(s) will be the follow-on to the SDM contracts – to provide the highly skilled staff, tools, and processes necessary to develop, enhance, and maintain efficient and effective system and software solutions to meet the mission and goals of the USPTO, within the USPTO enterprise architecture (EA).  It is expected that the contractors will provide the technical and managerial resources to architect, design, develop, integrate, modify, maintain, enhance, reengineer, and/or provide specialized technical assistance for AISs that support USPTO business functions.  Services to be provide include, but are not limited to, requirements engineering, solutions architecture, systems analysis and design, programming, testing, implementation and integration, system/software engineering, process reengineering, information engineering, customer training, project management,  and other related services and products.  This contract will also be used to identify and acquire Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software applications or products that support the system development life cycle as well as incidental hardware needed for AIS development, maintenance, and enhancement activities.
The USPTO intends to use the information and recommendations provided from this RFI in the development of the SDI contract approach and to refine the statement of work.  Critical to the USPTO are contracting approaches and strategies that allow for flexibility in terms of the work to be performed and the ability to meet changes in technology.
The USPTO is evolving its applications architecture and software engineering to include, in part:  Linux, J2EE/JAVA, IBM WebSphere Suite (including the portal server, JAVA Studio Developer, and HTTP App Server), and Rational Unified Process.     
This acquisition will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) that provides significant flexibility from the FAR (see PTAG link below).

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is continuing to conduct market research to determine the availability of any commercial sources under the procedures prescribed in FAR Subpart 7.3 and OMB Circular A-76.  This notice is provided to (1) inform potential offerors of NASA's determination regarding the feasibility of making the NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) procurement a small business set-aside, (2) inform offerors of NASA's intentions regarding use of part 12 procurement procedures, and (3) provide a tentative procurement schedule.  Based on the information received in response to NASA's Sources Sought synopsis issued December 12, 2003 for the NSSC, we have determined that this procurement is not suitable for any type of set aside for small businesses.  Therefore, NASA intends to conduct this procurement using full and open competition.  Any potential offerors who believe they have this capability should submit their expressions of interest in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Those potential offerors that responded to the previous sources sought synopsis issued December 12, 2003 do not need to resubmit their expression of interest.	In order to facilitate teaming arrangements and subcontracting opportunities, NASA intends to publish in the near future the names of the companies who have expressed interest in the NSSC procurement.  Those potential offerors who wish to be excluded from this list should contact the Contracting Officer immediately.  Further, NASA does not intend to use part 12 procurement procedures for this acquisition.  Part 12 procedures are not suitable for this procurement action due primarily to (1) the length of the anticipated transition period (~2 years) and the anticipated level of government involvement during this period, (2) insufficient history of task workload data, (3) the uncertainties of creating a new organization, and (4) because many tasks to be performed do not meet the definition of commercial services as defined in FAR Part 2. Based on the rationale provided above, potential offerors are encouraged to comment on the feasibility of using part 12 procurement procedures for this action.  Only electronic submittals will be accepted. Any information submitted in response to this notice shall be e-mailed to: James.Becker-1@nasa.gov no later than 10:00 A.M. EST, January 30, 2004. The following tentative procurement schedule information is provided:  (1) release of draft acquisition plan for review/comment in Feb/March 2004; (2) release of draft solicitation for review/comment in May/June 2004; (3) final solicitation release in July/August 2004, and (4) selection in March/April 2005.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Please note THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS TIME.  Prospective offerors are responsible to monitor this web site for further information concerning this procurement.  Additional information about the NSSC may be found at the NSSC website at http://nssc.nasa.gov/.  The following information from the previously-posted sources sought synopsis is provided for convenience:  "The NSSC concept is to consolidate selected NASA business and technical services currently performed at ten remote NASA Centers to one location, in order to eliminate duplication, improve quality and efficiency, and lower cost. The final location of the NSSC site is currently under study. Site selection will be announced in a subsequent public release. NASA intends to conduct this acquisition using the Standard Competition Procedures as provided in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised), dated May 29, 2003. Further, the intent is to make one award to a single service provider who would be responsible for providing all of the technical and business services under study; NASA does not intend to make separate awards for each business and technical service under study. In general, the selected business and technical services under study are as follows: (1) Human Resources Services; (2) Financial Management Services; (3) Procurement Services, and (4) Information Technology Services. The study may be expanded to include additional services/functions as necessary. The type of work to be performed under each service area is summarized as follows. (1) Human Resources Services:  Personnel Program Support, Employee Development/Training Programs Support, Employee Benefits and Services, Human Resource Information Systems and Reports, and Personnel Action Processing and Record Keeping; (2) Financial Management Services: Accounts Payable (Payroll, Travel, Vendors), Payments Certification, Payroll, Time and Attendance, Labor Processing/Distribution, Accounts Receivable (Billing and Collection), Reimbursable Collections and Closeouts, Financial Reporting (General Ledger, Treasury 224, NF 1018s), and Internal Reviews for the NSSC/Finance Organization; (3) Procurement Services: Transactional Services, to include award and administration of NASA Grants and Cooperative Agreements, Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) contracts, managing a Procurement Workforce Training Program, and providing procurement electronic services; (4) Information Technology Services: provide NSSC IT support (e.g., web applications, local intranet, call center)."

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB) has a program of enabling electronic communications with countries that restrict their citizen's ability to access the Internet for independent and unbiased news and information.  The purpose of publicizing the above, as part of ongoing market research, is to solicit, review and comments from industry on this program.  No proposals are being requested or accepted under this Notice.  This market survey is to obtain feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope and alternative means that may be beneficial to BBG/IBB.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for any anticipated requirement is 514191 and the business size standard is $18.0 millions dollars.  BBG/IBB program presently consists of utilizing both email and web browsing tools to circumvent censorship imposed by select countries so that their citizens may access Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, Radio Farda and other sources of news.  The tools also allow access to any and all forms of electronic news, including established media websites, discussion groups, bulletin boards, and web logs.  BBG/IBB is seeking sources for developing more advanced techniques on bypassing the electronic censorship barriers imposed by select countries, including possible areas such as advanced proxies, Instant Messaging, Peer to Peer, SMS, and other protocols/formats.  BBG/IBB will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments when addressing a future requirement.  In addition to comments on the above program, those interested are requested to provide a budgetary estimate for any comments on this program.  Interested sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to this Notice.  Any submission of such product literature or "catalog cut sheets" will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation.  BBG/IBB will not pay for information or comment provided and will not recognize any costs associated with the submission of comments.  BBG/IBB, as noted above, is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the above-mentioned program.  Written comments shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), February 23, 2004.  Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Mr. Wayne Greene, Contract Specialist, Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau, Office of Contracts, Switzer Building, Room 2523, 330 "C" Street, SW., Washington, DC 20237.  Submittals may be made by facsimile to (202) 260-0855 or courier, however, telephone or email responses are not acceptable.  Please reference Market Research 04-001 on all correspondences.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources to provide maintenance on Fujitsu 9600 XL PBXs which are installed in Wilkes-Barre, PA; Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL and Kansas City, MO.  At the option of the Government, a site in Philadelphia, PA may be added at a later time.  SSA is looking for vendors capable of providing maintenance on these PBXs and the ancillary systems including Intellicenter, CallXpress, and a vendor patented system management solution (Site Man) at each site.  These services must be available on GSA Schedule.  The sites range in size from approximately 1,500 lines to approximately 2,500 lines.   All of the sites except Wilkes-Barre, PA require maintenance that will include the services of an 8 hour per day, on-site certified maintenance technician, in addition to 24 hour, 7 days a week remote diagnostic capability.  These technicians must be familiar with the technical requirements for analog trunks, T1 and PRI.  The Wilkes-Barre location will not require an on-site technician but instead will require 4 hour and 8 hour response time for repairs, depending on the severity of the outage, in addition to the 24 hour 7 days a week remote diagnostic capability.  Vendors and the proposed on-site personnel must be certified on the components listed above, but SSA will consider substitutions/replacements of any of the individual components as long as the replacement equipment matches the functionality of the existing equipment without any reduction in service capabilities.  All vendors will be expected to provide letters from all manufacturers, verifying both manufacturer certification and the vendor's ability to provide replacement parts as required for the systems to operate at optimal efficiency.  The vendors should be able to provide the names of at least three (3) existing customers utilizing configurations as described above.  The vendors must be certified to maintain current System Management Tool (Siteman), which provides the functionality to manage the PBX, Voicemail and Call Accounting System.  If the vendor is not manufactured certified to maintain and replace defective parts, the vendor must provide a like system to perform the following functionalities: Remote Alarm Monitoring, Cable Management System, Call Accounting Management, Inventory Management, Change Management, Work Order Management, Alarm Management, Disaster Recovery Management, Station Placement Management, Trunking/CO Management;  Reporting to Include: Departmental Usage, Work Order Usage, Trouble Ticket Identification, Toll Restriction Identification and COS Restriction/Enablement of permitted features.  The vendor must be certified to install upgrades and software enhancements to the current System Management Tool.  If the vendor is not manufactured certified to install upgrades and software enhancements, the vendor must provide a like system in functionality for which they are certified to install, upgrade and provide software enhancement for.  The vendor must have access to replacement parts for the current System Management Tool, which is deemed acceptable by manufacturer’s standards.  These replacement parts must be of equal or better quality standards.  If the vendor does not have access to replacement parts, the vendor must provide a like system in functionality for which they have replacement parts available.  The vendor must have access to provide debugging abilities to the current System Management Tool.  If a vendor is unable to provide this capability, they must provide a system for which they do have this ability.  Interested firms currently performing these services are invited to submit information in sufficient detail to the Contracting Officer.  The vendors should include corporate experience and provide three (3) references of customers receiving services on similar equipment.  The vendor should also provide technical literature, a copy of their GSA Federal Supply Schedule and other documents requested above.   This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources.  Responses to this notice should be submitted in duplicate within 15 days of this publication.  Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) is currently seeking sources for the assembly and manufacture of the BLU-97B/B submunition (Part Number 809420-70 and in accordance with Navy Munitions Data #NMD-189B Rev. G dated 29 Apr 2003) in order to determine if adequate systems engineering, manufacturing, assembly and test capability exists to support a competitive reprocurement in support of the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW-A) production program.  The effort would involve manufacture, assembly and testing of the BLU-97B/B bomblet in accordance with a Government provided Technical Data Package (TDP) using Government Furnished Material (GFM) in “as-is” condition in inventory at the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant and new manufactured parts.  The planned effort would also involve assumption of systems engineering responsibility for the BLU-97 design.  NAVAIR anticipates award of a competitive production contract for BLU-97B/B submunitions beginning in FY05 or FY06, including a base year and four years of fixed priced production options.  Production of BLU-97B/B submunitions is expected to continue through FY17 at a rate of 65,000 bomblets per year (not including potential FMS sales) or until the inventory objective is achieved.   The majority of the current BLU-97B/B components in GFM stores are only available through FY07.  The GFM inventory will be made available for inspection by potential offerors prior to submission of a proposal.  Additionally, as part of the competitive reprocurement, potential offerors must have the capability to redesign the BLU-97B/B submunition to eliminate hazardous unexploded ordnance (through self-neutralization or other means) and produce test articles to validate an engineering change proposal (ECP) to the Technical Data Package for insertion in future production should funding for the engineering change become available to the program.  Other key goals of the redesign effort will be to maximize use of existing GFM parts, ensure no degradation of existing BLU-97B/B performance, comply with MIL-STD-2105 and potentially MIL-STD-1316E (if significant changes to the fuzing are planned), and reduce life cycle cost for the BLU-97B/B submunition.    Interested parties are requested to reply by 31 August 2003 to Ms. Lori Frame, by email at FrameLA@navair.navy.mil and to arrange for a technical briefing that includes your company’s capability to produce the existing BLU-97B/B submunition design per the Technical Data Package as a prime contractor and capability to design a solution to eliminate hazardous unexploded ordnance.

THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes ? it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. 1.3 Interested parties are requested to provide a written response to this RFI.  Parties may include industry, government, and academic institutions. 2.0 Background. 2.1 The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a program managed by the Joint Program Manager for Information Systems (JPM IS) within the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD).  The mission of JEM is to merge DOD Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction modeling technologies into one common use DOD system. JEM will be capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accidents and/or incidents, high altitude releases, urban/littoral/coastal CBRN environments, building interiors, water borne hazards, infectious and contagious diseases and human performance degradation.  JEM will support defense against Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC), and Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) weapons, devices, and incidents.  Operationally JEM will support planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), to include weapons with CBRN payloads and TIM releases. JEM will reside on and interface with command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I), systems.  Warning systems on those C4I systems (e.g. the Joint Warning and Reporting Network, or JWARN) will use JEM to predict hazard areas and provide warning to U.S. forces within those areas.   Analytically, JEM shall assist DoD components, as well as allied or coalition forces, to train jointly; develop doctrine and tactics; and assess warfighting, technology, materiel development proposals, and force structure. JEM will operate in a variety of configurations, which include: 1.    Standalone 2.    Networked ? but not in the Common Operational Environment (COE) 3.    Integrated with JWARN and the COE A classified version of JEM will be developed to enable use of classified data.  An unclassified version of JEM will support homeland defense use by Civil Authorities.

<DESC>Request for Information/Sources Sought Subject:  Pedestrian/Bicycle Bridge, Murray Lock and Dam, Little Rock, Arkansas The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District, (LRD, COE), is seeking construction contractors with the capability of performing floating plant construction for the following construction project: pedestrian/bicycle bridge to be constructed over t he existing Murray Lock and Dam. The bridge would be the second longest pedestrian/bicycle bridge in the nation, and the longest such bridge constructed specifically for that purpose.   The concrete and steel girder bridge would be nearly 3,500-feet long and would also include more than 650-feet of mechanically stabilized earth wall.  The bridge would have a 14-foot clear width and be supported by single column piers.  The bridge is desig ned to support two 36-inch steel water lines to be installed in the future.  The vertical clearance would be sixty-five feet from upper pool two percent flow line to the low superstructure.  The bridge substructure will consist of single column piers const ructed on the existing dam spillway structure and on the north and south approaches to the dam.  Two piers will be constructed with concrete shafts drilled through the sloping downstream face of dam non-overflow monoliths.   The single column piers on the approaches to the dam will be supported on drilled shafts constructed in the powerhouse tailrace, and on either drilled shafts or piles with pile cap on the land based piers.   Information on the project can be found at:  http://www.swl.usace.army.mil/proj mgt/murraybridge.html The areas on the north and south sides of the dam include parklands and residential areas.  The area is frequented by fishermen, boaters, bicyclists, runners, walkers and other recreational users.  Precautions must be taken to protect members of the public  from injury and to minimize interference with recreational use of adjacent properties.  The estimated cost is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00 -- for a Firm Fixed Price Contract -- project duration is approximately 700+ calendar days. The Standard  Industrial Code is 1622 and the annual size standard is $17 million.  The NAICS Code is 237310. General Contractors should respond in writing no later than 29 February 2004.  E-mail responses are acceptable. This is an unrestricted procurement.  The written response shall provide the following information: bonding limitation, capacity, and current availability, the firm's dollar limit for bid guarantee/performance guarantee capacity, ability to obtain property  damage liability insurance of $1,000,000.00, provide a minimum of three references with same or similar type work that is currently in progress, or that has been successfully completed. This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal, announcement of a solicitation, or other obligation on the part of the LRD, COE.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE OPTICAL SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (OSAR) TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE OPTICAL SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (OSAR) TECHNOLOGY


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Optical Synthetic Aperture Radar (OSAR) technology.

Scientists at LLNL have developed an Optical Synthetic Aperture Radar (OSAR) concept, which has significant advantages over conventional Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in terms of platform/sensor and laser frequency stability requirements. Additional features that distinguish the concept from conventional SAR technology include the impact of atmospheric turbulence on image quality. Preliminary analysis and modeling investigations carried out to date show promising results. The objective of the commercial partnership is to develop and eventually license existing intellectual property. The partnership will include a comprehensive system analysis and modeling, followed by a demonstration of the technology. 

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Optical Synthetic Aperture Radar (OSAR) technology should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 64-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.
