<DESC>"The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory ("INEEL") is soliciting interest from companies actively involved in oil and gas drilling activities to assist in evaluating a novel drill string seismic source for use in pore-pressure prediction and/or seismic surveying while drilling.  The purpose of the joint collaboration is to evaluate the technical capability and the concepts of seismic data as well as pore pressure prediction acquired during drilling.  The developmental concept is able to utilize existing drilling hardware and would be powered by drill-mud flow.  The collaborative research may or may not include concurrent seismic receiver development.  Knowledge and experience in working with down hole equipment (i.e. motors, turbines, pumps, gearing, generators, & shafting) not normally associate with drilling would be beneficial.  If the development project is successful, the novel technology would be available for license to the party and/or parties providing funding and in-kind support.  Expressions of interest should be received not later than 11/30/2002."

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.

All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSAAdvantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.

<DESC>Synopsis: Construction Manager As Constructor (CMC) Services Contract for the proposed US Courthouse, Eugene Oregon.  The scope of CMC services under this proposed contract includes Preconstruction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services. Preconstruction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of design development documents, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, recommendations on phased construction, cost estimates, development of subcontractor and supplier interest, and identification of long-lead items. Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The CMC for this contract will be competitively chosen using Source Selection procedures. For this contract, technical factors will be given greater weight than price (represented by the CMC's fee for Preconstruction Phase Services, and Conceptual Estimate for the Construction Phase Services.)

The proposed US Courthouse will be constructed on a site located on a 4.5 acres at the corner of East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street, formerly part of the old Agripac cannery, in downtown Eugene.  The 278,400 square-foot building will house two District courtrooms, two bankruptcy courtrooms and two U.S. Bankruptcy courtrooms, chambers for six Federal judges, congressional offices, and space for the U.S. Marshals Service, probation and pre-trial services, federal prosecutors, court clerks, US Attorneys, US Trustees and other miscellaneous Federal offices. The project will include interior secure parking spaces. The maximum ECC (Estimated Construction Cost) is $65-75 Million. The building is composed of two basic elements: a rectangular plinth that offices parking and security functions on the basement level and two floors of administrative offices above; and three irregularly shaped pavilions that sit on the roof, each of which contains two courtrooms on the third floor level and a forth floor of chambers and ancillary judicial services.

Proposal Submission Requirements; Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Stage process. Under Stage 1, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past performance, and personnel. The Government will evaluate Stage 1 submissions to establish a Voluntary Short List (those firms considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award). 

Firms on the Voluntary Short List will be invited by the Government to participate in Oral presentations, followed by stage 2 submissions. Stage 2 submissions will consist of a conceptual estimate and pricing for Pre-construction phase services, and any other requirements stated in detail in the RFP. 

For those within the competitive range, the Government may enter into discussions before soliciting Best and Final Offers.  However the Government reserves the right to award the contract without discussions. 

Contract Award: A fixed price contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Preconstruction Phase services.  The price for Construction Phase services will be negotiated at a later date and should result in a fixed price award fee contract. 

SB - SDB Participation: Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities. Short-listed firms shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. 

An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve participation goals.

Stage I submittals are to be received no later than 3:00 PM PST on December 16, 2002.

Only technical submittals should be submitted. Price proposals will not be considered until the second stage of the source selection process. All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10. 

A pre-proposal conference will be held at the Eugene Courthouse (Jury Assembly Room) on November 21, 2002 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, followed by a small business/subcontractor networking session (from 3:30 to 5:00).  Additional details will be provided by amendment to this synopsis.

If you plan to attend either the pre-proposal conference or networking session, please register by sending an EMAIL to Pat.Brunner@gsa.gov.  In the email please the name and contact information for each person planning to attend.

Target date for posting the RFP to this site is November 13, 2002.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications - Commercial Items.  Access the FAR and DFAR at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/	 The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT ( ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offer ors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE informati on submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous pr oposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quali ty product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) and DoD, is seeking proposals (technical and cost) for research and development in the following areas: (1) microelectronics, (2) micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and/or (3) photonics technology. Proposals for research and development addressing the technologies that rely on heterogeneous integration across these three areas to achieve complex multifunctional systems capabilities in chip-scale packages are specifically included.  Such a system might include sensors/emitters, processors, power sources, clocks, etc., that might be designed to operate under difficult conditions.  Chem/Bio chips for detection of chemical or biological threats, chips that dynamically adapt to their environment, intelligent chips that filter sensor input from the outside world, or network centric enabling components are all representative of these areas of interest.  The tight coupling of lasers with highly integrated digital circuits for high bandwidth signal access to memory is another example.  These heterogeneously integrated chips are expected to aid in MTO's current goal to develop and exploit micro-scale sense and action amplifiers for the war fighter, establish battle space information channels with greatest bandwidth possible, and provide degrees of connectivity not possible with present technologies.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security.  New technologies and approaches to these issues are particularly encouraged.  Additional information on the programs within MTO is available within the DARPA web site (http://www.darpa.mil/mto). This announcement will be open through 01 November 2003.  Awards may be made at any time throughout this period.  Such awards will depend upon evaluations described below and availability of funds. The Government further reserves the right to issue contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-08.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purchase professional support services for the Center for Information Technology (CIT), NIH from Robert Lagas, 4300 Oaktree Road, Rockville, Maryland 20853.  The specific tasks will be included in the Request for Quote (RFQ).  The services will be for a period of 12 months with two (2) 12-month option periods.  Specifically, CIT requires the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of CIT's complex IT management activities who can successfully accomplish the following tasks: (1) Provide professional support services to the NIH Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Deputy CIO, (2) Provide assistance to NIH Institute and Center (IC) personnel and the Office of the Deputy CIO (ODCIO) in preparation of the IT systems (ITS) budget, (3) Provide assistance to managers of centrally funded IT systems in preparation of internal NIH budget requests, and maintain spreadsheets for the CIO and the IT Board of Governors (BoG), (4) Provide assistance to business managers and IT Investment Review Board (ITIRB) members during IT investment reviews, (5) Provide instruction and training to NIH personnel in the areas of IT Investment review, development of business cases, and preparation of cost-benefit analyses, (6) Maintain and enhance web sites relating to IT Management and Policy, specifically for implementation of the Clinger-Cohen Act, and (7) Perform other related professional/business support tasks as required by the Project Officer.  CIT has determined that Mr. Lagas possesses the unique combination of knowledge, skills, and understanding of CIT's complex IT management activities that are necessary to accomplish the specified tasks.  He provided specialized IT management expertise during the past nine years at NIH.  He has a total of 38 years experience in IT systems development, implementation, operations, and management.  He served seven years as the Director of the Office of System Management of another Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS) Operating Division (OPDIV), and served as the principal staff person for the Office of the Deputy CIO (ODCIO) for the past six years spearheading the NIH implementation of the Clinger-Cohen Act.  From 1993 to 1996 he participated in management control reviews of IT security and telecommunications activities in addition to developing policy documents and reviewing agency procurement requests for contracting authority for the acquisition of IT resources.  When the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), later renamed the Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA), was passed in 1996, Mr. Lagas assumed the staff leadership at CIT in the development of policies and procedures for the implementation the CCA.  He was the principal author of the Interim Procedures for Implementation of the CCA, the NIH IT Management Guide and the NIH IT Investment Review Process.  In the areas of guidance and training, Mr. Lagas was a leader in the development and presentation of CCA training for NIH IT personnel.  He was the principal author of the Cost-Benefit Analysis Guide for NIH IT Projects, which is used by other Federal Agencies as their guidance on Cost-Benefit Analysis.  He also developed sample Cost-Benefit Analyses with spreadsheets that provide a format for all the calculations for the analysis. For the past three years he taught classes at the NIH CIT Training Center on the IT Investment Review Process, the Business Case, and Cost-Benefit Analysis.  His reputation in this area led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request that he train their personnel in these areas.  He also provided specialized training to members of the NIH IT Investment Review Boards to teach them how to evaluate Business Cases and Cost-Benefit Analyses.  In addition, he has assisted business managers in the development of Business Cases and Cost-Benefit Analyses.  In the area of IT budgeting Mr. Lagas provided assistance to the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) in the preparation of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) exhibits 53 and 300 since 1999.  He was the primary designer of a spreadsheet used to monitor the centrally funded NIH IT systems, and was one of ODCIO staff members responsible for maintaining the spreadsheet. He assisted the business managers of those systems in preparing documentation for internal budget reviews and provided staff support to the NIH CIO and the IT Board of Governors (BoG).  CIT has determined that based upon his previous experience and expertise, Mr. Lagas will not require orientation to CIT's IT management activities, and is the only source with the unique qualifications who can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

<SUBJECT>63--Aircraft Self-Protection Security System
<SOLNBR>R464
<CONTACT>Roy Higgins Roy.Higgins@Hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office wishes to identify potential sources for an Aircraft Self-Protection Security System (ASPSS).  The ASPSS will be a portable carry-on security system to provide protection for various types of deployed aircraft.  It must be small, lightweight, and compatible with flight line operations.  It will have to provide all weather, worldwide application, with a controllable detection pattern.  Small RF based sensors will be required to provide 360o, 100 meter range capability to detect and track intrusions in areas around the aircraft.  It must detect human and vehicle targets during both day and night, without artificial lighting, and detect in atmospheres containing fog, smoke, haze, dust, and clear air.  Human target detection must include walking and running up to 100 meters and crawling up to 60 meters.  Vehicles must be detected up to 100 meters. False Alarm Rates/Nuisance Alarm Rates must be less than 3 per 24 hours.  The ASPSS is required to have a mobile hand held annunciation capability that provides alarm notification and intruder location relative to the aircraft.  The sensor to annunciator connectivity will be provided by an RF link with an operating range of up to 200 meters.  The ASPSS is required to accept rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries.  These batteries will provide at least 72 hours of operation without recharging or sensor battery replacement.  The ASPSS should weigh less than 50 pounds and be packaged in no more than two carry-on containers.  Estimated production unit costs should not exceed $10,000 per system.  To achieve the required performance, a development phase of not more than one year, resulting in testable production representative units, is acceptable.  <br><br> If required and determined to be in the best interest of the Government, the Government is prepared to fund approximately $1.0M of the development phase.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54171   The Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters Office in Washington DC is presently interested in soliciting request for quotes (RFQ) from vendors to analyze the operations of the U.S.-Canada International Joint Commission (IJC) to determine where and to what extent  those operations constitute a useful precedent for improvements in the institutional arrangements governing water management in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Particular attention will be paid to the management of water in the U.S.-Mexico border region in the face of global change (e.g., climate  variability and change; land-use change). Other transboundary river systems will also be examined. II.   Background More than 10 million people live in 14 sister cities in the U.S - Mexico border region. Unreliable potable water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater are persistent  environmental and public health problems.  Efforts to manage and protect the resources along the border date back decades, yet problems persist. International treaties and binational institutions were established in North America decades ago to administer transboundary water resources. But new  conditions have arisen in the border regions, threatening the shared water resources. Population and economic growth, new demands on water resources, and inefficient water consumption patterns have all helped to increase the gap between water supply and water demand in some areas and led to higher  pollution of water resources in others.  Due to the urgent environmental infrastructure needs in the U.S.-Mexico border region, Presidents Bush and Fox directed a binational working group to hold a series of discussions with states, communities, and other stakeholders in the border region to  develop recommendations designed to strengthen the performance of the North American Development Bank (NADBank) and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). The border between the United States and Canada is similarly crossed by numerous rivers and some of the largest lakes in the  world. The International Joint Commission assists governments in finding solutions to problems in these waters.  The 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty established the Commission, which has six members. Three are appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and approval of the Senate,  and three are appointed by the Governor in Council of Canada, on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Commissioners must follow the Treaty as they try to prevent or resolve disputes. They must act impartially, in reviewing problems and deciding on issues, rather than representing the views of  their respective governments. The Commission has set up more that 20 boards, made up of experts from the United States and Canada, to help it carry out its responsibilities. Of particular relevance to this project is the Great Lakes Water Quality Board, which is responsible for implementing the  1978 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  Annex 2 of the 1978 Agreement identifies specific "beneficial uses" that are to be protected through remedial Action Plans and Lake-wide Management Plans. Most recently, the Water Quality Board has been charged by the IJC Board of Commissioners with  assessing the potential impacts of climate change on the beneficial uses and potential adaptation strategies. This project is particularly timely given the high-level attention being paid to the shortage of water in the U.S.-Mexico border region and in particular to Mexico's water debt to the U.S.  under the 1944 Treaty.  Existing institutions with water-related responsibilities in the border region ? including the International Boundary and Water Commission, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission, the North American Development Bank, Mexico's National Water Commission, and U.S. state  and local water authorities ? need to do a far better job in prioritizing uses of scarce water resources, encouraging water conservation investments, and planning for the future in anticipation of global change.  Public and private sector experts on both sides of the border have identified  watershed management councils as an important tool to achieve these goals.  As the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation recognized at its recent Council meeting in Ottawa, the IJC provides an interesting model for the U.S.-Mexico border institutions not only because of its  creation of watershed management councils, but also because it has taken a more integrated approach to water quality and water quantity issues than its sister institutions to the south. The one limitation it shares with those institutions is the need to get public support from stakeholders and  increased resources from governments to achieve its objectives.  Accordingly, the project will also examine the IJC's successes and failures in obtaining that support and those resources and relevant lessons for the U.S.-Mexico border.  Scope of Work 	The Contractor shall conduct the following  tasks in accomplishing the objective of this purchase order: Task 1.	The contractor shall initially prepare a Request for Quotation (RFQ) that includes the proposed firm fixed price, with an indication of the breakdown of the level of effort and other items that comprise the FFP proposed.     The  contractor must address in their proposal how they are going to consider the use of secondary data to carry out this purchase order. Secondary data is defined as the review or use of someone else?s environmental or health data that were developed for a different purpose.  This includes the data  used from citations from the literature searches from hard copies and computer data bases. Task 2.	The Contractor shall consult with the CEC, the BECC, or representatives of EPA's Region 6 to ensure that the work envisioned would be useful and welcomed.  The Contractor shall revise the initial  statement of work to reflect the needs of the CEC, BECC, or Region 6 representatives. The Contractor shall present the Technical Project Officer (TPO) with a letter or email from at least one of the representatives attesting to the usefulness of the project. Task 3.

<DESC>The Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division under the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ms. Susan Wagner Jeffery of Las Cruces, New Mexico, for the professional services of the creation of a method for trusted specialists to make immediate editing changes remotely over the Internet for databases residing on Solaris and Linux systems while updating staff work from Windows or Linux computers.  This method must be able to handle different toxicological and environmental health data and be applicable to additional data systems without incurring extra licensing fees or extensive reprogramming.

Specifically, the contractor will: implement searching, editing and printing needs to handle special characters, multi-table, multi-field relations for toxicological and environmental health data; implement findings of task one to handle secure, single-user control of data over the Internet for the data; and generalize task two to retarget this system to other databases by non-specialist technical staff.

Ms. Jeffery has worked for NLM for 3 years ? from the time this project was envisioned.    Ms. Jeffery has been developing custom tools in this area for 18 years.  She is part of the founding development group, which created the Icon and Unicon programming languages.  Ms. Jeffery has been the sole developer of the SIS software now under development.  Further, NLM requires her support for the transmission and conversion of data from the current update system and the development of programmer and user training and reference manuals.  

Ms Jeffery has skills in formulating medical and legal databases questions in terms of VHL languages, specifically, Unicon. Ms. Jeffery has worked on SIS databases and has worked with WestLaw; she is the principal developer of wide-area update capabilities for Unicon applications through GUI code generators; she has worked with programming teams in private industry and in government.

Ms. Jeffery had demonstrated her ability to document both user and maintenance programmer procedures; design software supporting a high level of chemical and health knowledge which can be used for both advanced and neophyte users; analyze complex human medical chemical problems and present these with software context; and support of end users and programmers with diverse cultural, academic, medical and legal backgrounds.

Ms. Jeffery?s expert knowledge consists of internet database protocols and the way they are designed through modifications of implementation of the POSIX and ODBC standards to support wide-area networking; Unicon program language and its associated GUI-development tolls; medical and legal database environments; and text-based database per- and post- processing.

In addition, Ms. Jeffery has demonstrated the required experience with Windows, Linux, and Solaris platforms and with the MySQL database management system. She has previous experience with SIS database formats and files, such as NTIS, HSDB, and TOXLINE. 
This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm?s ability to meet the government?s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 03-003/SAN shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Susan A. Nsangou, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 nsangos@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6545.

<DESC>This presolicitation announcement is for informational and planning purposes only. On-going Engineering/technical support is required to align/calibrate equipment, to provide software engineering, and to assist in failure analysis and satellite communication diagnostics of the Single Channel Transponder System (SCTS). The SCTS includes the ICBM SHF Satellite Terminal (ISST) and the Single Channel Transponder Injection Subsystem (SCTIS).  This support is an on-going requirement from May 2000 through May 2005 to extend the life cycle of existing equipment. The SCTS mission is to relay Emergency Action Messages (EAM) originating from the president or his assigned representative to ICBM launch control centers. These systems are operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week due to the strategic nature of the mission. In addition, on-site formal operator/maintainer training in this system must be periodically provided. Prior in-depth knowledge and expertise with the existing system and a minimum Government Security Clearance of Secret are mandatory.  It is the Government's intent to increase the estimated value of the basic contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to allow support to continue through May 2005. ITT Industries, Communications Systems Group (CSG) 1460 Garden of the Gods Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 is the incumbent contractor providing engineering and related support for the SCTIS and ISST. The government does not anticipate any responses due to the following: The Government does not have much of the material or process specifications or firm interface documents or technical design data and none of the Level II manufacturing drawings, which would allow any source other than the incumbent to adequately support the SCTS system.  A substantial amount of proprietary technical data associated with this equipment will require licensing agreements with the development contractor, ITT Industries, Communications System Group, Colorado Springs, CO.  At this point in time, the responders are cautioned that the costs associated with the procurement of the necessary data and materials may make the effort unprofitable.  However, interested parties may submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC), demonstrating knowledge of the SCTS for consideration by the Program Management Office no later than Nov 22, 2002. The SOC shall not exceed 10 pages in length and shall contain enough information to determine whether or not the contractor is technically qualified. Information concerning this announcement may be obtained by calling Frank Gunton (Contract Buyer) at (310) 336-4784. NUMBERED NOTES: 22 and 26.

Responsibilities of the maintenance contractor include: data and computer software mapping, coding and implementing Medicare operational and policy determinations and enhancements, writing and testing Medicare Part B and DMEPOS software, developing and presenting Medicare Part B and DMEPOS technical training classes, providing help desk support on Medicare Part B and DMEPOS software maintenance and transition activities, supporting Medicare Part B and DMEPOS transaction processing and providing Medicare programming support activities.  The proposed modification will be for optional periods through 9/30/06.  This sole source modification is being conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, that only one responsible source and no other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.

This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  No solicitation is available.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence.  The Government will consider all responses received within ten days of the date of publication of this synopsis.

Each electronic form shall address only one technology or methodology and one topic. Separate forms shall be submitted for each additional topic or additional technology or methodology.  The submittal shall concisely describe the technology or methodology and shall be evaluated according to the CRITERIA stated in this announcement.  No additional data may be submitted for this BAA.  If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded.  Abstracts will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other.  A peer review board will evaluate the submittals to this BAA.  Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program.  Once accepted into the program, the abstract will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration.  Vendor submittals having a technology or methodology applicable to a specific environmental need may be asked to contract for a field application.  Multiple contracts may result.  THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE NAVY EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE OFFEROR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD.  The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following criteria (listed in descending order of importance):  The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the offer.

There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA.  As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NFESC will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek sites and funding.  Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects.  Any information that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted.  NAVFAC Contracts Office will reply to all offerors once the Navy's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) has reviewed all forms submitted.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is seeking sources to assist in conducting an independent compliance audit (presumed at this time to be performed using WebTrust SAS 70-Type II criteria) of its electronic commerce Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). An independent compliance audit of the DEA E-Commerce systems is needed to ensure CSOS and EPCS Policy Compliance and Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) Interoperability. 

DEA is building a Certification Authority (CA) and modifying its regulations to permit the use of PKI-based digital signature to bring the advantages of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce to the regulatory process. This process will allow controlled substance orders and prescriptions to be electronically transmitted using digital signature technology in lieu of paper processing and written signatures. This technology will be used in the Controlled Substance Ordering System (CSOS) and Electronics Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) Certification Authority. The CSOS provides manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers of controlled substances the option to digitally sign and transmit orders between trading partners, while EPCS provides for the electronic transmission of controlled substance prescriptions from practitioner to pharmacy. 

DEA has a requirement for specialized consulting /auditing services which will enable the agency to have a fully accredited Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solution. The prospective firm must be qualified to perform an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) audit and must be thoroughly familiar with requirements imposed on the issuance and management of digital certificates. The prospective firm must also perform such compliance audits as a primary responsibility. Interested sources should submit technical capabilities statements to Cynthia Miller, Contract Specialist that demonstrate their capabilities to provide the support being sought. The statement should not contain unnecessarily elaborate detail.  The Technical Capabilities should be no more than 5-10 pages in length.  Past Performance information may be furnished and if GSA schedule contracts/GWAC contracts are in place to solicit this type of support, you should include the contract no., point of contact (Contracting Officer) and telephone no. Any questions you may have should be submitted electronically or faxed to Cynthia Miller

The original contract was awarded for a six-month period.  A time extension of an additional two months is required to avoid a break in service while a formal five year contract is synopsized and awarded.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than November 21, 2002.  Affirmative responses shall reference TPD-IA-02-P-00065 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Governemnt. Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received by the close of business November 21, 2002, to the effect that a comparable service is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, a sole-source award will be made.  Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description: The National Park Service will be issuing a prospectus on Friday, November 8, 2002, to solicit proposals for providing medical services in Yellowstone National Park.  Proposals, including that of the existing concessioner, are due in the Business Resources Division, National Park Service, Intermountain Regional Office, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225 (Federal Express address: 12795 W. Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228, telephone 303-969-2661) no later than 4:00 p.m., December 13, 2002. Medical services are currently authorized under a concession contract between the National Park Service and West Park Hospital, Cody, Wyoming.  West Park Hospital does business in the park as Yellowstone Park Medical Services.  This contract expires by limitation of time on December 31, 2002. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR, Part 51, has determined that this is not a qualified concession contract and, therefore, no preferred Offeror for this contract exists. Services will require providing clinic and emergency medical services for park visitors and employees at two locations in the park's interior and a third operation, which is open all year, at park headquarters.  Requirements also include providing helicopter service for life-flights to medical facilities out of the park.  The National Park Service has determined that the contract term for this business opportunity will be for a period of ten (10) years. Copies of the prospectus can be obtained by contacting Edna Good, Chief of Business Management, Yellowstone National Park, Telephone (307) 344-2271.

The National Institutes of Health, DHHS plans to enter into a Multi-Award IDIQ Fixed Price Task Order Contract for medium to large projects encompassing new construction, alterations, repairs, and rehabilitation at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., the Animal Center in Poolesville, Md., and other associated locations in the Washington Metropolitan and Baltimore area.  The contract contains a base year period of 12 months and four potential consecutive option years, if exercised, for a total duration of 60 months. The contract will have a maximum aggregate contract ceiling of $300 million.  A minimum of $100,000.00 is guaranteed to each awardee within one year of contract award.  The maximum individual order limitation is $10 million and the minimum is $750,001.00.  The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, tools, and equipment for complete and total performance of the executed task orders against the contract.  The following conditions must be met for an offeror to be eligible for further consideration: (1) The offer must be deemed responsible, in accordance with the standards in FAR 9.1   (2) The offeror?s proposal must fully comply with all laws, regulations and the conditions set forth in this solicitation.   Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of management, technical quality or cost or price will be deemed indicative of a failure to comprehend the risks and complexity of the proposed contractual requirements herein, and will be rejected.  Among those offers satisfying the stated conditions, the Government will select the proposal representing the best-value and which will be most advantageous to the Government for the master contract as well as for the follow on task orders.

VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 

Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 
Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors? cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement.  The offeror shall present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 
Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 


VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The merit of the proposal shall be determined based on the following criteria listed in order of importance: 

(1) The Offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility and potential contributions of the effort to DOD priorities in RF Sensor related technologies; 

(2) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; 

(3) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; 

(4) Proposed cost, adjusted for cost realism; 

(5) The Offeror's past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort; and 

(6) Socio-economic merits (contracts only).  For awards to be made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service disable veteran-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI).  

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, Clarksburg, West Virginia, provides identification services based on fingerprints, and maintains a national criminal and civil history repository of fingerprint identification information.  Since July 1999, the FBI has performed identification services utilizing the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS).  The IAFIS is designed such that all fingerprint information will be processed electronically in a paperless manner.  The Card Scanning Service (CSS) is a contractor-operated conversion effort overseen by the CJIS Division.  The main purpose of the CSS is to convert paper fingerprint cards into electronic format for IAFIS processing utilizing the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS).  Textual information and fingerprint impressions are entered using optical character readers, manual entry and/or high-resolution scanners certified to comply with the FBI Image Quality Specifications (IQS).  The principle deliverables under the CSS are EFTS formatted messages containing the fingerprint images and textual data, which are transmitted to CJIS for IAFIS processing.  Currently CSS processes approximately 25,000 fingerprint cards daily.  The purpose of this request for information is to determine the existence and capabilities of competitive contractor sources for continued conversion services following the completion of the existing contractor CSS efforts.  A brief explanation of required services follows.  A full range of conversion functions may be required to accomplish this effort.  Conversion processing may begin after FBI receipt, basic Quality Control, pre-sort, inspection and turnover of fingerprint cards to the contractor.  The remainder of the conversion operation will be a contractor responsibility within a contractor-supplied secure facility in the geographical area of Clarksburg, West Virginia.  The CSS conversion processing may include sorting, inspection, quality control functions, entering textual information, and scanning of the paper fingerprint cards.  The paper fingerprint cards will be principally standard FBI criminal and civil fingerprint card formats, although other card types may also need to be converted.  CSS will produce and transmit to the FBI electronic records in EFTS format.  CSS will store the fingerprint cards until FBI identification processing is complete, and disposition instructions are received from IAFIS over a telecommunications link.  The CSS contractor will be responsible for all necessary labor, equipment, computers, scanners, printers, storage devices, supplies, consumable materials, and facilities to accomplish the conversion and transmission tasks.  A package of information is available upon request which will include the EFTS and sample fingerprint card formats.  Interested parties are requested to respond (AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT) with a capabilities statement if they have the capability and/or interest in the CSS effort.  The Government is specifically interested in determining industry capability to perform the CSS tasking with little or no development.  At this time, only prime contractor interest is solicited.  An original and three copies of responses shall be submitted within 30 days from the date of this advertisement.  Responses should be forwarded to Federal Bureau of Investigation, Information Technology Contracts Unit, Attn: Michael J. Young, Jr., Module B?3, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 26306.  NOTE: This advertisement is for information?gathering purposes only.  The FBI does not have a requirement for acquisition at this time.  If a requirement for the FBI results from the information gathered through this advertisement, the procurement will be handled in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

<DESC>NA The Corps of Engineers is compiling a list of SBA certified 8(a)/HubZone Firms that have the capabilities to provide the following contruction efforts for a future requirement:  the project would include the following features: (1) Extension of the existin g 4' by 8' concrete twin box culvert from Berry Street to Elm Street in Dover for a length of about 1,640 feet and the associated relocation of existing utilities; (2) Replacement of the two existing Rockaway Town Square Mall detention basin outlet structu res to reduce peak outflow rates and (3) Channel improvements (gabions) along approximately 150 feet of McKeel Brook to provide streambank stabilization. Seasonal restrictions will be a factor in scheduling the conduct of the work. Environmental windows wi ll limit any tree clearing activities to the period between March and November. Also, culvert work in Dover Township may occur only during the summer months when school is not in session.  The estimated Construction Cost Range of this project is between $5 ,000,000 and $10,000,000. The duration of the project is approximately 540 calendar days.  This compilation is necessary to enable the COE to determine if an available pool of qualified 8(a)/HubZonw firms are available to compete for this effort.  Interest ed firms are instructed to contact Ed Lew via e-mail at edward.t.lew@nan02.usace.army.mil, or on company letterhead, to Ed Lew, 26 Federal Plaza, CENAN-CT, Room 1843, New York, NY 10278-0090. and provide documentation that illustrates the firms capabilitie s and prior efforts that are similar to the subject construction effort.  This announcement does not imply that the Government is obligated to award this effort in the future.  All interested and qualified 8(a)/HubZone Firms are encouraged to reply.  Upon conclusion of the compilation, if the Government has determined that the qualified pool is not significant enough for a restricted competition, this requirement, if advertised, may be solicited as an unrestricted requirement.

<CONTACT>XDS13-12 (540) 653-7765
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for an upcoming Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) competitive acquisition for Vaneaxial Collective Protection System (CPS) Supply Fan Motors.  The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis unless two or more responsible small business concerns are identified, in which case the requirement will be set-aside for small business.  The applicable SIC code for this acquisition is 3621 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.  The motor procured under this acquisition will serve as a prototype motor replacement to the currently used Milspec certified motor with one that is more cost effective and more easily manufactured.  The Government anticipates procuring one motor each from up to three separate vendors that meet the requirements specified herein.  The current version of this motor is installed within the American Fa n Company Model Number A104 and A105 fans, which are used in a shipboard application as part of the Shipboard CPS Backfit Program.   The prototype motors must be able to meet three requirements for this acquisition: (1) The motors are required to meet the performance specifications detailed in MIL-PRF-24755A, dated 31 May 2001.  These are the approved Performance Specifications to which high-pressure Vaneaxial fans for shipboard use are manufactured; the motor specifications are described within this Specifications document.  A 15 Hp motor is sought for this acquisition.  Although MIL-PRF-24755A calls for a motor with a maximum of 20 Hp for installation within an A105 fan, continuing development of the fan has led to the requirement of only a 15 HP motor.  MIL-PRF-24755A is attached to this notice as a separate file; (2) The motors must be capable of being installed within the  American Fan Company (AFC) Model Number A105 fans. Interface drawing NV21015B provides the AFC fan dimensions within which the motors must fit and is attached as a separate document to this notice; and (3) Potential sources must be able to supply the required motors within 26 weeks after receipt of a purchase order.  Price will also be a consideration.  Potential offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, which addresses the following: (1) how their product meets the mandatory technical specifications and interface requirements detailed in MIL-PRF-24755A and drawing NV21015B; (2) applicable product drawings; (3) a listing of previous customers to whom the same or similar motors were supplied, the quantities supplied, applicable contract or purchase order numbers, and customer points of contacts and phone numbers; (4) the price of the motor(s).  In order to assist in the Gov ernment's evaluation of a competitive small business set-aside, potential offerors shall also clearly indicate their business status.  Due to the planned acquisition schedule, the Capabilities Statements shall be provided for evaluation, preferably in electronic form, to xds13@nswc.navy.mil, Attn: XDS13-12, reference quote number N00178-03-Q-3003, no later than 15 days after the date of this notice.  If electronic responses are not feasible, they may be provided via fax to (540) 653-6810, Attn: XDS13-12.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area, therefore the solicitation with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply Hard copies will not be provided.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD  website to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A SOLICITATION IS NOT
AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209) is conducting market research to determine the existence of potential business sources to develop a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant radio to replace the existing ARC-210 RT-1794 and RT-1824 radios. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source (Rockwell Collins) under the authority of  FAR 6.302-1. A determination by the Government whether or not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. An engineering change proposal to the existing firm fixed priced type contract is contemplated. The contract period is anticipated to begin in FY-04 with a two year period of performance and a priced LRIP option for deliveries beginning in FY-08. Engineering Development Models are required for platform integration testing in Oct 2005. The estimated quantity of production radios to be purchased per year is 500. The intent of this procurement is to expedite the migration of NAVAIR platforms to JTRS compliant radios by modifying the existing ARC-210 RT-1851 for JTRS Software Communications Architecture compliance and installing radios with JTRS capability (executing approved JTRS waveforms) equivalent to the existing ARC-210 RT-1851. This will enable the use of existing aircraft space and interfaces thus minimizing initial time and cost to integrate JTRS compliant radios. Critical requirements for this radio are that: 1) it retain the current ARC-210 interfaces (both software and hardware) to the current ARC-210 User platforms; 2) it be a form, fit, function replacement for the ARC-210; 3) be capable of running JTRS waveforms for all of the functions the ARC-210 currently performs, 4) be capable of multi channel operation, (Line of Sight power amplifier must be contained within the JTRS envelope; the Beyond LOS PA may be outside the envelope); 5) meet all of the JTRS ORD requirements except for number of channels, and operating frequency range (current ARC-210 band only); 6) be extendable to the full JTRS frequency range requirement of 2 MHz to 2 GHz via modular upgrades. Contractors must demonstrate: 1) a track record of developing tactical air radios; 2) capability to develop JTRS hardware and software for eventual full ORD compliance; 3) experience with integration of radios on tactical air platforms.  Interested parties may submit a capabilities statement that addresses their firm's previous experience in the production of similar types of radios at the production rate indicated herein.  The capabilities statement shall not exceed 10 pages in length, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum and shall be submitted within 30 days of the date of publication of this sources sought announcement.  The capability statement package shall be sent to the following address:  Naval Air Systems Command, Contracts 2.4, Attn:  Becky Wathen, Bldg 2272, Rm 256, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD  20670-1547 or by electronic mail to WathenBJ@navair.navy.mil.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<SUBJECT>B--Laboratory Analysis
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water seeks to procure, on an other than full and open competition, analytical support services for a single sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry  Products Industry from a single source.  The single source is  Pacific Analytical, Inc. (PAI), 6056 Corte del Cedro, Carlsbad, CA 92009.  PAI  is  the only  laboratory  currently with the demonstrated capability and experience in analyzing samples by the required  methods (and associated method modifications that are specified in the SOW) and reporting data electronically in accordance with the EPA-specified  format . EPA requires analysis of approximately 22  industrial wastewater samples, 3 matrix spikes, and 3 matrix spike duplicates  for pesticides/herbicides  by various EPA methods to include 632.     EPA will use the analytical data provided under this purchase order to develop industrial effluent discharge regulations that govern the disposal of pollutants  from Meat and Poultry  Products Industry sources;  therefore, data produced under this purchase order must be of highest possible quality.  Laboratories will be required to employ a comprehensive quality assurance program, meet facilities and equipment requirements, and provide  personnel that demonstrate technical expertise in analytical chemistry techniques. 

The sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry Products  Industry, Episode 6493, is scheduled to be collected during the week of  December 9, 2002.   It is anticipated that samples will arrive at the laboratory each day from Tuesday,  December 10, 2002 through Saturday,  December 14, 2002.  The laboratory is required to meet a 30 day data turnaround from receipt of the last sample associated with Episode 6493 at the laboratory, unless dilutions and/or reanalyses are required.  If dilutions and/or reanalyses are required, the data turnaround time for the entire data package will remain at 30 days.  The laboratory must adhere to extraction and analytical holding times as stated in the methods.  PAI  has a minimum of  five years of  experience analyzing for  pesticides/herbicides parameters using the required EPA methods, and has Method Detection Limits (MDLs) and Initial Precision and Recovery (IPR) data on-file at EPA.  Start-up tests requiring significant time and effort would be required from other labs.  Analytical conditions of the instrument must be adjusted so that undistorted spectra are produced.  Further, other laboratories would need to invest significant time and effort in developing the necessary data delivery software to submit data electronically in the format required by EPA.  The process of new laboratory start up would also involve a significant expenditure of EPA resources (at least 80 hours) to bring the laboratories up to speed.   EPA requires these services within four weeks' time.  This time would be insufficient to bring any other laboratories "up to speed" and ensure that EPA would receive the high quality data needed to support effluent guidelines regulatory development for the Metal and Poultry Products  Industry.  This procurement is being conducted   under the simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and other than full and open competition in accordance with (41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1)) and FAR 6.302-1 . This notice of intent is not a request  for competitive proposals.
