<DESC>The US Army Contracting Center-Warren intends to award a sole-source<br>contract to General Dynamics Land Systems(GDLS), Incorporated, 38500 Mound Road, Sterling Heights, Michigan 48310-3260 for the following requirement.<br><br>Hybrid Vehicle Reliability Testing Utilizing the Reconnaissance Surveillance and Targeting Vehicle (RST-V) - Phases I-III<br><br>1.  OBJECTIVES<br>The RST-V vehicle is a hybrid electric vehicle utilizing in-hub electric drive motors.  Originally developed by GDLS under contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) starting in 1996, the RST-V was designed to be air transportable in a V-22 Osprey, and as such the concept included a unique folding suspension system and height control that enabled it to fit into the V-22 cargo space.  <br><br>1.1 Phase I Procure Spares, Inspect and Repair Vehicles: The contractor shall procure long lead items, including vehicle battery packs and spares.  The intent is to procure material required to complete 20,000 miles of durability and reliability testing. GDLS shall perform an inspection and any necessary repairs of the vehicle systems for RST-V #3 and #4, to ensure vehicle readiness for testing.<br><br>1.2 Phase II Final Assembly and Checkout of the two RST-Vs: The contractor shall complete a final refurbishment of RST-V #3 and #4, checkout and verification testing of vehicle operation.   Hardware and electrical safety shall be inspected and repairs made appropriately prior to the start of the reliability testing.  The RST-V #3 and #4 shall be assembled and system operation checkouts as well as improvements to the E-Drive control system to optimize the fuel economy of the vehicle shall be completed.  Detailed inspection of all components shall be carried out and documented. <br><br>1.3 Phase III Reliability Testing: The contractor shall use the RST-V to conduct vehicle reliability testing consisting of 20,000 miles of durability which is currently estimated to take 200 days. In addition to the durability testing, the fuel economy shall be evaluated and recorded under various test conditions. All relevant data such as terrain, temperature and weather conditions shall also be recorded.  All Test Incident Reports (TIRs) shall be documented and qualified as being related to either the hybrid electric or the mechanical drivetrain. Testing shall be performed at a Proving Grounds mutually agreed upon by the Government and the contractor.  Probabilistic reliability analysis will be performed to include the following:<br><br>1.3.1 All TIRs to be used for reliability analysis <br><br>1.3.2 Utilize physics-based models to analyze reliability drivers<br><br>1.3.3 Perform targeted testing to properly determine enhanced reliability estimate<br><br>1.3.4 Use Bayesian statistics to update reliability expectations<br><br>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  GDLS is the only known source that can fulfill the Government's<br>requirement.  As the only manufacturer of the RSTV, GDLS has proprietary information and software essential for conducting the reliability testing required by the Government<br>.  <br>Interested persons may identifytheir interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the <br>Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information<br>received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining<br>whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br>All interested sources must respond not later than 21 Jul 2011,<br>4:00 PM EDT.

1.  Basis for Award:  The Government plans to award a single firm fixed price purchase order as a result of this Request for Quotation (RFQ). The evaluation of quotes shall be conducted based on the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government as reflected by the evaluation actors established below at #3.  Careful, full and impartial consideration will be given to all proposals received in response to the contemplation letter, and the evaluation will be applied in a similar matter. The government will weigh the relative benefits of each proposal, and award will be made based on an integrated assessment of the  technical (capability of item(s) offered to meet the government need), and price which will be most advantageous to the government. Under this evaluation approach of Best Value, a quote capable of Part H of the technical requirements above will receive additional credit for exceeding the established minimum defined requirements of technical acceptability. However, a quote capable of Part A through G of the technical requirements above will still be found capable to compete. Therefore, the government reserves the right to award to other than lowest priced offeror or to other than the highest technically rated offeror. 
1.1 Discussions: The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial quote should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.
2. Areas to be Evaluated:  The government will weigh the relative benefits of each proposal, and award will be made based on an integrated assessment. The order of importance for evaluation is (1) Technical and (2) Cost. 
3. Evaluation Approach: Careful, complete, and impartial consideration will be given to all quotes received pursuant to this RFQ. A team of Government personnel will evaluate each quote in the areas described below.
In order for a quote to be deemed acceptable it must meet all of the following minimum criteria:  Offerors must submit a quote for a quantity of one (1) re-circulating chiller that at a minimum meets Part A through G of the technical requirements and capabilities above. 
(1)  Technical: The technical portion of the quote will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on assessment of the stated minimum requirements below. These items are deemed critical to meet the Governments requirement. If any one of these requirements is rated as unacceptable this will result in an overall technical rating of unacceptable and the quote will not be considered any further.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection Procurement Process, Subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a contract to JVN Communications, Inc., Absecon, New Jersey  to provide the Air Traffic Organization - Terminal Field Operational Support (ATO-TFOS) with FAA Inter-facility Radar Simulator (FIRS) Platform upgrades to existing Stand-alone Inter-facility Radar Simulator (SIRS) and Rack-mount Inter-facility Radar Simulators (RIFRS) used in Standard Terminal Automation Radar System (STARS) and Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS) air traffic control test laboratories.  These upgrades include servers and/or standalone processors, user licenses and training of Simulation Driver Radar Recorder (SDRR) Graphical Scenario Generation Tool (GSGT), Random Access Plan Position Indicators (RAPPI) Airspace Visual Display (AVID), Inter-facility Shadow (IFShadow) and JVN Flight Data Input/Output (JFDIO) platforms.  
JVN Communications Inc. owns intellectual property rights to all FIRS applications and device drivers.  FIRS was developed by JVN Communications, Inc. to perform and support Automation Radar Tracking Systems (ARTS).   FIRS is also used at test systems located within the William J. Hughes Technical Center and Operational Support Facilities (OSF) within the FAA National Airspace System (NAS).  FIRS provides a Graphical User Interface-based presentation that accelerated the development and accuracy of test scenarios by providing a visual presentation that can be validated against test expectations during scenario development.  It accepts inputs scenarios from STARS ATCoach and CARTS Enhanced Target Generator and exports them to Simulation Driver Radar Recorder input files that can be used to test the system in near-real-time environments.  These FIRS characteristics allow the OSF's to produce and deliver error free air traffic control software. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above required work, and the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Michael Vazquez, not later than 1:00 p.m. local time, July 11, 2011.  Responses shall be sent via e-mail to michael.vazquez@faa.gov

<DESC>MSC will be issuing a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following services;
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The Engineering Branch (N7) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) is requesting engineering support to conduct a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analysis of an optimized bulbous bow shape for the T-AKR 310 Class WATSON. The actual operating profile for the T-AKR 310 Class ships does not match their design operating profile. The ships frequently operate at drafts less then full load so that the existing bulbous bow is partially above the waterline. A study was performed to compare the difference in resistance between the existing bulbous bow, a modified bulbous bow, and a conventional "bulb-less" bow under these operating conditions. This study showed that a modified bow could provide operational cost savings.</p>
<p>2.0 Scope of Work</p>
<p>The task will consist of a CFD analysis to analyze the existing bulbous bow and compare it to a modified bulbous bow. The modified bulbous bow will be optimized for a common operating condition and then compared to the existing bow over a range of speeds, drafts and trims. The goal of this task is to identify the optimum bulb shape that produces the greatest increase in hull efficiency when compared to baseline under the most common operating conditions.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award on a non-competitive basis purchase order to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA, 94404-1128 for the purchase ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. The ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system is a high performance instrument designed to optimize research productivity.  The PCR system helps streamline genomic screening and validation, pathogen detection, and biomarker identification and screening.  It facilities a straightforward method for gene expression profiling, high sample throughout genotyping, validating microarray results, and performing expression based biomarker screens.  This system is ideal for validating complex disease associations, marker-assisted breeding, or other studies requiring large sample sizes. The use of a real-time PCR System with the sensitivity and accuracy of the ViiA 7 has become essential to investigating and understanding the biology of viral infection in human cells.  NINDS will use this PCR system to examine changes in human cell gene expression due to infection with Human T cell Lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I).  The system will be used to investigate how potential treatments for clinical trial affect the expression of viral genes and viral-induced genes in infected cells.  The ability to monitor gene expression is essential to studying new compounds with the potential to treat patients with various viral infections.  This real-time PCR will also be used to scan large numbers of human and non-human primate samples for the presence of viral infection including infection of HTLV-1 as well as herpes virus.  

Applied Biosystems is the sole manufacturer and vendor of the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System.  Applied Biosystems does not have any authorized agents, distributors or dealers in the United States or Canada for the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. No other known equipment meets NINDS specifications.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR Part 12 procedures and exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2126465 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist or email at Snoddyj@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>1.	 This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies available in the next one year to provide new or enhanced power amplifier (PA) linearization methods for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) weaponry.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) is interested in reviewing the state-of-the-art and emerging technologies application to PA linearization techniques and architectures.

2.	The objective of this request is to identify broadband, high dynamic range approaches to PA linearization across the electromagnetic spectrum from the VHF to millimeter-wave frequency range.  Quantitative, case-specific measures of a technique's linearization effects such as third-order-intercept augmentation, increased power amplifier efficiency, and increased spur-free dynamic range are of interest.
  The salient strengths and weaknesses of each technique, especially as related to low size, weight, and power (SWaP) implementation, are also of particular interest.

3.	Background:  Recent advances in digital technology allow for extremely broadband, low SWaP signal generation in jamming systems.  However, the extremely broadband potential of new signal sources is not well-complemented by current PA technologies.  In spite of significant advances in tube, hybrid and solid-state PA technologies, Pas are generally the "bottleneck" component to a system in terms of bandwidth, added distortion, and SWaP considerations.  Recent advances in the field of PA linearization hold promise in significantly improving on all three of these parameters for specific PA architectures.

3.1	Department of Navy applications for this technology include, but are not limited to, standoff jamming (electronic attack) and self-protect jamming (electronic protect).

4.	Information desired:

4.1	Technical approaches and system concepts to perform PA linearization and the technical maturity of the approaches and concepts.

4.2	The size, weight and power, processing and radio frequency and circuit requirements and open architecture characteristics of the approaches.

4.3	How linearizer algorithms and hardware can be integrated with existing transmitters systems.

4.4	Methodologies from which linearization methods and system performance can be quantified and verified (measures of effectiveness (MOEs), standards, comparisons against conventional techniques, etc.).

4.5	MOEs of the linearizer on arbitrary external input signals.

4.6	Impact of varying transmitter load characteristics, including aperture effects, upon the linearizer performance.

4.7	Linearizer operation impact upon signal characteristics, e.g.
 doe the linearizer impart a modulation upon the signal.

4.8	Impact of transmitter blanking upon the linearizer operation.

4.9	System delay, insertion loss, instantaneous bandwidth and power handling.

4.10	Methods for linearizing Active Electronically Steerable Array transmitters.

5.	This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR Subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.

6.	Submissions will be considered up to and including SECRET.
  Companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of classified responses.  Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies regarding the generation, storage, handling, and delivery of liquid oxygen (LOX) to the end using hardware from both shipboard and/or from waterfront structures.  NAVFAC ESC is seeking to identify qualified sources which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Navy and Marine Corps operations through the development of such systems for supporting the at-sea operation of fuel cell powered Navy hardware.  Whether or not the various processes from the production through delivery of the liquid oxygen product to the end using hardware are conducted shipboard, or from a waterfront structure, will depend upon many factors, including the specific hardware type, the concept of operations (CONOPS), and the operational tempo (OPTEMPO).
  At this time, the Navy does not want to artificially preclude any potential solutions, and therefore is seeking technologies and methodologies that are applicable to being conducted from either shipboard, or from a waterfront structure, or from both.         

The term shipboard environments is meant to encompass operations from Navy, Military Sealift Command (MSC), and commercial platforms.  The term waterfront structure is meant to encompass the various facilities that support the naval mission such as berthing facilities that support ships and craft (e.g., piers, and wharves). The term LOX delivery systems is meant to encompass equipment and methods to deliver the LOX to the fuel cell/using hardware (end user) and potentially include mobile LOX carts to transport the LOX product from the producer to the end user; and piping, tubing, and/or hose systems for LOX transport from the producer or cart to the end user.
          

To be eligible for consideration and possible contract award, the technology or methodology shall be in either basic research (Category 6.1), applied research (Category 6.2), advanced technology development not for a specific system/hardware (Category 6.3A.  Furthermore, the technology or methodology shall address the performance areas cited in the attachments.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems in Tewksbury, Massachusetts for the production of two (2) AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Groups and two (2) Fire Control System (FCS) MK 99 equipment sets in support of DDG 116 and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #1 (HN-1) and associated engineering and technical services in support of production efforts.   

The anticipated contract actions will provide for delivery of two (2) of the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 Mod 14 equipment sets for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1.  Raytheon IDS will also be responsible for related technical services to facilitate system testing, shipyard installation, and other requirements.
  The Transmitter Group consists of Radio Frequency (RF) driver and amplification cabinets, an RF monitoring cabinet, high voltage power supplies, and isotransformers. The transmitter group provides high power RF energy for use by the radar to support its primary function of target detection and tracking.  The transmitter group also supports the generation of the missile data link for communication with missiles while in flight.  The FCS equipment set consists of Continuous Wave Illuminator (CWI) elements, waveguide elements between the transmitter and antenna, and the data conversion cabinet.  The FCS CWI elements provide high power, stable RF energy to support semi-active missiles in the terminal phase of flight.
  After production, the Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 DDG 116 shipset will be shipped to the Production Test Center (PTC) for integration with the remainder of the AWS and system level testing by Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2).  The HN-1 equipment set will be delivered to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) for deckhouse integration and system level testing.    

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Raytheon IDS is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys and Missile Defense Agencys (MDA) requirements for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group, FCS MK 99, and related technical services.  Raytheon IDS is the current and only qualified source as the manufacturer, assembler, and design agent for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99.
  The company is responsible for completing Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) equipment at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) and all AWS new construction requirements related to this equipment for those DDGs still within the SCN window (DDG 107 and DDG 109 through 115) and related back-fit requirements for CG/DDG Class ships.  Raytheon also develops configuration modifications which serve as the foundation for all forward fit changes or upgrades to new construction DDGs and the AAMDS.  Raytheon has been the prime production contractor for the AN/SPY-1 Transmitter Group since the first contract was awarded for the AWS effort in 1969.  As the design agent for the FCS MK 99, Raytheon has also been the principal subcontractor to LM MS2 for past transmitter and FCS modification developments.
 Under separate contracts, Raytheon IDS is developing transmitter group and FCS upgrades for the Aegis AMOD Upgrade (AAU) program and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) baseline 4.0.1, all of which will be part of DDG 116 and HN-1 AWS configurations.  Raytheon IDS is the only existing source that has the specific production engineering background, extensive integration and test facilities, prior FCS MK 99 and AN/SPY-1D(V) transmitter group experience, and in-depth technical expertise to produce the equipment without adverse impact to scheduled AWS deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding, and ship deployment requirements for operational use, and the Aegis Ashore programs Initial Operational Capability (IOC).
  

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and MK99 Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) for DDG 116 and HN-1 to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly. 

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Please review the above description and all comments and questions should be submitted in writing electronically to Ms. Jennifer L.
 Thompson, Contracting Officer, via email at jennifer.l.thompson1@navy.mil in lieu of telephone calls.  Do not phone in any questions or comments, they will not be considered.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey (NJ) for the procurement and integration of two (2) Aegis Weapon Systems (AWS) in support of DDG 116 and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #1 (HN-1), and associated engineering services in support of production efforts.

The anticipated contract actions will provide for delivery of two (2) AWS equipment sets, one each for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1.  The AWS shipset for DDG 116 will include production of selected equipment and integration and system-level testing of the AWS at the Moorestown, NJ Production Test Center (PTC).
  The AAMDS HN-1 equipment set includes the production of selected equipment and cabinet and sub-assembly level testing of the equipment.  Once this testing is complete, LM MS2 will deliver the HN-1 equipment set to MDA as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  LM MS2 will be responsible for production and fabrication of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays (4 per shipset), including an integrated Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP), Aegis AMOD Upgrade equipment (AAU), and Combat System Support Equipment (CSSE) for each equipment set.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for integrating the DDG 116 Fire Control System MK 99, including the MK 82 Directors and MK 200 Director Controls, and the AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Group delivered under separate contracts into the AWS and performing full functional testing of the complete AWS at the PTC.
  Once AWS system level testing at PTC is complete, the DDG 116 AWS equipment set will be delivered to the shipyard for installation into the ship.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for system engineering and technical services in support of the manufacturing process and ship integration, industrial level testing, and sea trials.

LM MS2 is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys  requirements for delivery of a complete, fully functionally tested AWS shipset for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1 including production of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays, MMSP, AAU and CSSE.   LM MS2 possesses unique experience in AWS design, development, production, assembly, and testing, and currently provides the necessary services to deliver an integrated and tested AWS to the fleet.
  LM MS2 also provides installation material, ancillary equipment, provisioning items, administrative data, technical data, and provisioning technical data.  As such, LM MS2 understands the system functionality and detailed specifications in order to produce systems that satisfy the AWS requirements and are compatible with existing components and infrastructure of the entire Aegis Combat System (ACS), of which the AWS is one component.  All previous AWS production contracts for shipsets and AAMDS equipment have been awarded on a sole-source basis to LM MS2 (or its antecedents).     Under these contracts, LM MS2 has developed an extensive infrastructure at its Moorestown, NJ facility to support AWS production.
  This infrastructure (production facilities, qualified supplier base, special test equipment, data networks, system test environments, producibility engineering workstations, etc.) also supports the separate LM MS2 contractual responsibilities for Aegis development, FMS AWS production, U.S. Navy and FMS in-service engineering, and other depot operations.  Because this infrastructure supports other ongoing contractual responsibilities, the Navy could not transfer it to another contractor for performance of these requirements.  LM MS2 is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources, and infrastructure to produce, integrate, and test the AWS without adverse impact to deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding schedule and ship deployment requirements for operational use, and the Aegis Ashore programs initial operational capability (IOC) date of 31 December 2015.

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for production, integration and test of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDG 116 and HN-1 to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to post a request for proposal for Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) X-band Radar requirements.  Requirements will cover base year Engineering Studies, with options for Engineering and Manufacturing Development, Engineering Services, Long Lead Material, Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Provisioned Items Order (PIO).  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued Quarter 4 of Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.  The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed.  Interested offerors should monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation.  Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.
  If the Government makes the decision to proceed to the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase, the EMD option will be exercised following the AMDR Program Milestone B decision.

AMDR is envisioned as a radar suite designed to be scalable to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar (AMDR-X) and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications.  The AMDR-X will provide horizon search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC.
  The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, AMDR-X, and combat system.  The RSC will perform all coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert in a widely diverse environment.  This solicitation will address the AMDR-X Engineering Studies leading to entry into EMD.

IMPORTANT:  In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. primes contractors.  The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S.
 Department of State. 

There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation.  These classified documents will be supplied on a CD/DVD which will be mailed separately.  Only one copy of the classified CD/DVD will be distributed per cleared pre-solicitation notice respondent.  To obtain these classified attachments, interested offerors must completely fill out the Classified Material Request Form which is attached to this pre-solicitation notice.  This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to john.butto@navy.mil and erica.l.bowling@navy.mil.  Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD/DVD to the respondent if a solicitation is issued.

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.
  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Disclaimer:  This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.
  This is not an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

<CONTACT>Adam Ball 757-443-1439
<DESC>The Contracting Department, NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center Norfolk, Norfolk, VA, 23511-3392; intends to negotiate a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price pricing provisions and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  

This requirement is to provide readiness and metrics support to the Warfare Enterprises (WE), which was formed to provide support to Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) and Surface Warfare Enterprise (SWE), along with any other enterprise that will receive support for readiness metrics development and analysis via this vehicle.  The enterprises are composed around specific war fighting domains and their primary providers, working across existing stovepipes, or functional commands, to ensure ability to meet the war fighting mission at the lowest possible price.
  The primary goal of the enterprise construct is to work collaboratively within a partnership of operators, resource sponsors, and providers to establish a culture of continuous process improvement to optimize the war-fighting readiness of all forces, while generating the greatest possible efficiencies.  To maximize Enterprise performance, the key attributes of an Enterprise must exist:  (1) consistently apply cross-functional process thinking; (2) establish and maintain process discipline; (3) utilize a set of consistent, integrated, and hierarchical metrics; (4) ensure full and consistent transparency of data, information, and activities; (5) establish and maintain accountability for actions and results; (6) apply an integrated governance structure; and (7) maintain a focus on total ownership.
  Top level processes in enterprise management include, for example, current readiness, supply chain management; future readiness, acquisition and procurement; both current and future total force requirements; and enterprise financial management and metrics.  The enterprise framework is about change management and forging a path to an affordable future for the Navy, as we continue to deploy a combat-ready Navy today.

A complete RFP package will be available on or around 05 AUG 2011 by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Place of Performance will be east coast, west coast, and potentially Hawaii.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and the Size Standard is $7.0M.
  This prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) will be processed utilizing Full and Open Competition, and will contain a required Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

The resulting contract will be for the period of a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) twelve month option years along with FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
 Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  

NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic Hazards Science Center (GHSC) has entered into an agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to support and assist the NRC in reviews of site license applications for nuclear power plants.  In coordination with the USGS-GHSC, the Pacific Coastal & Marine Science Center (PCMSC) of the USGS Western Region will provide additional support to review tsunami hazards for the NRC.  The NRC has received an Early Site Permit (ESP) application near the Salem-Hope Creek, NH nuclear power plant that will need tsunami review.  USGS-PCMSC technical expertise will be directed at reviewing hydrologic safety issues for each site as related to various aspects of tsunami hazards, including determination of probable maximum tsunami, tsunami source characterization, tsunami propagation, wave run-up, drawdown, and inundation.  To augment this project, the USGS will utilize the abilities of a contractor who has sufficient regional and technical expertise in hydrodynamics and near shore processes in the Central and Eastern United States to participate in these safety and environmental reviews of the site applications.
The period of performance is from Aug. 1, 2011 to Feb. 1, 2013 with two (2) options.
The USGS intends to obtain these services through a noncompetitive procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Part 13.  The intended contractor is Texas Engineering Experiment Station, College Station, Texas.  Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 15:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting Small Business contractors for a construction project for Bulkhead Repairs, Block Island Harbor of Refuge, Rhode Island. <br><br>The work of this project consists of repairing an existing steel sheet pile bulkhead and timber wharf at the Block Island HOR (locally known as "Old Harbor"), Rhode Island. The existing T and are both approximately 250 in lengths. The existing steel bulkhead is to be abandoned in place and a new steel sheet pile bulkhead is to be installed behind it. The stone revetment fronting the existing bulkhead will also be repaired, requiring new stone to supplement the material already existing in the revetment. Also, the deck and framing of the existing timber wharf in front of the bulkhead will be removed and replaced. Existing timber piles are in good condition and will be reused. Due to the proximity of adjacent buildings, it is anticipated that much of the work will be performed from floating platform or jack barge. However, land equipment will be required for excavation and movement of materials. It should also be noted that space for staging of equipment and materials on site is extremely limited. Transport of materials and equipment to the island via the Block Island Ferry is limited and therefore the contractor may need to make other arrangements to bring materials and equipment to the project site. <br><br>This solicitation will be available on or about April 21, 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (Go to http://www.fbo.gov and register now under Vendor/Citizens). Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at the https://www.fbo.gov Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list. This procurement is set aside for Small Business firms. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33,500,000. The estimated cost of the contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District. <br><br>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, plans to award a noncompetitive purchase order with Ly Cox Enterprises, Inc., 6805 S. Frontage Road, Billings, Montana for two WR90 Oscillator Series 3 Walk `n Roll Packer/Roller.  The packer/roller will be an attachment for the John Deere 672G motor grader in BLMs, Vale and Prineville Districts.
PACKER/ROLLER TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  1) 90" packing width, 2) Heavy 12" X 6" single beam main frame with high arch gooseneck, 3) Six heavy duty independent walking beams 4) 2" X 12" hardened steel pivot pins, 5) Five inches of bushing, 6) Twelve easy access 7.50 X 15 smooth roller tires, 7) Individual 6,000 lbs. hubs, 8) Six easy to reach grease zerks, 9) Machine weight not to exceed 3,500 lbs.
In order to have a road that performs properly it needs to be graded and most importantly good compaction, the more tires that stay on the road the better the compaction. The walk `n Roll compactor single walking beam design provides for the best compaction. If the single walking beam unit encounters an object on the road during the grading process only two of the tires leave the road surface, but if the double walking beam encounters the same object four of the tires leave the road surface which leaves 50% more road surface un-compacted. The single walking beam has been shown to compact the road surface faster and better than the double walking beam. 
Vendors who possess the capability to provide the named products may submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing ability to provide the equipment to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received by noon, Thursday, July 21, 2011, local time (PST).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  
Submittals should include the solicitation number, qualifications, and contact information.  They may be sent by either mail at or facsimile.  Mailing address is Bureau of land Management, Attn:  OR952, P. O. Box 2965, Portland, OR 97208.  Facsimile number is 503-808-6312. E-mail address is BLM_OR_SO_952_Mail@blm.gov.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought Notice, as defined in FAR 5.205(a), and is intended to obtain information regarding Industry Vendor interest, capabilities, pricing, and other market information for planning purposes.<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) R&amp;D Program Office (J335) is conducting a market survey to determine the interest and capability of Industry Vendors to support the Sustainment Risk Assessment Process (SRAP) for activities as described below.
<p>DLA Weapon System Support Managers (WSSMs) need automated, proactive tools to identify and evaluate, on a weapons system basis, high risk National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and critical supply chain support issues. WSSMs typically react to existing NSN support or supply chain issues identified from various origins: customer complaints, emails, backorder lists, forecasts or critical part lists (e.g. parts lists to support deployed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq) and/or "war room" lists. Better methods are needed to identify and prioritize high risk NSNs that impact the sustainment of weapon systems or to meet wartime operational requirements. Furthermore, the volume of problem parts lists (quantity and length of lists) leads to short-term fixes, while the underlying root cause remains unidentified, ultimately increasing the time and resources invested. Additionally, WSSMs frequently identify identical parts with different NSNs. These duplicate NSNs require standardization to reduce the probability of being included on the various lists. Lastly, current analytical methods only use historical DLA data rather than including operational and maintenance data with predictive technologies to make meaningful distinctions to prioritize the NSNs on the various lists.<br /><br />Please see the attached Sources Sought Notice for more information.</p>

BACKGROUND 
HARDI (High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging) is a cutting edge MRI technology that will allow the BRRC Neuroimaging Core to more accurately trace and quantify white matter pathways and how stroke affects them. The purpose of this project is to make the technology and the expertise in HARDI through the Neuroimaging Core so that they can do more accurate visualization of white matter pathways in the brain.  


OBJECTIVE
The overall objective of this contract is to acquire professional services to assist in the execution of rehabilitation studies of persons affected by stroke and normal controls. The primary job responsibilities will include teaching Neuroimaging Core personnel basic HARDI processing techniques, some processing of images from BRRC projects, and development of strategies for measuring fiber tracts that have been diminished by stroke.  

DEFINITIONS 
HARDI:  High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging.  A magnetic resonance imaging technique that can measure the integrity of white matter and white matter tracts in the nervous system.  It is superior to more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) techniques because it uses different mathematical algorithms to resolve these pathways.

MRI:  Magnetic Resonance Imaging.  A set of techniques that can be used to measure and image brain structure and brain function.

BRRC:  Brain Rehabilitation Research Center.  A VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Center of Excellence.

Neuroimaging Core:  A research core of the BRRC that makes functional and structural neuroimaging techniques available to BRRC investigators.

3.	The ability to teach complex analysis techniques to Neuroimaging Core personnel.
4.	The ability to refine HARDI and related techniques. 
5.	Experience interpreting HARDI and related images. 

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor's representative will assist the VA researcher and other members of the VA research team by:
1.	HARDI processing and white matter fiber tracking will be accomplished for up to 24 image sets.  
2.	Selected members of from the BRRC Neuroimaging Core will learn HARDI processing and white matter fiber techniques. 
3.	A technique will be developed for measuring the size of fiber tracts, and to quantify the fiber connection strength between brain regions affected by stroke.

DATA/DELIVERABLES 

A brief quarterly report will be submitted to the contract coordinator by the last day of each quarter of the contract (every 3 months).  This report will include the following information:
1.	The number of image sets (out of a maximum of 24) HARDI data sets processed and fibers tracked for the quarter.  The number of image sets processed will depend upon the number of image sets delivered to the contractor by the BRRC Neuroimaging Core and will vary from quarter to quarter, but could be as many as 8-10.  
2.	Progress made in teaching selected person from the BRRC Neuroimaging Core in HARDI processing and fiber tracking techniques. 
3.	Progress made in developing a technique for measuring the size of fiber tracts, and to quantify the fiber connection strength between brain regions affected by stroke. 
4.	If the contract needs to be terminated or discontinued prior to the contract end date, a termination report must be completed that includes a summary or results obtained/work done and the reasons for termination.

ATTACHMENT: SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request #F2XHC71174A003.
<p>MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB (Services)<br /><br />FROM: Community College of the Air Force<br />100 S Turner Blvd<br />Maxwell-Gunter AFB AL 36114</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request # F2XHC71174A003<br /><br />1. Description of supplies/services to be acquired:<br />a. The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) requires a continuation of annual maintenance and support for the mission-critical Singularity software system. This system is used by CCAF to scan and archive more than 60,000 paper transcripts annually and is a vital part of daily CCAF mission operation. CCAF requires the following deliverables:<br />CLIN 001: Singularity Site License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 002: Singularity Server Workflow License, Quantity: 61<br />CLIN 003: Singularity Server User License, Quantity: 316<br />CLIN 004: Singularity XML Framework License, Quantity: 5<br />CLIN 005: Singularity SAFEKEEP Server License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 006: Singularity Scan License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 007: Singularity Transcript Module License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 008: Singularity Index Module License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 009: Singularity OCR Client Designer License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 010: Singularity OCR Client Scan License, Quantity: 1<br />CLIN 011: Singularity OCR Verification License, Quantity: 11<br />CLIN 012: On-site Maintenance Service, Quantity: 7 Days<br />CLIN 013: Phone and E-mail Support, Quantity: 1<br />b. Hershey Business Systems Inc (HBSI, now Hyland Software Inc, HSI) was previously awarded a contract to deliver the web-enabled, enterprise-wide transcript processing and access management system known as Singularity. This software system enables CCAF to automate the processing of approximately 60,000 inbound paper transcripts each year, supporting the CCAF mission of providing more than 17,000 students annually with an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in their career field. This software system integrates with the CCAF Student Transcript Administration and Record System (CCAF-STARS) to facilitate graduation consideration. This software must be licensed annually and maintained through software updates, patches and additional capabilities. As developer and sole owner of the software, HSI is the only provider for this license and the software updates, patches, and additional capabilities required to meet CCAF mission needs as well as the security requirements imposed by the Air Force and Department of Defense.</p>
<p>If the annual maintenance contract is not awarded CCAF will be unable to use the system and will be forced to resort to manual processing requiring civilian personnel overtime charges. This will slow down the transcript evaluation process, resulting in fewer students graduating annually. Since a CCAF degree is required for certain assignments and for promotion to higher enlisted ranks, failure to receive a degree due to the inability of CCAF to process legitimately-provided transcripts significantly harms enlisted career prospects.</p>
<p>c. In FY11 CCAF prepared a major project proposal for Air University (AU) consideration to provide the required system capabilities natively within the existing AU-developed STARS system. Successful completion of this project would result in decommission of the Singularity system and elimination of the sole source support contract. After careful consideration of the costs and benefits of the proposed project, AU has directed CCAF to continue with the existing annual license maintenance contract and will consider the project for funding during FY12. CCAF will additionally continue to monitor on-going advancements and design innovations in the commercial computer software industry for future changes.</p>
<p>2. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />This requirement is issued pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as set forth in FAR Part 13.106-1(b), "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization)."<br /><br />3. Required delivery date for supplies or the period of performance for services.<br />The required delivery date for this contract will be 1 July 2011.</p>
<p>4. Total estimated value of this requirement is $83, 180.23.</p>
<p>5. The information provided above is certified as complete and accurate. Any additional questions may be directed to the undersigned at 649-5150.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) is the managing agency for the National Interagency Cache Business System (ICBS). ICBS is the principle software application which supports core business functions for inventory management in supply warehouses used in support of the protection mission of member agencies of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). The inventory of items stored in incident caches is determined by the NWCG National Fire Equipment Technology Committee. The cache system is comprised of thirteen National Interagency Support Caches ("National Caches") and a smaller number of Local Area Support Caches (LASC) hosted by various federal and state wildland agencies.<br />In a project which focused on the reengineering of the legacy ICBS application was completed in 2010. The result of this effort was:<br />Improved and streamlined business processes (e.g. inventory receiving and issuing, inventory returns and refurbishment, cache-to-cache transfers, cycle counting, annual physical inventory, etc.).
<p>Improved inventory management and visibility through the implementation of wireless bar code scanning technology.</p>
<p>Improved reporting capability.</p>
<p>Improved efficiency in delivering supplies to customers.</p>

<p>The minimum and maximum (cumulative) task order amount for the duration of the (first year) contract will be as follows:</p>
<p>$2,500 Minimum<br />$350,000 Maximum</p>
<p>No guaranteed minimum award will be provided for any subsequent optional future year renewals.</p>
<p>Routine Road Maintenance- Gravel and Native Surfaced Roads<br />When the task order calls for routine blading (road grading) of forest roads, equipment operators with no previous national forest road maintenance experience shall view a short (18-minute) video on proper road maintenance techniques prior to beginning work. The operator shall work in a manner that closely follows the techniques shown in the video.</p>
<p>Commercial Materials<br />Commercial provided materials, such as aggregate, imported borrow, or gates, shall be paid for separately under each Task Order.</p>
<p>Contract Time<br />Task Order contract time will vary with the scope of work described in each order.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division requires AN/SSQ-36, 53 and 62 Sonobuoys, which are non-commercial aircraft launched expendable floating devices used to detect acoustic emissions or reflections from potentially hostile submarines and transmit those signals to U.S. Navy airborne antisubmarine warfare forces. This requirement will be procured through a sole source modification to a currently established contract with ERAPSCO who is the only known qualified and responsible source. The original award was solicited under other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source.
<p>This is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source contract modification for AN/SSQ-36, 53 and 62 Sonobuoys to include FMS and GPS configurations to ERAPSCO, Inc. as a one year option period to an existing contract (N00421-11-C-0030). The anticipated award date will occur in March 2012. The modification will be issued in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)). It would take approximately one year to run a competition for the necessary FY13 sonobuoy quantities. The government cannot meet Fleet Inventory Requirements for a full year without uninterrupted sonobuoy deliveries. The government intends to award the current requirement to ERAPSCO as they are the only known qualified and responsible source of the AN/SSQ-36, 53 and 62 sonobuoys who can meet the needs of the government without product delays as they have a production line currently running. The issuance of this modification will allow the Government to meet the needs of the fleet while the command prepares for a full and open competition for fiscal years 14 through 18 sonobuoy quantities.<br /><strong>See Numbered Note 22.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals</em></strong>, however, interested parties may submit a capability statement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 2:00 PM Eastern Time, 20 July 2011.</p>

In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to lisa.r.safewright@census.gov, by 3pm on Wednesday, July 20, 2011. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc., without further notice.

This is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms believing that they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer at fdones-cardona@usgs.gov. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency by July 15, 2011.

<DESC>The Contracting Division, AAC/PKOB at Eglin AFB, Florida, intends to award sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to InfiNetwork dba Net Village, Laurel, MD, for the purchase of WorldGroup Software License Renewal for the 53 CSS, Eglin AFB, FL. The 53 CSS support of the Combat Air Force Network (CAFNet) mission has continually expanded to meet Air Force needs. As our needs have expanded our network requirements, we had to add additional WorldGroup software licenses. Without this software, our servers would not meet network security requirements levied by Joint Air Force Army Navy (JAFAN) 6/3 regulations. WorldGroup has been in use on our network systems for many years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 511210 and the small business size standards $25 million. The proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of publication. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Point of Contact: Audrey Hughes, 850-882-0341, Fax 850-882-1680. Email: audrey.hughes@eglin.af.mil Alt. POC is Elisa J.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for the following commercial items: Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001: Fabrication and installation of a head expander and associated test hardware on the Ling 2000 vibration equipment located at U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground's Carr Facility. The head expander and associated test hardware shall be designed and fabricated in accordance with the scope of work as follows: The contractor shll provide a solution to the static weight and stress forces required to vibrate a 2250 pound bomb on the Ling 2000 Vibration test fixture located at CARR Facility, Dugway Proving Ground (DPG). The vibration equipment specifications in use at DPG are provided as Technical Exhibit (TE) 1. The vibration profile is also provided as TE 2. The specifics that shall be addressed are listed as follows: (a) The Ling 2000 vibration head currently has a head expander that weighs 1350 pounds (This will have to be removed by the Government). The total static weight capability of the system is 3000 pounds. The payload to be tested is 2250 pounds with the Multipurpose Aircraft Unit (MAU) 12 bomb rack as an additional requirement that weighs 96 pounds. The solution will have to provide a new head expander and the weight will be critical. The weight is most critical on the vertical push. (b) Due to the test item having an elongated shape that is equal to the Bomb Live Unit (BLU)/109 with tail section making the total test item approximately 12 feet long with a 14 inch diameter means that the test fixture solution will have to have external stabilizers (flexors) incorporated. (c) The solution will also have to allow the bomb test item on the MAU 12 upside down (Not Suspended) and the vibration head to be situated on the vibration system at Ling test fixture "0" or centered such that no weight will be resting on the Ling system. (d) The head expander used for the vertical push will also have to go onto the horizontal slip table that will be used so that the long axis push can center the bomb on the slip table and allow the bomb to pass over the head. This height will have to be 22 inches above the slip table. The slip table has a total weight capacity of 19,815 pounds. The solution is to raise the bomb and MAU 12 high enough to allow the long push with- out hitting the Ling vibration head. The slip table is 44 inches from the head to the center of the table. The slip table is a TEAM, LPS -14, Model No. 483.360, weight limit is 19,815 pounds. (e) The solution will be modeled to insure performance against resonance frequencies. Any additional requirements to account for this will be included in the final test fixture. All modeling data will be provided to insure completeness of design and for historical data of test concept and solution to allow DPG to validate the final data of the test item. Design as built drawings shall be provided within 60 calendar days after completion. (f) The test fixture must meet the bolt hole pattern for the Ling vibration head. The MAU 12 has to be the interface between the head expander and the test item. (g) Design concept drawing and install specifications shall be provided to DPG at the 90% design review to assess the interface details for preparation of the facility. (h) New system interface controls should interface with existing equipment as far as possible as required. (i) Descriptions of the BLU/109 with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail and MAU 12 bomb rack can be found on the internet. The contractor shall provide service and warranty data as required for this test fixture as well all operational specifications for lubrication or operations.. This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). Submit written offers (oral offers will not be accepted), on RFQ W911S6-11-T-0047.

<p>a. Technical capability of the supplies/services offered to meet the Government's minimum <br />requirement to include the depth of warranty and maintenance.<br />b. Price.</p>
<p>In determining the best value to the Government, technical capability is more important than price, though price remains a significant factor and must be reasonable and affordable.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NICHD2011108 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive  Foster City, CA 94404 a quantity of one (1) ea of the following instrument and components:1.	5500xl-u Sequencer Upgrade from SOLiD 4 to include:
a.	5500xl SOLiD Sequencer and workstation computerb.	5500xl SOLiD Instrument Control Softwarec.	5500xl SOLiD Sequencer Accessoriesd.	5500xl SOLiD install reagents ande.	5500xl Upgrade Training Webinar 
Upgrading the SOLiD sequencer to 5500 XL increases the capacity of the machine from 30 Gigabase-pairs per run to 300 Gigabase-pairs per run.  This increase in capacity allows for greater sample throughput in a shorter time.  Upgrading to the XL also dramatically reduces the overall cost of sequence per base.

 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  
(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

(i)	TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF PROPOSED ITEM
(ii)	DELIVERY SCHEDULE
(iii)	PAST PERFORMANCE
(iv)	PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A will comply statement without accompanying technical specifications and/or drawings of product being offered is automatic failure under this factor.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) and delineated in SOW will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), (iii), and (iv).  In the second step of evaluating the offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), DELIVERY SCHEDULE, and Factor (iii) PAST PERFORMANCE, all combined with factor (i) is approximately of equal importance with Factor (iv), PRICE.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF PROPOSED ITEM.  Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Criteria to use is conformance with ALL requirements delineated in the SOW. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.
 

(c)  DELIVERY SCHEDULE.  Due to un-availability of alternative dining facility on the island, delivery schedule or period of performance (POP) is a critical factor. Offerors must present a plan for POP that minimizes the number of days the galley will be rendered not operational.  The maximum number of days for removal of old and installation of new equipment is seven (7) consecutive days, to include a weekend. This number of days does not include the shipments in and out of equipment, tools, and supplies. Any offers exceeding the seven (7) days schedule for removal and installation shall be disqualified from further consideration. Completion date must be within sixty (60) days from contract award.
  Offers shall be evaluated acceptable or unacceptable.  

(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(End of Clause)

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .
 

Additional instruction to offerors: Offers shall include following:
(1)	Signed priced offer on company letterhead (see FAR 52.212-1) with point of contact information, DUNS, Cage Code, and business size/type.

(3)	Statement addressing how minimum requirements are to be met, if not in technical drawing/specification.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (Best Value), price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />- In order of importance</p>
<p>(1)AVAILABILITY AND QUALIFICATION OF KEY PERSONNEL; Resumes, Certifications <br />(2)SECTION 2, EXHIBIT: EHS CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS SUBMITTALS <br />(3)PAST PERFORMANCE/REFERENCES<br />(4)COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE<br />(5)PLAN OF OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE<br />SUB-FACTOR A: PHASE IN/OUT PLAN<br />SUB-FACTOR B: QUALITY CONTROL PLAN<br />(6)PRICE</p>
<p><br />(c)Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>For this solicitation, technical merit is more important than cost or price. Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost or price and technical merit. As technical merit of the offeror's' proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The Government may conduct a price reasonableness evaluation in order to determine if the overall price<br />proposed is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Note: Award of this contract may be made based on the initial quotation/proposal and without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Offeror's are cautioned to submit their proposal on the most favorable basis, since the Government reserves the right to make an award without further negotiations or discussions.</p>
<p><br />RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and Unacceptable,with the exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral*</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un-acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull;OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.</p>
<p>&bull;GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.</p>
<p>&bull;ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.</p>
<p>&bull;UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths.The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>&bull;NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation. * This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

Only the Contracting Officer has the authority to make adjustments to the contract. The QAP is not capable of revising the terms of performance or adding additional work. Further, they are not capable of providing any comments or quality inspections on any delivery order they have not been formally assigned to. The appointment of a QAP shall be made by the Contracting Officer, in a written letter to be transmitted to the vendor's office. Unless the vendor has received this appointment letter, they are not obligated to provide any Government personnel any of the items for the QAP as referenced in this Performance Work Statement, with the exception of the documentation required by the Contracting Officer. The vendor is obligated to sign and return at least two (2) copies of the QAP Appointment letter within two (2) business workdays of their receipt of the letter from the 48th Contracting Squadron.</p>
<p>1.6.2. Evaluation Criteria. The Government will evaluate the contractor's performance under this contract using this Performance Work Statement's Service Summary as the primary basis of observation. Government QAP will record all surveillance observations. When an observation indicates defective performance, the QAP will require the contract manager or representative at the site, to initial the observation. The initialing of the observation does not necessarily constitute concurrence with the observation, only acknowledgement that he/she has been made aware of the defective performance. Any action taken by the Contracting Officer as a result of surveillance will be according to the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>1.6.3. Quarterly Progress Meetings. The Government shall conduct quarterly quality control progress meetings. The purpose of these meetings shall be to review the status of any detected discrepancies, and outline the Government's requirements for the following months. To provide all parties with cost savings, the contractor shall be able to conduct these meetings via teleconference - at the vendor's written request. The contracting officer reserves the right to increase the frequency of progress meetings, should the situation demand it. Should the vendor provide a written request, these meeting may be held via teleconference, should the Contracting Officer approve it.</p>
<p><br />1.7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1.7.1. Expectations. The contractor shall obtain both base and vehicle passes. Specific instructions will be provided at the pre-award conference.</p>
<p>1.7.2. Department of Defense Instruction 1402.5. As large portions of this requirement include working around, and officiating services for Department of Defense Dependent children, DODI 1402.5 is in effect for this requirement. This instruction obligates all personnel in a supervisor capacity, or working with children under their direction, to undergo a background check prior to being alone with a Department of Defense Dependent Child. Per the direction provided by this instruction; personnel who have not completed an appropriate background check - but are in a constant line of sight with an individual who has passed a background check meeting the terms of DODI 1402.5, may still provide performance on a probationary basis. The Quality Assurance Personnel attached to this contract shall provide escort while the contractor employees commence performance, but it is still expected that the vendor shall commence the procedure for undergoing the investigation for all assigned personnel upon contract award. Vendors should consider this added cost when proposing their prices for this requirement, as it is not the Government's intention to provide an additional equitable adjustment for this concern after award. The Government does not expect the vendor to submit all of their personnel for this background check, but sufficient individuals should be certified to ensure a smooth flow of operations. This determination should be dependent on the number of officials to be provided per line item - and included in the technical plan.</p>
<p>1.7.3. Vetting Procedure for Background Checks. Prospective vendors shall need to be aware and coordinate documentation in a timely manner to allow appropriate background investigations and checks to be conducted on personnel attempting to access RAF installations in the United Kingdom. While a full review shall be conducted at the pre-performance conference at time of contract award, vendors shall need to transmit information regarding employees at the earliest opportunity, to ensure timely processing of base access passes. The following Air Force Instructions: s AFI 31-501 Section 3.2 and USAFE31-208 Sections C, D, and E, may be used as a guide to illustrate the Air Force's policies for base installation access.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Senior Program Advisor will provide ad hoc support and advice on procurement matters to ensure effective implementation of political transition programming overseas. While the work will be primarily Washington-based, it will be focused on supporting OTI field-based program implementation by ensuring that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the procurement-related information and training they need to start up, manage and close out field-based activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified Senior Program Advisor to provide service to OTI's Program Office to ensure effective implementation of political transition and programming areas.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>(1) All Contractor and subcontractor personnel shall, at all times, conspicuously display a distinctive badge provided by the Contractor, identifying such personnel as employees of the Contractor and shall observe and otherwise be subject to such security regulations as are in effect for the particular premises involved.</p>
<p>(2) All Contractor and subcontractor personnel shall be easily recognized by wearing Government provided security badges while working in any of the USSTRATCOM facility, or any other Air Force building on Offutt Air Force Base used by the Contractor's employees.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall provide direct supervision of its own employees but shall not supervise or accept supervision from any Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor shall designate to the Contracting Officer in writing an on-the-premises representative to serve as point of contact for the Contractor with the Contracting Officer or their duly authorized representative.</p>
<p>(5) All Contractor and subcontractor employees shall dress appropriately for a professional work environment.</p>
<p>16. USE OF TOBACCO IN DOD FACILITIES</p>
<p>The Department of Defense has banned smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco in Government facilities. Contractor employees and visitors are subject to the same restrictions as are Government personnel. Smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco are permitted outdoors only in designated areas.</p>
<p>17. WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION:</p>
<p>Whenever the clause 52.228-5, Insurance--Work on a Government Installation, is included in a contract, prime Contractors shall be required to either provide copies of insurance certificates or certify in writing that the required insurance has been obtained before commencing work on the installation. If the Contractor's certification is used in lieu of submission of insurance certificates to the contracting officer, a Certificate of Compliance with Insurance Requirements shall be used for the prime Contractor. After certification by the Contractor, the Certificate of Compliance shall become part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>18. MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE<br />1. Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB. Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle. Offutt AFB Instruction 31-204, 20 October 2010, Security, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision states that failing to utilize seat belts or other restraints while moving will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the individual's traffic history on Offutt AFB being assessed points for the first offense. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on your ability to perform your contract. Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base. Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply. In addition, the following administrative penalties, as a minimum, will be imposed on drivers who are cited for speeding 10 mph - 15 mph over base housing posted speed limits: the first offense will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the individual's traffic history being assessed points. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on your ability to perform your contract. <br />2. Contractor personnel are advised that vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2). Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators are subject to being stopped and ticketed solely for this offense and the individual's traffic history on Offutt AFB being assessed points for the first offense. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on your ability to perform your contract.</p>

System must be mobile and have a means to deploy, recover and secure/store an "inflated" blimp.<br><br>Note: The storage of an inflated blimp is important because it saves a considerable amount of set up time and helium costs due to not having to re-inflate the blimp after each use.  Storage time defined as 24-36 hours.  <br><br>2.  When airborne the blimp is required to be connected via a 4 or 5 point harnessing system that maintains the tethered line and attached instrumentation as close to vertical as possible.  <br><br>3.  The tethered system is required to be interchangeable with the current tethered system being utilized by the cross-functional teams trained on the operation of this equipment with minimal loss of efficiency.

ET 02-20  	AUTORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CUSTOMERS
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings

WBR 1452.211-80	Notice of Intent to Acquire Metric Products and Services -- Bureau of Reclamation
(a) Metric Transition Plan.  The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation.  This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.
(b) The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Trade Act).  
	(1) Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.  
	(2) The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992, as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.  
	(3) The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.
	(4) As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.
(c) Bureau of Reclamation Implementation.  As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its construction projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system.  Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.
(d) Expected Results.  Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace.  Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.

WBR 1452.222-80	NOTICE OF APPLICABILITY--COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES AND REMEDIES -                                 CHILD LABOR--BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
(a) The clause at FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor, Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, does not apply to Bureau of Reclamation acquisitions to the extent that the contractor is supplying end products mined, produced, or manufactured in -
	(1) Canada, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more; and
	(2) Israel, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more.
(b) Nonapplicability thresholds for other countries are the same as listed in the FAR clause.

GPS M.1                  BASIS FOR AWARD
(a) The contract will be awarded to that responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the essential requirements of the solicitation and is the most advantageous price to the Government.
(b)  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all bids and to waive informalities and minor irregularities in bids received.
(c)  In accordance with FAR 9.105-1, the Contracting Officer may request a bidder to provide detailed information relating to his responsibility and, as necessary, to the responsibility of his proposed subcontractors.  The Contracting Officer expressly  reserves the right to reject the bid of any bidder determines to be nonresponsible.
WBR 1452.2225-82	NOTICE OF WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION PROCUREMENT AGREEMENT                                 EVALUATIONS--BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
In accordance with the Agreement on Government Procurement, as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Pub. L. 103-465), and other trade agreements, FAR Subpart 25.4, World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, applies to Bureau of Reclamation acquisitions.  In order to apply trade agreements unique to Reclamation, the contracting officer will (irrespective of any other provision or clause of this solicitation) evaluate acquisitions at or above the dollar thresholds listed in FAR 25.402(b) without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
NOTIFICATION TO ALL CONTRACTORS
Notification to all Contractors
The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security.  Each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.
Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.  To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.  Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information."  Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard. 
Contractors therefore are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:
Except as authorized by their agencies and pursuant to agency procedures, contractors shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto non-classified systems.  This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employees' or contractors' personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems.  This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
Contractors shall not access classified material unless a favorable determination of the person's eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee, the person has signed and approved non-disclosure agreement, the person has a need to know the information, and the person has received contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.
Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your vigilance to these responsibilities.  If you have any questions regarding handling classified documents, or the blocking of access to sites which have inappropriately posted classified materials, please contact your Contracting Officer.  It will be the Contracting Officer's responsibility to contact the appropriate Government personnel regarding these matters.
Adjustment in the Solicitation Response Date/Time: There is no adjustment to the solicitation date/time as a result of this amendment.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span> What is the anticipated course length of each course offering (session)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 1:</span>The Government requires the course to be three (3)&nbsp;days in length.&nbsp; Please see revised PWS.<br /><br /></em><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:</span> How do you want the proposal submitted, electronically, or if paper, what address?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 2:</span>Per paragraph 2 of the synopsis, the proposals shall be submitted electronically via email to Candace.I.Johnson@nga.mil</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3:</span>The instructions state that the electronic proposal cannot exceed 3MB. The solicitation is 8MB and contains several provisions and clauses that the offeror must fill in (e.g., 52.212-3, 52.209-5, 252-212-7000, etc.). The instructions allow for subdividing the proposal into 2 submissions, but if the solicitation must be filled in and sent, more than 2 submissions would be necessary to comply with the 3MB limit. Please clarify how offerors should submit those sections of the RFP that must be filled in by the offerors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 3:</span>Participants are required to register in ORCA prior to award as stated in the Instructions to Offerors section of the synopsis. Once registered on ORCA, the Reps and Certs can be printed by the Government thus not requiring the offeror to submit this information in a PDF format with their proposal. Exceeding the 3MB file size restriction will cause your proposal to be refused by our email system. Late proposal will not be accepted</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4:</span> Since class size can range from the minimum of 12 to the maximum of 20, to ensure that proposals are evaluated on the same basis, please indicate which number of students upon which the price should be based (e.g., up to 20).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 4:</span>This contract will be a firm-fixed price contract based on the price per CLASS. It is up to the offeror to take into account the number of participants as well as the cost of required course material to formulate their best offer. Please note that the government will pay the agreed upon fixed price, without adjustment, as long as the number of participants fall within the stated range.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5:</span>This paragraph requires that each student receive volumes 1-3 of GAO's Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, plus the update (1210 double sided pages). This will add approximately $150 to the per student cost. Would you consider reducing the content requirement?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 5:</span>The course content, as stated in the PWS, is the requirement of the government. At this time, we will be unable to consider a reduction in the required course content.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6:</span>Can the instructor bring the hard-copy materials to the training location on the day of class or is it mandatory that the materials be shipped?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 6:</span>Course materials are required to be shipped in advance due to the security requirements of our facility. The instructor may NOT bring hard-copy materials to the training location on the day of class; this includes both student materials and instructor lesson plans. The course manager must have the materials on hand in plenty of time to make sure that he/she gets them to the right classroom the day before or the morning of the class. As a reminder, no removable media is allowed to be brought into the building. All PowerPoint presentations must be sent to the course/program manager, who will be able to host them on a projection system.<br /><br /><br /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7:</span>Most FAL courses offered today cover material presented in the GAO RedBook, Vol I and II, thru chapter 9. How much and to what degree do you want material contained in Vol III covered in the course, if at all?<br /><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 7:</span>At a minimum, the offeror shall cover the content noted in section 7.0 Course Objectives. Offerors are free to include additional information in the course content to&nbsp;ensure the three (3) days are full of appropriate course material and&nbsp;the&nbsp;required&nbsp;objectives are covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></em><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 8:</span>May a CD version of the RedBooks, with applicable study guides, be substituted in lieu of hard copies of Volumes I thru III? <br /><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 8:</span>No, CD versions of the RedBook are NOT able to be substituted in place of the hard-copy volumes due to security reasons. Offerors proposing CD versions will be found technically unacceptable and thus disqualified from the competition.<br /><br /></em><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 9:</span> Is there an incumbent who has delivered this training in the past?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 9:</span> You may file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for this information.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 10:</span> Is the development cost of the course to meet the requirements expected to be priced in the base year or spread over the base and the 4 option years and considered as price per course?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 10:</span> The government is requesting a commercial off the self course thus minimizing the need for course development. Per section 3.2 of the PWS, the government is requiring at least one case study included in the course at no additional cost. It is up to the offeror to ensure their course meets the minimum requirement of the government and all associated cost included in their proposed price.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 11:</span> Since we are to use an estimate of somewhere between 12-20 students per course, the price associated with production of materials, shipping, and the purchase of the Red Book and the update will vary between proposals, is this cost to be a part of the price per course? To save the Government money, should there be a separate CLIN for cost reimbursable materials and other direct cost?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 11:</span> per section 7, 2-Price of the Instructions for submission of Offers and Other Information, "Vendors are required to provide a unit price for each course that includes all course material as specified in the PWS as well as a total Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) price." At this time, we will be unable to consider a change in the CLIN structure or the course pricing.<br /><br /></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 12:</span> Proposal cannot exceed 30 pages per volume. Section 3.3 of revised requirements states, "contractor shall submit sample course materials with the proposal to this solicitation." Is the sample course materials part of the 30 pages per volume?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 12:</span> The sample course material may be an attachment that is not included in the page requirement for the technical volume.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 13:</span> Attachment 2 Quality Assurance Surveillance plan (QASP) in section 3.2 instructor qualifications, states, "Subject matter expertise in Appropriations Law as defined in the FAR." Can you reference the section of FAR that defines subject matter expertise in Appropriations Law?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 13:</span> This was an oversight on the part of the government, please disregard this reference as it is not defined in the FAR.</em></p>

<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Stronger Preference:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger preference will be given:<br />Frequency Linewidth: The passive linewidth should be &lt;100kHz, with value added for more narrow linewidths. Locking electronics, which can narrow the laser to below 1 kHz using a user supplied reference cavity.</p>
<p>Stronger preference will be given to stable, low maintenance designs with good references and narrowest passive linewidths.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL DOCUMENT 
FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
		    Office of Acquisition and Logistics
		    Technology Acquisition Center
		    260 Industrial Way West
		    Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a one-year, firm-fixed-price delivery order that will be issued under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 70 Contract, for NetCentric software licenses and maintenance services for use by VA 508 Compliance Office to VA in meeting the Section 508 standards.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to procure NetCentric software licenses including maintenance services.  Section 508 standards are technical standards that are federally mandated that all software must pass which ensure that associated documents are accessible on the internet and intranet.  Specifically, the NetCentric software licenses that will be procured under this proposed action include the CommonLook software, Portable Document Format (PDF) Accessibility Wizard (PAW) software, and Enterprise Content Management Framework (ECMF) software.  The ECMF software will scan the internet/intranet for non-compliant Portable Document Format (PDF) documents and will report non-compliant documents to 508 Compliance Office staff.  This metric will allow the 508 Compliance Office to monitor progress, training, and add additional software licenses to use the CommonLook and PAW software.  The PAW software is an add-in/plug-in to Microsoft (MS) Word using a Wizard format.  The PAW software converts complex data tables in Tag PDF data tables automatically and also provides automatic tagging to documents that have a complex format so they read correctly to the end user.  The CommonLook software is a plug-in to Adobe Acrobat that allows the user to address multiple accessibility compliance issues including automatic tagging of images, remediation of complex data tables, and allows the content author to describe complex graphs in narrative form.  This CommonLook software extends the accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat to meet all 508 standards.  Maintenance services are also required to ensure all the aforementioned software remains operational. The total estimated price of the proposed action is  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this limited source award is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(b), Items peculiar to one manufacturer. 

5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Based on extensive market research, as described in Paragraph 8 below, it was determined that limited competition is viable for this brand name item and service. The NetCentric brand name software has been utilized by VA previously and has consistently met all of VA's requirements.  NetCentric brand name computer software will be used by VA staff on VA computers using other VA standard software applications.  Any software must be compatible with both Adobe Acrobat and with MS Word and operate both applications seamlessly.  Based on market research conducted on the internet and individual analysis of other products with comparison to other software, NetCentric is the only brand name software that can integrate with both Adobe Acrobat and MS Word to produce fully compliant PDF documents. Based on the above information, NetCentric brand name software is the only software that can satisfy all of the aforementioned Section 508 standards and meet all of VA's requirements.  VA also requires maintenance services to ensure all the aforementioned software remains operational.  Only a source with access to NetCentric's proprietary data can provide these services. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) and the Request for Quote will be submitted to contract holders on GSA Schedule 70 in order to fully notify all interested parties and obtain price competition.  Any proposals received will be evaluated.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3 the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. In addition, this J&A will be made publicly available on FBO.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.

8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research in January 2011 by contacting and interviewing other experts in the federal 508 standard compliance product market and testing other brand name software.  After extensive software research, the Government's technical experts determined that only NetCentric brand name software can meet all of VA's needs.  Specifically, the testing efforts showed that other brand name software could not meet the Section 508 standards and could not integrate with both Adobe Acrobat and MS Word to produce fully compliant PDF documents.  Based on the above market research, the Government's technical experts have determined that only NetCentric brand name software can meet all of the Government's requirements.  Market research was conducted in May 2011 utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) Manufacturer Lookup tool and the GSA Advantage Product tool.  VA was able to identify only one reseller of NetCentric software on the NASA SEWP GWAC.  There were two GSA Schedule 70 contract holders identified who are capable for providing the software, one of which is the brand name provider.  Due to the increased possibility for limited competition, it is in the best interest of the Government to release the solicitation on GSA Schedule 70.   

9.  Other Facts: The Government's technical experts performed internet research to identify other tools that might meet VA's needs.  An internet search using the term "PDF 508 verification tool" returned a large number of hits, but none offered actual software other than NetCentric.  




 
10. Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

            508 Compliance Manager		Signature: ______________________
					  
11. Determination of Best Value: I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable. Contracts awarded on GSA Schedule 70 have already been determined to be fair and reasonable.  In addition, the successful quote will be compared to the Independent Government Cost Estimate.

Approval

As the Contracting Activity Competition Advocate and based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve a one-year, firm-fixed-price delivery order that will be issued under the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule 70 Contract, for NetCentric software licenses and maintenance services, pursuant to the authority of FAR 8.405-6(b), subject to availability of funds, and provided that the property and services herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.
