<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER for The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services to Allen Daniels, EdD.

The leaders of MHCA have determined that they would like to develop a quality improvement collaborative and foster it within the membership.  The goals of the collaborative will be to utilize the existing MHCA benchmarking data base and process to support the work of quality improvement within the IOM aims.   Enhancing person-centeredness (using the IOM?s Patient-Centered Aim) was identified as a priority; it is perhaps the most essential/critical aim for mental health and substance abuse system transformation.  An eighteen month process open to those organizations able to make a commitment to participate was proposed.  Additional objectives for the collaborative will include establishing a consensus definition of transformation as well as an examination of how the IOM aims and reports can support and promote desired change.  The benchmarking process and the quality collaborative will be used as tools to promote, measure, and assess this change.  A final goal of the initiative will be to evaluate how this process can be developed into a generalized and transferable model for mental health/substance abuse systems change that can be applied in other settings across other service systems.

The quality improvement collaborative will involve a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 30 organizations.  The group will convene for six quarterly face-to-face meetings in conjunction with regular general MHCA meetings.  A proposed internal organization scheme for the work involves creating 5 sub-groups within the collaborative--each of which will be focused on enhancing person-centeredness through a focus on and exploring the inter-relatedness of one of the other aims (see below).  

Funding for the project will be derived from three sources.  MHCA will provide the meeting support and resources to support the ongoing collaborative.  Collaborative member agencies will support their own participation (e.g. travel costs and other related expenses) as well as cost associate with local quality initiatives.  SAMHSA/CMHS will be called upon to support the facilitation, training and technical assistance, some meeting logistics, leadership, and implementation of this project.

MHCA/IOM Quality Collaborative will focus on the six aims that were developed by the IOM in the initial Quality Chasm report.  These were determined in the report on mental and substance use conditions to be directly applicable and supportive of improved health care quality in both the general health as well as the specialty M/SU sectors.  It should be noted, however, that there is a considerable degree of relatedness and interdependence between the 6 aims.  Of particular importance for behavioral health is the aim of ?patient?-centered care.  Alternatively described as consumer-, person-, or client-centered care, the IOM casts patient centered-care as the essence of transforming the current system into one which is more oriented to recovery and health care quality. The patient-centered aim will be a shared focus for all of the collaborative?s individual projects.  However, in addition each participating organization will be asked to choose another one of the 5 remaining aims to explore how, for example, a focus on timeliness can enhance person-centeredness.  Across the collaborative there will be projects exploring the relationship between, patient-centered and safe, effective, timely, equitable, and efficient care.  Representatives of the MHCA leadership will assist in the coordination and facilitation of the collaborative?s sub-groups by assuming a team leader role for each aim.

Any interested parties who believe they possess the required capabilities to fulfill this requirement should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor?s name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor?s Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small business concerns (including small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, etc.) are encouraged to review this notice.  E-mail capability statement to bjmiller@psc.gov, referencing the Pre-solicitation Number 07M000137 in the subject.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any requests for solicitation packages will be disregarded.

<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure, on a sole-source basis, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 235(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), requires a contractor to upgrade and re-code the Atlantis Ecosystem model for the west coast of the United States.  The Atlantis integrated ecosystem models will evaluate impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems, identify key processes that govern ecosystem condition and the provision of ecosystem services, evaluate the effects of management actions on ecosystem status and services, and identify tradeoffs between species, stakeholders and management goals.

The only known source to perform the required work is CSIRO.  CSIRO is uniquely qualified to perform this work because the Atlantis Ecosystem model was envisioned and the computer code was written by Dr. Fulton with CSIRO.  The model contains in excess of 500,000 lines of computer code.  Although there are three people in the world who can operate the model, Dr. Fulton is the only person who knows and fully understands the details of the model and the computer code underlying the model.  Since the goal of this project is to improve the computer code, there is no other person who could perform the required work.  Dr. Fulton has extensive experience in programming in C++ coupled with extensive experience in ecosystem and other biological / oceanographic models.  She also has the necessary experience in manipulating large data sets for applications of marine ecosystem or similar studies.

All interested concerns demonstrating that have the capability to perform the required services may be provided a solicitation.  Responses to the RFP must be submitted by August 25, 2007.

All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/.  In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.  The applicable NAICS is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5 M.

All interested concerns must submit documentation by email at Sharon.S.Kent@noaa.gov by August 25, 2007.

<CONTACT>Sylvia Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-272-6568, Fax 571-273-0284, Email sylvia.vandyke@uspto.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a continuing requirement, System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services, for independent, objective, and expert technical advice and assistance for ongoing and future information technology initiatives.  This is a re-competition of Contract Nos. 50PAPT201006, with General Dynamics, and 50PAPT201026, with Project Performance Corporation (PPC).  The estimated release date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected on or about August 10, 2007.  The proposal will be due 30 days after release of the RFP.  This requirement is to provide:  System Design, Infrastructure Engineering, Network Engineering, Security Engineering, Certification and Accreditation, System Engineering, Accessibility Engineering, Enterprise Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture, System Development Life Cycle Support, design of infrastructure system components, and may also serve as an unbiased third party in the review of other Government contractors' plans, performance, and products.

Examples of technical efforts include, but are not limited to, the design and implementation of: distributed computer systems; office automation capabilities linked together through a USPTO-wide and wide area or remote (Telework) communications network; capabilities for full deployment of the automated patent text and image search, storage, and retrieval systems; capabilities providing automated support of administrative and management functions; automation of patent application receipt, assignment, and tracking functions, including the electronic receipt of all patent applications; optical character recognition capabilities; and patent and trademark application receipt and processing.  The contractor shall provide design and implementation of changes to the infrastructure, as well as, research, technical and systems engineering advice, support in the development of advanced capabilities for information dissemination and exchange, and support of information technology security.  The contractor shall support software process and tools improvement, and software development methodology improvement.

The USPTO reserves the right to make multiple performance-based service contract awards as a result of this competition.  The NAICS code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services.  The base period of performance is anticipated for 13 months (estimated) with four (4) one-year options periods.  It is anticipated that the contract will be Cost-Plus-Award Fee with task ordering provisions.  The anticipated annual level of effort for this requirement is 203,360 hours for the base period of performance and 200,000 hours for each of the four (4) one-year option periods.  Businesses will be required to respond to the Government's advance 30 minute requirement for meetings at the USPTO in Alexandria, VA. The contractor must use a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that is compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard 748. If the Contractor does not have an existing validated EVMS, or has an EVMS that is not compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EAI-748, the Contractor will be required to submit a plan with their proposal on how they will achieve an ANSI-748 compliant EVMS. The Contractor shall use this non-compliant or non-validated system for an interim period, which will be negotiable between the Government and the Contractor.  At the end of the agreed upon interim period, the Contractor shall be prepared to demonstrate to the Contracting Officer (CO) that the EVMS complies with the ANSI/EIA Standard 748.  Earned Value Management (EVM) shall be applicable to discrete task orders that exceed $200,000 and exceed 90 days to complete.
  
The USPTO would like to emphasize that the winning offerors of the SETA requirement will have a role as a close confidential advisor to the USPTO.  The SETA contractor will assist the USPTO in evaluating the proposals, performance, and products of other contractors, thereby giving them access to proprietary information about potential competitors.  The SETA contractor will also have access to proprietary, source-selection sensitive, or otherwise restricted information.  Because of the close confidential relationship required of the SETA contract, the USPTO is concerned that this will cause other private sector firms to be reluctant in pursuing future work with the USPTO, and that the release of proprietary information to the SETA contractor would have an adverse impact on competition in future procurements with the USPTO.  In order to mitigate these concerns, the USPTO intends to impose strong Conflict of Interest (COI) restrictions on the SETA contractor. These COI restrictions include the prohibition of the winning offeror, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors from participating (in any capacity) in any USPTO procurements, other than those activities in direct support of the SETA contract, throughout the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years.  The SETA contractor, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors will be prohibited from using any proprietary information obtained in support of the SETA contract for the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years or until the information becomes part of the public domain, whichever comes latest. The SETA contractor will be required to certify annually that it, its parent, any affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultant, and subcontractors are in compliance with the USPTO COI requirements.  An electronic copy of the solicitation, when released, will be available at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.  This acquisition will be conducted using streamlined measures to include the use of oral proposals. Details will be contained in the solicitation.  The POC is Sylvia Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, ph: 571-272-6568, fax:  571-273-6568, or e-mail SETA4@uspto.gov., U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement, MDE 7B03, P.O.

<DESC>A competitive acquisition is anticipated to be held for Mode S Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance Testing Capability in the areas of design, implementation, installation, test and evaluation. This will include ongoing technical support from the contractor during the five-year duration of the proposed contract.  The identified Mode S is a stand-alone system. Further detail is provided in the Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) which have been uploaded as part of this Mode S Test and Evaluation Center (MSTEC) notice. This MSTEC posting is similar to a posting made this date under the ACTFAST identifier; however, the latter identifier is not appropriate for the acquisition of this 
stand-alone Mode S system. This FedBizOpps posting stands up the MSTEC acquisition. The next posting under MSTEC will be the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in Aug 2007. Offerors will have thirty (30) calendar days to provide complete proposals.  It is anticipated it will be a best value source selection.  Further, that all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.  However, price will contribute substantially to the award decision.  The Government anticipates a ceiling price of no more than $5M under the Mode S acquisition with award of contract in Nov 2007.  The draft SOW and CDRLs that are specific to the Mode S requirements are part of this posting.  Industry is encouraged to provide comments on the attached draft SOW and CDRLs.  Responses to the SOW and CDRLs will be addressed to joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil and are due no later than 4:00 PM (local time) on 06 Aug 2007.  Firms can respond under either this MSTEC posting or the ACTFAST posting (both postings made this date); however, note should be made that all future Mode S postings will be made only under MSTEC and Solicitation No. FA9302-07-R-0005.

In implementing its mission, DRO is responsible for carrying out all orders for the required departure of aliens handed down in removal proceedings, or prior there to, and arranging for detention of aliens when such becomes necessary. DRO maintains and operates the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS) to process cases located by the Border Patrol, Investigations and Inspections activities. The D&R activities are directly reliant upon these other activities. Investigative and Border activities locate aliens who are denied entry or further stay in the United States and whose departure must be enforced.

The Contractor is required, in units housing ICE detainees, to perform in accordance with the most current editions of the ICE Detention Standards, American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (ALDF), and Standards Supplement, Standards for Health Services in Jails, latest edition, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC).     Some ACA standards are augmented by ICE policy and/or procedure.     In cases where other standards conflict with DHS/ICE Policy or Standards, DHS/ICE Policy and Standards prevail.     ICE Inspectors will conduct periodic inspections of the facility to assure compliance of the aforementioned standards.
       
The Contractor shall furnish detention (armed/unarmed) officer services, including management personnel, supervision, manpower, relief officer, uniforms, equipment, and supplies to provide guard services seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours per day for the El Paso Service Processing Center.     The Contractor is responsible for record keeping services.
       
The El Paso Service Processing Center generally operates at an operational capacity of 700-1000 detainees.     The Contractor shall provide a minimum of one Detention Officer of the same gender as the detainees on each post. Detainees are classified as High (Level 3), Medium (Level 2), or Low Risk (Level 1). It is imperative that assigned posts are properly covered at all times.
       
The Contractor shall provide its own fully operational and well-maintained equipment, supplies and forms that pertain to its own business enterprise. Business activities may include replacing equipment and manpower to ensure full service at the ICE location. The Contractor shall provide the transportation for detainees as described in the forthcoming solicitation.     In addition, the Contractor shall provide full and complete cooperation for any request or investigation conducted by the Government.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the procurement of sewage collection systems. 

NAMSA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NAMSA intends to use the sealed bidding method. Partial bidding is not authorized.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFIB is IFIB PBL 70010 - Annex C and Annex D. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFIB-PBL-70010.

The type of information to be passed on to the firms to enable them to bid is expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The contractor shall furnish to NAMSA sewage collection systems, each consisting of insulated sewage pipe, a heat trace cable system, and a sewage vacuum evacuation system in accordance with the requirements in the forthcoming Statement of Work (SOW). The heated pipe and evacuation system is intended to provide a reusable sewage collection system that can be laid on the surface of suitable terrain to assist in establishing rapidly deployable headquarters camps for NATO military forces over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions. Four separate sewage collection systems, including both heated collection pipe and evacuation components, are required, one system for each of 4 modular camps.

These systems will be

- stored in outdoor storage facilities until needed

- configured and loaded quickly for a specific mission

- transported by sea, land or air along with standard ISO 6.058 meter sea containers

- erected and connected rapidly by skilled soldiers who may be unfamiliar with the task

- combined with other facilities to constitute a pre-planned camp

- deployed on exercises for short periods each year or deployed on military operations as required

- operated intensively with minimum maintenance under harsh field conditions during military operations for periods lasting up to two years

- dismantled, repacked, stored and re-used a minimum of five operational cycles with only minimum refurbishment

- used to evacuate sewage in a manner that meets the highest standards of hygiene and environmental protection

Domestic sewage, both black and gray water, will drain by gravity from up to 27 producing facilities that are provided by others in each of the 4 modular camps. The contractor will provide equipment to collect this sewage and transport it to a sewage treatment facility that will also be provided by others in each camp. It is expected that the average daily load will be 50,000 liters per day with maximum operating loads of 70,000 liters likely for extended periods of time. There will be 2 peak periods for daily flow, 0600-0800 hours and 1600-1800 daily, with each peak period expected to produce 35% of the daily load.

The sewage will be colleted in interface (holding) tanks adjacent to each of the approximately 27 producing facilities in each camp and evacuated through a vacuum system of surface-laid, insulated HDPE pipe fitted with channels and heat trace cables. The pipe lengths will be nominally 6 meters long and will be connected to transport sewage over gently undulating terrain a distance varying between 500 and 700 meters. The piping system, including joints, will be required to perform trouble-free during the extreme temperature swings in a range of harsh climatic conditions. The sewage will be discharged into a wet well at a sewage treatment plant provided by others.

NAMSA may wish to procure additional units of equipment beyond those confirmed as requirements in the forthcoming IFIB and relevant SOW. These additional systems will be required to be priced separately as optional quantities. NAMSA must exercise the option to purchase the additional quantities within 2 years of the contract award. This additional equipment may include up to a 50% increase beyond the equipment listed.

For a copy of Draft Sewage Collection Estimated Quantities, send an email request to lcarpent@bis.doc.gov

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFIB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility: 17 August 2007.

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the IFIB to those on the Bidders List: not before 23 August 2007. 

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD. The bids to be received in response to this NAMSA IFIB will be valid for a period of 180 days.

4. Anticipated date of award: TBD. Contract completion is estimated to be required not later than 180 calendar days after contract award.

- operated intensively with minimum maintenance under harsh field conditions during military operations for periods lasting up to two years

- dismantled, repacked, stored and re-used a minimum of five operational cycles with only minimum refurbishment

- employed to provide reliable, safe sewage treatment that will allow effluent and sludge discharge to the surroundings without consequence for the local environment, citizens or the camp occupants

The sewage will be collected by others from tented living accommodation modules, each of which will accommodate 500 persons dispersed throughout the module. There will be 4 such accommodation modules, each with a separate sewage system. The collection system, supplied by others, will collect combined grey and black water from a kitchen, from shower and toilet facilities, from a laundry, and from an incinerator scrubbing system, each of which was built to accommodate 500 users. Some of the collection systems may also gather sewage from either a small medical clinic or a jail.

The raw sewage will enter the treatment facility through a mechanical screen provided by the contractor. All equipment upstream of the screen will be the responsibility of others. This mechanical screen must be capable of removing hair, string, condoms, plastic bags and other solids that do not readily break down during normal biological treatment. The screened sewage will be transferred by pump or gravity to the bioreactor for aeration and oxidization through an equalization tank, if necessary. With or without an equalization tank, the system must be capable of dealing with peak loadings even during periods of maximum flow, without interfering with the normal bio-reaction process. Either continuously or in batches, the treated liquid will be separated into treated permeate and sludge. The permeate, following UV treatment and/or chlorination, must be of sufficient quality that it can be safely discharged periodically for agricultural use or for dewatering and incineration, with the dewatering and incineration to be done by others.

NAMSA may wish to procure up to 3 additional units of equipment beyond the four treatment facilities confirmed as requirements in the forthcoming IFIB and relevant SOW. These additional systems will be required to be priced separately as optional quantities. NAMSA must exercise the option to purchase the additional quantities within 2 years of the contract award. 

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFIB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility: 17 August 2007.

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the IFIB to those on the Bidders List: not before 23 August 2007. Bidders will be allowed not less than 84 days to reply to the relevant IFIB.

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD. The bids to be received in response to the NAMSA IFIB will be valid for a period of 180 days.

4. Anticipated date of award: TBD.

<ARCHDATE>01262008
<CONTACT>Debra Zamarron (760) 939-9658 John D. Watkins, (760) 939-8158
<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) are sought to develop and test critical technologies for a low cost, obscured weather capable weapon seeker to attack moving targets. Future Navy guided weapons require increased capability to attack moving and stationary targets in all weather conditions. Adding the new asymmetric targets from the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) require flexible and low cost weapon solutions to attack these highly mobile threats. The Navy seeks low cost, innovative, and new invention technologies that will significantly improve the capabilities of existing weapon systems. The Direct Attack Seeker Head (DASH) is a demonstration of multiple low cost technologies integrated to provide enhanced capabilities. The DASH seeker shall support fire and forget operation. The use of new, low cost, high performance components now hitting the electronics market will be critical to obtain the DASH cost objective. The DASH goal will be a modular           seeker design allowing for a single production line item that can then be integrated into multiple weapon systems using adapter kits. Weapon systems that could benefit from DASH performa!  nce and cost benefits vary from Zuni, to JDAM, JSOW, JAGM, JASSM, HARM, SDB II, Harpoon, and Tomahawk. For the DASH demonstration, a 5" inch form factor based on the DSU-33 fuze will be used. This form factor would be compatible with the majority of the possible weapon integrations. The target set for DASH will be stationary and moving targets in land and maritime environments. along with environmental, launch platform, weapon integration, and operational information. Cost will be a major driver in the DASH design and tradeoffs of Cost vs. requirements will be conducted as required. This BAA includes the first area of interest for the DASH seeker, which is titled  "0/0 Sensor" (The remaining areas of interest for DASH will be solicited in a future BAA action which includes the imaging           sensor (if needed), Automatic Target Recognition, Target Trackers, Core Processor, Sensor Fusion, and Divert Algorithms). The 0/0 Sensor must be able to correctly identify targets via Automatic Targeting algorithms or be physically compatible with an imaging sensor.  Due to budget limitations, the contractor should not pursue development of either an imaging sensor or Automatic Target Algorithms.  The proposal topic area of specific interest in this BAA action is a Zero Ceiling, Zero Visibility, practically all weather sensor.  The objectives of this topic is to provide a sensor capable of detecting and tracking moving and stationary targets in obscured weather conditions at tactically significant ranges or subcomponent technologies applicable to such a sensor design. The sensor design must utilize innovative low cost components and production methods to achieve an estimated unit production cost of less than $10K in a 30,000 quantity production. Included in the sensor will be target detection and tracker algorithms. The detection/tracker algorithm will have a high probability of acquiring the target designated by the launch platform or designated by In-Flight Target Updates (IFTUs) from data link equipped weapons within two seconds to impact. The program goals/specifications are enclosed in Section 1.4 of the enclosed attachment.  A Pre-Proposal Industry Day will occur on 15 August 2007. The location will be at NAWCWD in China Lake, CA. The purpose of the Industry Day is twofold: 1. To further disseminate the government team's interests in regard to this program. 2. To provide a forum for potential partnering arrangements for interested parties. It is anticipated that the day will start with a government team presentation to all parties followed by a public question and answer session. If you plan on attending the meeting, you will need to follow the requirements found in Section 8 of the enclosed attachment.  A listing of the questions and answers discussed  by the government team during the public sessions of the Industry Day meeting will be posted as an amendment to this BAA synopsis. Please notify the Science & Technology POC listed in Section 1.5 of intent to attend so that proper security arrangements may be arranged.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation, will not be issued. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of Texas at Austin  
to develop an improved version of the Simple Inner Magnetosphere Model (SIMM). SIMM produces a correlation map of particle fluxes within the inner magnetosphere. These maps can be generated from the bounced-averaged particle drift equations calculated by SIMM.  In order to generate reliable data-driven maps of the inner magnetospheric particle fluxes, it is important to determine the correlations between fluxes at different locations within the inner magnetosphere.  The University will provide:
1.	Code Parallelization and Modernization
a.	Modernize SIMM to Fortran 90 
b.	Convert SIMM to run in parallel using to MPI
2.	On-site Support
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE 100K).  This notice is issued for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  The University of Texas is the only source that can provide multiple developers with the required expertise to perform the necessary development in this project.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to NOAA's program may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Earth Data Network for Education and Scientific Exchange (EDNES) to create and implement a proto-type deployable web-application that will support the generation of space environmental impacts on military and civilian systems.  The aim of the project is to unite international data systems and archives into a common framework, EDNES is part of and related to the World Data Center system which is an integral part of the international component of the web-application.  It will access space environment data stored locally or across a network and generate an effects matrix based on the input data.   This software will also be able to directly interface with simulations, federations, or space-replication systems automatically (machine to machine).
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE 100K).  This notice is issued for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Because this work requires extension of and familiarity with three distinct software systems, the EDNES team is the only supplier that can provide multiple developers with expertise in all three systems.  No competitive solicitation is planned. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to NOAA?s  program may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>NASA/GRC intends to purchase dedicated high-speed one gigabit network connectivity service from The Ohio State University's Ohio Supercomputer Center Network (OSCnet).  NASA/GRC requires a high-speed, high capacity internet connection to Ohio's colleges and universities, K-12 schools, state and local governments, medical research centers and Wright Patterson Air Force Base. This is required to enable NASA/GRC to conduct collaborative efforts in developing new and innovative technology and leveraging its computational, analytical, and experimental expertise to promote development and transfer of critical technologies that address national priorities through research, technology development, and systems development for reliable exploration, aerospace, and space applications.  Only OSCnet can offer the required service to NASA/GRC a fair and reasonable price to NASA/GRC.  NASA/GRC currently has access/use rights to an already installed one (1) gigabit circuit via its partnership with the Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI).	However, it can be only be accessed/utilized by OSCnet membership. NASA/GRC intends on purchasing a yearly membership with OSCnet in order to meet this requirement.  Purchasing the service from any vendor other than OSCnet would be cost prohibitive to the Government.  NASA/GRC would have to incur the cost for installing the necessary infrastructure for a new circuit.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The NASA Facilities Engineering and Real Property Division proposes to enter into a  contract with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), for software tools and services that are necessary to maintain specifications and facilities documents jointly in a secure environment with other participating Federal agencies.  These tools and services are only available through NIBS.  NIBS is an authoritative non-profit resource on matters of building regulations, science and technology in the United States having expertise in the technology.  NIBS was established to provide for free and open discussion of technical issues and problems affecting building design, construction and management where there was once conflict and misunderstanding between government and the private sector building industries.  The Institute brings together representatives of Federal, state and local government agencies, and representatives of the private sector and consumer interest for open, working sessions that seek consensus solutions to building problems of mutual concern.  NIBS also has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Army for the purpose of establishing a license agreement to make accessible to private industry, Federal, state and local governments the Project Extranet (ProjNET) software suite developed by	the U.S. Army.	 NASA has a requirement for software tools and services that are necessary to maintain specifications and facilities documents jointly in a secure environment with other participating Federal agencies.  These tools and services are only available through NIBS.	The tools include the Project Extranet (ProjNET) software suite; other inter-related products and services; and membership in NIBS.  ProjNet is a suite of tools used to support various facility design and construction activities.  These tools include the Design Review and Checking System (DRCHECKS), the Criteria Management System, the Criteria Change Request System, and the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE).  Other inter-related products and services include developing and maintaining the Whole Building Design Guide; facilitation of the buildingSMART Alliance, and performing specialized studies in which NASA requires the unbiased expertise of NIBS Councils and Committees.  These products and services are presently acquired from NIBS via individual interagency funds transfers to the US Army Corps of Engineers and the General Services Administration or through purchase orders.  A change in the Army's administrative procedures for managing ProjNET now requires NASA (and all other agencies) which use ProjNET to use NIBS as the means of access.   The statutory authority for procuring this requirement by other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Citation:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) was authorized by the U.S. Congress in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  The Government anticipates awarding a five year, cost-no fee, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on August 10, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with the University of Puerto Rico of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico to upgrade the existing Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) to provide local and regional tsunami warning capabilities. The Government intents to acquire technical services to upgrade and maintain: 1) tsunami monitoring infrastructure consisting of seismic and sea-level instrumentation and 2) the PRSN Communications and Operational Infrastructure in support of NOAA's Tsunami Program (TSU). The existing PRSN is located at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and consists of five broadband seismic stations, seismic communications (not real-time), 1 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS), and 6 TsunamiReady tide gauges.  UPR also provides system administration and other system related support services under the contract. The PRSN currently utilized by TSU supports NOAA's strategic goals in Weather and Water by enabling its ability to issue timely and accurate tsunami forecast and warning products and to maintain reliable and coordinated data, communications, and dissemination infrastructure in support of TSU. Under TSU, UPR/PRSN will be responsible for the upgrade of: 1) the communications infrastructure at the Anegada Seismic Station to provide continuous real-time, two-way communication system for the transmission of broadband and strong motion seismic and GPS data; 2) 1 of the existing 5 broadband stations in the PRSN to provide on-site recording and timing capabilities to the stations as well as an upgraded communications systems.  UPR will also install back-up sea-level tide gauges in Puerto Rico for the existing PRSN sea-level network. UPR will also improve communications and operational infrastructure to enhance interoperability between the PRSN and the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning Centers. To support the PRSN increased computational requirements to process tsunami related data, the existing PRSN must be augmented to provide additional support staff services through the end of this contract (September 2008). The aforementioned equipment, upgrades and additional resources must be integrated into the existing PRSN. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrations an ability to furnish a system enhancement capable of meeting the previously cited requirements. Interoperability of the PRSN with the NWS Tsunami Warning Centers is required. Of particular concerns to the Government is accomplishment of the system enhancement without any interruption or degradation of performance both during the actual system as well as during the remainder of the system's life (through, September 2008). Vendors must include in its response, an explanation, in explicit detail, of its plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing PRSN. All detailed technical information and technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses is solely within its discretion. Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis. NOTE 22.

Contractor to provide High resolution LiDAR data for project areas within Mount Rainier and North Cascades National Parks according the scope of work.  Project Overview and Description High resolution LiDAR data is being sought for project areas within Mount Rainier and North Cascades National Parks.  Data will be collected using a multiple return LiDAR laser system to capture the variability of the vegetation as well as penetrate the vegetation canopy to create a detailed ground model with the highest possible resolution and accuracy.  Data will serve a variety of project needs but is primarily needed to aid park planners in developing flood recovery and protection plans and assist geology research and landform mapping.  Data provided will be public domain. Project Areas Project areas are located within Mount Rainier National Park and North Cascades National Park in Washington State.  The project is divided into three areas.  Project areas include areas of extreme topographic relief, dense forest, and/or high elevation.  Maximum elevation for the Mount Rainier summit is 14,410 feet. Area 1: Mount Rainier High Priority Drainages 40,055 acres Area 2: Mount Rainier Upper Mountain and Forest Zone - 197,576 acres Area 3: North Cascades Goodell and Newhalem Watersheds - 43,940 acres Available is area map and shapefiles of the project areas in compressed zip file. Specifications The specifications differ by project area.  The extreme relief in Area 2 requires a higher flight altitude and reduced point density.  The cumulative point density of Area 2 should be planned at 4 Points/m2, but the minimum specification is 3 Points/m2 to meet contract guarantees for the rugged terrain on the summit of Mount Rainier. Guarantees: o No less than 35% no-overlap area for the project as a whole. o No arbitrary 1 km x 1 km square with < 40% no-overlap area. o Within areas of swath overlap, no 30m x 30m area with less than 40% design pulse density. o ? 85% design pulse density (all returns) for entire project area. Areas 1 and 3: Minimum Cumulative Point Density:	6 Points/m2 Scan Angle:	±15o from nadir Ground Swath Width:	<535 meters Laser Pulse Rate:	? 71kHz Flight Altitude:	1000 m AGL Overlap:	50% side-lap (100% overlap) Flight Line Direction:	Opposing Returns per Pulse:	Up to four Accuracy (1 ?) Slopes < 20o Vertical:	<13 cm Accuracy (1 ?) Slopes < 20o Horizontal:	<22 cm Areas 2: Minimum Cumulative Point Density:	3 Points/m2 Scan Angle:	±15o from nadir Ground Swath Width:	<964 meters Laser Pulse Rate:	? 50kHz Flight Altitude:	1800 m AGL Accuracy (1 ?)Overlap:	50% side-lap (100% overlap) Flight Line Direction:	Opposing Returns per Pulse:	Up to four Accuracy (1 ?) Slopes < 20o Vertical:	<15 cm Accuracy (1 ?) Slopes < 20o Horizontal:	<60 cm Quality Control The LiDAR system is to be calibrated before the mission, using quality control (QC) pre-mission flights based on manufacturer's specifications. The positional accuracies of the LiDAR (x, y, z) returns are to be checked against these known locations to verify the calibration and to report base accuracy. GPS ground control will be used to maximize satellite visibility and minimize distance between ground monuments and the aircraft. Before each flight, the position dilution of precision (PDOP), along with the expected satellite constellation, will be determined for each mission day. During any data collection flight, the PDOP value will not exceed 3.5 and will use a satellite constellation of ?6. During acquisition, a minimum of two dual frequency DGPS base stations, recording at 1-second epochs (1 Hz), will be utilized. Maximum baseline lengths between control points and airborne GPS will not exceed 30 kilometers (18miles).  Quality control data will be collected within the project area using a ground-based real-time kinematic (RTK) survey, also linked to the DGPS base stations and collected with GPS rover units with kinematic corrections from fast static base stations (for RMSE of <1.5 cm).  Quality control data will be compared to the processed LiDAR data in order to ensure minimum accuracies across the project area during post processing, and are reported with metadata. An absolute RMSE is calculated for the entire study, along with percentile laser deviations.  Absolute accuracy of LiDAR data is the comparison of laser points to RTK ground level survey data.  To assess absolute accuracy, a survey more than 500 RTK GPS measurements per survey day will be conducted across multiple flight lines to compare laser points collected along a variety of surfaces (e.g., roads, under vegetation types, and across varying slopes) Absolute accuracy statistical analysis will provides root mean square errors, tests for skewness/distribution, and error percentiles.

Project Timeframe  LiDAR data must be acquired between August 19th and September 15th 2007.  The objective is to acquire data during maximum snowmelt, especially for the upper Mount Rainier areas.  Exact LiDAR data collection will occur during this time in weather windows agreed upon by Mount Rainier staff and the LiDAR provider.

<SUBJECT>66 -- HUBER Diffractometer
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NB852080-7-05720
<RESPDATE>081007
<ARCHDATE>08252007
<CONTACT>Jennifer  Roderick, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8173, Fax 301-975-8884, Email Jennifer.Roderick@nist.gov - Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Blake Industries, Incorporated, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, for the acquisition of a HUBER Diffractometer to be used at NISTs Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

***BACKGROUND***
This requirement is for equipment to upgrade a pre-existing HUBER diffractometer.  The equipment required will enable the diffractometer into a higher precision instrument, able to scan in 0.001 degree steps and collimation and alignment to better than this tolerance.  

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for compatibility and interchangeability with existing equipment currently in the laboratory.  Consisting of a translating z-stage specifically designed by HUBER to function with their diffractometer, gear stepping reducers designed specifically by HUBER to function with their diffractometer, and diffraction slits designed specifically by HUBER to function with their diffractometer, the required equipment is designed and built specifically by HUBER for alignment, precision and accuracy, and collimation of the x-ray beam.  No other company makes equipment for use with the specific HUBER diffractometer other than HUBER.  HUBER is the only manufacturer capable of providing the equipment necessary to upgrade this diffractometer.  Blake Industries is the sole distributor for the United States and Canada of HUBER diffractometer equipment.  Blake Industries is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required HUBER Diffractometer. 

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334517, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 10, 2007 will be considered by the Government.

The modification intends to extend the task order for one additional year i.e., from August 27, 2007 to August 27, 2008 to enable continuation of on-going activities within the current scope of the task order.

USAID/Egypt intends to solicit and negotiate non-competitively with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5).  This extension allows for the continuation of integral, unseverable and inseparable ongoing project activities.  There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action.  Therefore, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested persons may, however, identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to submit proposals.  The Government will consider all expressions of interest received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed task order modification based upon responses, if any, to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Semiconductor Electronics Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Oerlikon USA, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL, for the purchase of an Optical Emissions Spectrum component.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes a Nanofabrication tool from Oerlikon.  NIST requires an upgrade of an Optical Emission Spectrum (OES) component.  This OES system is required to determine the endpoint of an etch process.  With an OES upgrade, the time a user spends developing an etch recipe will be greatly reduced, and will automatically end the etch process when the stop layer is reached.  The OES system is a third party component but must be selected and installed by Oerlikon for compatibility.  Oerlikon is required to provide software that will integrate with the current system software so that the upgrade will function with the existing system as a whole.  In addition, modifications must be made to the existing tool reactor lid to accommodate the required OES system.  Based on the complexity of the equipment involved, all work for this upgrade should be conducted by the tool manufacturer.  Therefore, the upgrade must be 100 percent compatible with the existing Nanofabrication tool.  Oerlikon is the manufacturer and distributor of the existing Nanofabrication tool, and the distributor of the OES system upgrade that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333295, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 9, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Idaho for Characterization of the sortase enzyme of Renibacterium salmoninarum and its role in virulence and possibility as a target for therapeutic intervention. Aquaculture is one of the most promising and the fastest growing agri-food industry in the world. However, sustained growth of aquaculture is threatened by many bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases inflicting severe production and economic losses to the industry. Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) is a very serious systemic infection affecting salmonid fishes in commercial, resource enhancement aquaculture, in wild populations worldwide, and particularly in conservation programs designed to increase numbers of salmon currently listed under the Endangered Species Act. The causative agent of BKD is Renibacterium salmoninarum, which is a very fastidious Gram-positive intracellular bacterium. Controlling the disease by brood stock culling and erythromycin treatment has met with limited success and the efficacy of presently available attenuated live vaccines is limited. The slow-growing properties of R. salmoninarum, as well as the chronic nature of the disease that it usually causes, have contributed to the slow pace with which information on it has been gathered. In addition, other properties of the pathogen, particularly its ability to enter and survive inside eggs and phagocytic cells, have greatly complicated the task of developing methods for controlling renibacterial infections. The unavailability of an effective vaccine is mainly due to the insufficient knowledge of the virulence mechanisms of the bacteria.


I. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

a. Objective

Continued losses due to BKD continue to harm all conservation programs for salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act.  The development of improved disease control measures are of prime importance to the contractor.  The objective of the work is to identify and characterize the R. salmoninarum sortase, an enzyme that is required for expression and cell wall anchoring of cell surface proteins and virulence (Marraffini, et al. 2006).  In other Gram-positive bacteria where it has been studied, inactivation of this enzyme with a class of small molecule drugs results in an attenuated phenotype.  Thus, control of BKD could be accomplished without the necessity of antibiotics, and avoids problems of drug resistance. The work to be performed under this contract will build on and be aided by an existing project at NWFSC to sequence the genome of R. salmoninarum.  The work to be carried out will build on this project using a variety of molecular biology, microbiology, and bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize the proteins of interest.  Prior work under a previous contract has established that the sortase is functional in R. salmoninarum, and inhibition of its activity results in a reduction in the ability of the bacterium to bind to fibronectin, as well as reduces cytotoxicity, adherence, and invasion of a chinook salmon embryo cell line (CHSE-214) by the bacterium (Sudheesh, et al. in press).  

b.  Scope

The work to be carried should examine the toxicity and pharmokinetics of sortase-inhibitory drugs in salmonids, and to determine their efficacy to control BKD.  In addition, the work should include the construction of specific genetic mutants of R. salmoninarum unable to express the sortase gene, building on the working hypothesis that the sortase gene is a key component of the bacterial protein secretion system and is required for bacterial adherence and virulence.  In addition, such a mutant will aid identification of sortase substrates that may prove to be effective vaccine candidates.  Findings generated may lead to non-toxic methods to treat BKD in salmon, without the use of antibiotics.  

The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. 


This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the University of Idaho without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7166 attention to Melvin Fondue.

<SUBJECT>R -- Migration patterns and residence of Chinook salmon in Puget Sound
<SOLNBR>WASC-7-8337
<RESPDATE>080907
<ARCHDATE>08242007
<CONTACT>Melvin Fondue, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206) 526-6043, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Washington for migration patterns and residence of Chinook salmon in Puget Sound.
Introduction 

The Puget Sound Chinook salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and better knowledge of their migration patterns is critical for optimizing use of habitat restoration funds, and for fishery management and enhancement efforts.  Most Puget Sound Chinook are ?ocean-type?, migrating to sea as juveniles in their first year of life (Healey 1991), and feeding in the coastal waters from Washington to Alaska ((Myers et al. 1998).  However, anglers and fishery managers have long recognized that some ?resident? Chinook salmon, locally known as blackmouth, (Pressey 1953), remain within Puget Sound in the late fall, winter and spring.  These resident Chinook salmon have been largely ignored by scientists, who have tended to study those exhibiting the more typical migration to the coastal or open ocean zone for feeding (Healey and Groot 1987;  Quinn and Myers 2004).  Preliminary analysis of coded wire tag (CWT) data suggested a seasonal, north-south movement by immature Chinook within the Georgia Basin (Brannon and Setter 1989).  Subsequent analysis indicates that many (on the order of 25% or more) of the Puget Sound Chinook salmon exhibit this behavior in some years (O?Neill, in prep.), and that the proportion of residents varies greatly among populations (Quinn, unpublished data).  

Resident Chinook salmon will differ greatly from migratory ones in their vulnerability to local, Canadian, and Alaskan fisheries, and so a better understanding of this behavior pattern will be very useful for management.  In addition, significant efforts and being expended and planned for restoration of the Puget Sound nearshore area, and the extent to which different habitats are used by sub-adult as well as juvenile Chinook salmon will help prioritize these efforts.  In addition, recent evidence has indicated that resident Chinook salmon have much higher levels of persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs) than coastal migrants (O?Neill et al., in prep.).  Concentration of contaminants apparently takes place through the pelagic food web (O?Neill et al., in prep.), not during freshwater rearing. Consumption of residents constitutes a risk to humans (draft Department of Health report) and has been identified by NOAA-Fisheries as a likely factor contributing to the jeopardy of killer whales (Krahn et al. 2004).  Thus improved understanding of the resident behavior patterns will have ramifications for salmon conservation, the health of humans and marine mammals, and will contribute to the NOAA-Fisheries goal of developing a holistic understanding of the Puget Sound ecosystem. 
This work will increase our understanding of movement patterns & resident Chinook salmon within Puget Sound waters & the trophic connection between Chinook salmon and the southern resident community of killer whales as well as the link between elevated contaminants in resident Chinook salmon and the killer whales that eat them.  This work will use passive & active detections of ultrasonic transmitters implanted in free-ranging Chinook salmon and a network of listening stations.  


The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. 

This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the University of Washington without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication.

NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.<BR><BR>CA/CST has identified the HP DC7700 SFF Workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation is a small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation features the Intel Core 2 Duo dual-core processor. Dual core processors can deliver a substantial performance increase over single-core processors for multi-threaded applications, multi-tasking environments, or demanding single-threaded applications, allowing the user to work with noticeably quicker results. The tool-less access chassis design of the workstation is efficient, open, quiet, and easy to maintain, service, and upgrade. The dc7700 SFF workstation can be customized to fit CST requirements. 2)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality:  Hardware: •	Fujitsu fi-4220C document scanner (USB) •	Gryphon D220 barcode scanner (USB) •	Hewlett-Packard Business Inkjet 1100d printer (USB) •	NEC Multisync LCD (liquid crystal display) 1760V monitor •	PKI (public key infrastructure) (USB) •	Smiths Heimann Biometrics ACCO 1394 single fingerprint scanner (FireWire) •	Cross Match L SCAN Guardian fingerprint scanner •	Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner •	Dell UltraSharp 1905FP (flat panel) monitor Software: •	ACRS (Automated Cash Register System), version 07.00.02 •	ACS (American Citizen Services) Plus, version 1.02.01 •	CST (Consular Shared Tables), version 04.01.00 •	CST_PWD (Consular Shared Tables – Password) version 01.02.00 •	INK (Independent Name Check), version 01.02.02 •	IV (Immigrant Visa), version 04.03.00 •	NIV (Nonimmigrant Visa System), version 04.04.00 COTS Software: •	Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0 •	Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, Service Pack 2 (SP2) •	Microsoft Office 2003 Professional, Service Release 2 (SR2) •	Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition, version 10.0.2.2021 •	Oracle Client 9i •	WinZip 9.0 In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the HP dc7700 SFF workstation is procured at this time.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>**LINE ITEMS 002 & 003 MUST BE INTEGRATED WITH LINE ITEM 001 PRIOR TO SHIPMENT.

<DESC>Industry Days Information: This is an update to the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) CLS  Sustainment for FY09-FY13 Industry Days currently scheduled for 21-22 Aug  07 at Randolph AFB, TX.  For visitor access to the base, we have been  asked to consolidate a list of attendees by offeror.  Please submit the  attached form by 10 Aug 07. Updated Information: The previous contract was an IDIQ contract, and we do not plan to utilize  that contract type for the contract which results from this RFI.  The  COMBS operations which are envisioned apply solely to the AUP equipment  and include managing the supply and running the counter, they do not  include flight line maintenance.  List of LRUs included in AUP  modification is attached. Additional Information: Current Contractor:  McDonnell Douglas Corporation - A Wholly Owned  Subsidiary of the Boeing Company in St Louis MO Current Contract Number: F41608-96-D-0700 Current Contract Expires on 30 Sep 2008 TITLE:  T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program CLS Sustainment Description:  1.  337th Aeronautical System Group (337 AESG), 663d  Aeronautical Systems Squadron (663 AESS) is contemplating a competitively  awarded contract for sustainment of the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program  (AUP).  This Request for Information is intended to provide the Air Force  with an understanding of the interest within industry, the technology, and  resources available to support competitive acquisition of a contract to  cover contractor logistics support (CLS) sustainment of the avionics  suites of 450 AETC, 3 AFMC and 10 Navy T-38C AUP aircraft.  The T-38C AUP  avionics suite consists of approximately 60 non-developmental (NDI) and  commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The CLS contract will be a  firm-fixed price, performance based service contract for the logistics  support and sustainment of the T-38C AUP consisting of a base year (FY09)  and with four additional years of FFP options.  The contract will provide  for: a)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETC’s T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB and supporting operations  for Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); b)	A CLS program to repair removed components at the contractor’s (or  Original Equipment Manufacturer’s) facilities and return to COMBS, based  upon a fixed price for each of the annual number of hours flown by AETC,  AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 110,000 hours total  annually); c)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; d)	Materials for the O & A corrections; e)	Technical data and technical manuals, recommendations to responsible  engineering organization; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC Main Operating Bases,  Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS; g)	An effective Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages  Management (DMSMS) program; h)	A system that collects, manages and archives Maintenance Fault Lists  (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL)/engine,  flight loads and ACMI data for each  flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis  and could lead to product improvement; i)	A damaged equipment program; j)	In coordination with organization having systems engineering  responsibility resolve any issues involving software support, engineering  services and material deficiency reporting; k)	and the program management necessary to support these activities. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. 2.  The T-38C CLS Sustainment approach will include performance based  logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at the avionics  level, and at the LRU level (system level avionics MTBF of 60 hours).  Guaranteed part turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are  planned.  In order to comply with the COMBS turn around times, the  contractor must assure that sufficient spares are available or other  arrangements are in place to assure that these times are met. Other  metrics and your suggestions for metrics will be considered.    A  technical data package (most current configuration) will be available in  Aug/Sep 2007.  The contractor must comply with the International Traffic  in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 3.  A companion program will be managed by ASC for software and  (potentially) hardware block upgrades to the T-38C avionics suite that are  necessary to assure that the T-38C AUP continues to provide AETC with  current up-to-date training capability.  Engineering and configuration  authority thus will rest with this ASC program.  The sustainment  contractor may need to establish associate contractor agreements with the  contractor performing the block upgrades.  The sustainment contractor  should plan for a low level of engineering change proposal activity  arising from the block upgrades, DMSMS, etc. 4. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an  offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Next Generation (NexGen) CNS/ATM workstations will be addressed at a later time under separate acquisitions. Under the current acquisition for Mode S, the identifier is changed to Mode S Test and Evaluation Center (MSTEC).  The earlier ACTFAST identifier is not applicable as Mode S is a stand-alone system.  The Solicitation will be FA9302-07-R-0005 under this MSTEC requirement. The next FedBizOpps posting will be under the new solicitation number and identified as MSTEC.  An Aug 2007 posting will be the formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  Offerors will have thirty (30) calendar days to provide complete proposals.  It is anticipated it will be a best value source selection.  Further, that all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.  However, price will contribute substantially to the award decision.  The Government anticipates a ceiling price of no more than $5M under the Mode S acquisition with award of contract in Nov 2007.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) and CDRLs that are specific to the Mode S requirements are part of this posting.  Industry is encouraged to provide any comments on the attached draft SOW and CDRLs.  Responses to the draft SOW and CDRLs will be addressed to joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil and are due no later than 4:00 PM (local time) on 06 Aug 2007.  Industry is reminded that all future postings to FedBizOpps will be under Mode S Test and Evaluation Center and Solicitation FA9302-07-R-0005.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to delete reference to the Subcontracting Plan in previous FedBizOpps announcement dated 7/25/07.  Delete the following paragraph in it entirety: Small Business Goals:  If a large business, the prime contractor sha ll provide its small business subcontracting plan conrorming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7.  The small business goals are as follows:  Small Business 51.71%, Small Disadvantaged Business 8.89%, HUBzone Small Business 7.37%, Women-Owned Small Business 3.13%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3%, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 2.0%.  A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated, shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumst ances of why the goal cannot be met.  You may contact the District, Deputy Small Business advocate or your local SBA for assistance.   A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum  practicable opportunities for Small, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business and Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance.

<ARCHDATE>10242007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Donald MacGee, Contract Specialist, 617-494-2803
<DESC>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is seeking access to domestic and international airline schedule data required by the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS).  This data set is important for the mission of ETMS.  ETMS is an operational FAA system providing the means by which the FAA can monitor and control air traffic.  As such, the ETMS relies upon schedule airline data to allow the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and other traffic managers to effectively and safely manage the nations airports and airspace.  Current and accurate flight schedule information is used in the ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC and specialists to predict traffic problems and avoid delays by implementing national traffic management initiatives.  Without this data areas could become overloaded and compromise air safety.  The nature of the required services demands that the ETMS have continuous and reliable schedule flight data worldwide. Volpe Center, as the ETMS Hubsite, has subscribed schedule flight data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) Worldwide, Inc. for years.  ETMS has developed software to read the OAG files and process the airline schedule data with historical flight path data to produce a new ETMS Schedule Database (SDB).  ETMS uses the SDB to provide schedule information to the traffic managers. The Volpe Center is seeking capability information on schedule flight data in the form mentioned under Capability Requirements below.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or qualifications.  The information must show that any interested party has the ability to provide the requisite services, data and operational support that meet the following Government requirements: ETMS Schedule Flight Data Requirements The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and services, except otherwise specified, to provide subscription services of the worldwide schedule flight data as specified below. 1.	Weekly Bulk Data transmission The Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated between the Volpe Center and the Contractor. The range of the data shall be for 45 days. The following fields are required in each weekly delivery: Leave Country Code FAA Airport Code GMT Leave Time Arrival Country Code FAA Airport Code GMT Arrival Time Flag Code Equipment Code FAA Carrier Code Flight Number Days of Service Category Effective Date Discontinue Date As part of the subscription service, the Contractor shall provide changes to the bulk data file as stated below: Provide effective and discontinue dates. If there is no effective date available the date reverts to the first day of the delivered data files.  If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data.  There are to be no assumptions. Provide a carrier code in the carrier code field when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table. This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table. Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records. Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period. Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide. Provide all segments of scheduled flight records.  There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport.  The second segment of this flight should be included. The Volpe Center currently receives the worldwide flight schedule data on a weekly file on each Wednesday.  In addition to that, Volpe Center receives three support reports. Daylight Savings Time File If the validity of the worldwide schedules file crosses a Daylight Savings Time event, the contractor shall provide a support file which contains the following:  Carriers affected by DST event Time Divisions affected by DST event Data used for performing DST Not Actioned job Flights affected by DST event Production Run Totals File A file provides the totals of each weekly production run.  Unresolved FAA Codes File A file will be provided on a weekly basis that outlines any unresolved FAA Carrier Codes.  The file should show the carrier names that do not have FAA Codes.  It should outline the carrier name and their International Air transport Association (IATA) codes.   2.	Quarterly Bulk Aircraft/City Tracking System (ACTS) Files The contractor shall provide a copy of airlines equipment and airports updated during the previous quarter (Quarterly Codes file).  The Volpe Center currently receives one single quarterly file in March, June, September and December. The Quarterly Codes file should include the following fields: The first two records on the file are Header Records identified with UHL1 and UHL2.  These records contain the filename, date of creation and copyright information. Equipment Code and Airport Code Locations Records follow in order labeled below: Equipment Code Records Equipment End Record Airport Code Location Record End Record The Equipment Code Record contains the IATA assigned code, equipment type and equipment name. The Airport Code Location Record contains the airport and city code, the longitude and latitude coordinates for the airports, the airport and city name, UTC difference between local time at the city or airport and Greenwich, England and a country code which refers to the DOT World Airways Code List. 3.	DATA TRANSMISSION The contractor shall have the capability to transmit the data to the ETMS receiving site via reliable, robust and independent communication line.  The files will be placed in a directory on a host machine, which can be accessed remotely by Volpe Center staff. Files provided by the contractor shall be compatible with existing ETMS receiving equipment.  If not, the contractor shall specify and offer standard off-the-shelf equipment to receive the files and interface with ETMS. Current ETMS SDB file format is proprietary to the current long time contractor OAG, Worldwide, Inc. The file structure for the bulk data transmission files shall be: ASCII	 Sequential File 56 characters per line The contractor shall provide the schedule flight data in a digital stream for direct input into the existing ETMS SDB software for processing.  The contractor shall make provisions that the data feed may have to interface with the ETMS firewall as the point of demarcation, if requested. Also, the data feed shall be supported by an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and a backup generator power at the contractors facility, if requested. System Availability and Reliability All subscribed data must be available at the receiving site at scheduled delivery time. Availability means the data, if they are available to the contractor, are received by the receiving site within the update interval 99.99% of the time. Capability Requirements All responsible sources may respond to this Sources Sought Notice and responses will be fully considered by the Agency.  Interested firms are required to demonstrate that its schedule flight data is compatible with ETMS by supplying a sample data set in a CD ROM at no cost to the Government, and two (2) copies of document that describes in sufficient detail, the files, the types and formats of the files and any special software and/or requirements to access the files in the CD so as to allow an evaluation of a bonafide capability to satisfy the Governments requirements by August 15, 2007.  The weekly schedule flight data shall begin at 0000Zulu on a Wednesday thats (40)( 5 )days before April 2, 2006 so as to allow for the capability of handling daylight savings time. The Volpe Center expects a total of four weekly files.  The quarterly data shall cover December 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006. Volpe Center expects one quarterly file.  In addition to test for the compatibility of the data and the ETMS SDB software, Volpe Center and ETMS shall check for accuracy of the data and completeness of the sample data set versus the worldwide schedule flight data set Volpe Center is currently subscribing.  Do not include any pricing information.  Please send documentation to the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attn: Donald MacGee, RTV-6D2, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA  02142-1093.

        services or an integrator?  If you were an integrator how 
        many sub-contractors did you manage?
4.	How would the requirement be met for vision testing of 
        applicants in the U.S.?
5.	Since the tests may occur anywhere throughout the United 
        States, would it be easier to segregate the requirement by 
        geographical regions?  If so, do you have any suggestions 
        on we should define the regions?  If so, can you price each 
        of the required tests by regions?
6.	There is a slight possibility that tests may be required 
        OCONUS.   Given the requirements, would this require 
        additional turnaround time for the results?
7.	We are looking at the possibility of pricing each of the  
        tests on a firm fixed price basis.  Is this possible?  If 
        not, how would you recommend we structure the pricing -  by  
        test, by region?  If firm fixed price is not recommended, 
        what pricing arrangement would you propose for the MRO, 
        coordinator and for the individual tests?  Cost 
        reimbursable? Time and Materials?
8.	Do you currently have someone available that meets the 
        requirements of a Medical Review Officer (MRO)?  If not, 
        how would your company meet this requirement?
9.	Because of the unknowns of when and where the services will 
        be required, would a Blanket Purchase Agreement be 
        appropriate?
10.	NGA requires a two-week turnaround for reported results, is 
        this reasonable?
11.	Would your company be able to price this effort for more 
        than one year?  If so, how many years would you recommend?

<DESC>A.General Information

TRICARE Southwest Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in California announces a re-posting of the Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Wound Catheters, Drains & Drainage Systems. This supersedes Solicitation Number: Reference Number ? N002597046SS01. The product category includes catheters (drainage, thoracic, those with trocars, etc), drains (penrose, jackson pratt, flat, etc), and drainage systems (pleurevac, hemovac, j-vac, dry/wet suction, etc) used to drain blood and fluids from wounds and incisions in the body after trauma or surgical procedures.  Due to the specificity of products within the category, a multiple RIA award is possible.  

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.
 
The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is January 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.

Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  The responses will be reviewed by the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

Phase II.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 10 business days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (10th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.1 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.1 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southwest Region.  Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  However, alternate (tiered) pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only South Carolina Educational Television (SCETV), 1101 George Rogers Blvd., Columbia, SC  29201, on a sole source basis for the maintenance of National Weather Service (NWS) VHF equipment located on South Carolina Educational Television owned towers and buildings in the state of South Carolina.  Period of performance will be 01 October 2007 through 30 September 2008 with four one-year option periods.  The FSC for this is J058, the NAICS is 517910 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  
The contractor shall provide all maintenance and maintenance support services for 14 NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitter systems at various locations throughout the state of South Carolina.  The contractor shall perform routine maintenance four times a year.  Upon completion of routine maintenance, the transmitter system will be fully operational and functional at the authorized output power as measured at the input to the transmission line, within the required frequency and modulation tolerance, and in compliance will all technical descriptions and specifications in NWR operational specifications and requirements, and the OEM equipment manuals.  The contractor shall monitor, via dial-in government furnished software, all transmitters on a monthly basis to verify that parameters are within specifications.  The contractor will accomplish all corrective maintenance identified by the contractor or requested via a service call by the National Weather Service (NWS).  All service calls shall be answered and responded to 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  All site outages shall be corrected so that the Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) per site will not exceed 12 consecutive hours.  Maintenance will be provided so that no Contractor maintained transmitter system will experience site outage in excess of 88 hours per year.  A transmitter site configured with a dual transmitter is considered in a degraded operational mode if either transmitter is not capable of operating at its full authorized power.  The contractor will perform corrective maintenance on a degraded site within 48 hours of notice and restore it to full operation within 72 hours.  The NWS and the Contractor shall perform annual signal strength measurements to ensure that overall system performance has not deteriorated.  The signal strength measurements shall be made at a minimum of four different land locations approximately 90 degrees apart and a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 statute miles from the transmitter site.  The time interval between the annual measurements shall be from 9 to 13 months.  The Contractor shall provide the NWR focal point within 24 hours of completion of any maintenance on a contractor maintained system.  
In an effort to ensure that the NWS carries out its mission of providing warnings and forecasts directly to the public to protect life and property, the NWS operates the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) network to provide continuous transmission of recorded weather and appropriate all-hazards warning information to the public.  The NWR is linked to the National Emergency Alert System and the Homeland Security's All Hazard Warning System, which enables the NWS to reach more people with timely, site-specific severe weather warning.  South Carolina Educational Television is a key participant in South Carolina's Emergency Alert System, and the Homeland Security?s All Hazard Warning System.  To ensure preparedness and the capability to respond at all levels, it is critical that SCETV interface regularly with local and federal counterparts.  Communication systems located at SCETV include the NOAA Weather Radio Systems, digital and direct land lines to South Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD), FM transmitters, and microwave broadcasting equipment, linking SCETV to commercial radio and television stations throughout the state.  Fourteen NWRs are mounted on SCETV-owned towers because a proportion of South Carolina residents are not within listening range of an NWR station and SCETV has existing transmitting towers in these remote locations and is a participant of the EAS and the All Hazard Warning System.  Due to the sensitive and secure broadcast equipment each transmitter tower contains, SCETV only grants access to State-commissioned employees.    
The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by June 1, 2007.  Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 664-3653.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within ten days after publication of this notice.  Evidence must be provided of the ability to provide required services.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  To be eligible for award, offerors must have a valid DUNS Number and be registered n the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

The US Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC),  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking to test Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)  from alternate product sources that currently meet the requirements of the  Excalibur IMU Performance Specification, and Electrical Interface Control  Document, or hereon known as the IMU Spec and ICD.  An IMU is a 6 degree-of- freedom digital inertial measurement subsystem that is a component of a  navigation system and which consists of 6 micro-machined silicon sensors; 3- accelerometers and 3-gyros.  The IMU Spec and ICD have limited distribution to  DOD contractors; therefore, in order to receive this documentation, interested  sources must be US DOD contractors and provide DOD certification to the  Government. Upon receipt of this verification, two documents will be sent to  the authorized contractor.  These documents describe the IMU functional,  physical, and environmental requirements for operation in precision-guided,  155mm cannon-launched artillery projectiles.  Without these two documents,  interested sources cannot offer information pertaining to the subsequent  questions. All responses to this market survey are required to be in English. Once DOD  certification has been received by the USG and the two documents have been  sent, all interested parties must provide requested information and data in  response to the following:  a.	Provide evidence that IMU design meets or exceeds the majority of the  requirements of the IMU Spec and ICD. b.	Provide summary of IMU Spec and ICD requirements that are not currently  met and also the predicted timeframe and cost for meeting them.  c.	Provide test evidence of meeting requirements of the IMU S pec both  before and after firing in 155mm cannon-based artillery systems with emphasis  on meeting or exceeding the objective of 15,750 G launch-acceleration. d.	Provide evidence of being able to produce 3-9 units within 6 weeks of  purchase order and for completing post-gun shock performance testing within 2  weeks of return of units. e.	Provide product delivery schedule and cost for 500 and 1,000 units per  year. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).

All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to  the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in  part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The  Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this  survey.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures with an estimated total award value of less than $100,000. The Protected Resources Division of the Pacific Islands Regional Office of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Honolulu, HI intends to acquire the following service for the island of Maui.  The vendor must be within the local commuting area.

Project: Building Marine Mammal Response (Hawaiian Monk Seal and Cetacean Stranding) Capacity for the Island of Maui in Cooperation with Hawaii Pacific University under the Direction of NOAA NMFS Pacific Islands Regional Network. 

Background
Hawaiian Monk seals
Hawaiian monk seals occur principally in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and are one of the world?s most endangered seals.  In recent years, however, their numbers have increased significantly in the main Hawaiian Islands, particularly on the islands of Niihau and Kauai.  Recent surveys suggest that at least 100 seals may now occupy the main Hawaiian Islands.  While this increase raises promising new prospects for the species? recovery, it also poses new management challenges.  For example, monk seals haul out and give birth on popular recreational beaches where they are subject to harassment by people, and on at least two occasions in the past two years, seals have bitten swimmers.  Restricting human use of popular beaches could have significant impacts on local tourism-based economies.  
To address these issues, steps were taken to increase public awareness of monk seals: posting temporary safety zones around hauled-out seals to keep people from approaching; moving selected weaned pups from populated beaches to more remote areas; and, on one occasion, temporarily closing a popular public beach to protect a mother-pup pair.  Clear guidance on how to address different types of haul-out situations in the main Hawaiian Islands is now in the process of being developed.
NMFS has lead responsibility under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act for protecting monk seals.  However, NMFS has been severely limited in addressing issues in the main Hawaiian Islands due in large part to limited staff and funding. Therefore, with little or no funding, state and local agency officials, volunteers, environmental groups, and local businesses have stepped forward to provide valuable assistance to protect hauled-out seals

Cetacean Strandings 
Strandings are important indicators of cetacean population health and using cetaceans as apex species, strandings can be indicators of ocean health.  Each stranding carries with it strong conservation messages as many are related to anthropogenic (human induced) causes. Cetaceans can become entangled in nets, derelict fishing gear, and other marine debris such as plastics. Cetaceans are also known to swallow plastics and collide with vessels. These are all impacts that people can prevent by changing their behaviors in and near the water. Cetaceans may also strand due to natural causes such as old age, disease, and predation. 
Marine Mammal Response consists of: 
?	Monk seal haulouts/public outreach, seal birthing events (pup rearing monitoring, emergency stranding response). 
?	Cetacean strandings. 
?	Cetacean entanglements, including assistance with and logistical support of large entangled whales and whales struck by vessels
?	Oil spills and Unusual Mortality Events (UME's) of marine mammals.
Hawaiian Monk Seal Response Program
Monk seal response programs exist on Kauai, Oahu, Maui and the Big Island with some reporting from Molokai and Lanai. Volunteer programs are in place to routinely assist NMFS PIRO and the Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) in monk seal response issues. Volunteers assist with the following: 
The term response here takes many forms: 
?	Simply responding to a call of a hauled out monk seal to verify and assess the situation. 
?	Creating a Seal Protection Zone (see protocols) around a seal that is on a popular beach
?	Collecting sightings information and providing it to PIFSC.monksealsighting@noaa.gov
?	Assisting PIRO and PIFSC staff with the relocation of a seal
?	Responding to verify that a seal that is in trouble (hooked or entangled) or otherwise communicate with and refer special cases to designated leaders and/or to the NOAA Hotline for Hawaii 888-256-9840
?	Responding to a haul out, taking digital images and sending them to PIRO and/or PIFSC
?	Offering public passersby information about the Hawaiian monk seal and its endangered status as instructed, about:
?	Hawaiian monk seals
?	Basic biology and behavior
?	Viewing guidelines
?	Management actions
Cetacean Stranding Program
In Hawaii, PIRO oversees the local cetacean stranding network which is part of a National Stranding Network which includes all US states that border the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico. 

In Hawaii, two primary entities have NMFS authorization to respond to and "take" marine mammals for rescue, rehabilitation, release of live cetaceans and necropsy and sampling of those that wash ashore dead or those that strand alive but die or are humanely euthanized. Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) is designated to respond to and sample dead stranded cetaceans and Sea Life Park by Dolphin Discovery (SLPDD) is designated to respond to and care for live cetaceans with the goal of release back to the wild. 

Goals and Objectives 
The goal of this contract is to build the necessary capacity for monk seal response and cetacean stranding response and to assist organizations and programs described above that are needed on Island of Maui. To accomplish this goal, NOAA PIRO seeks to achieve the following objectives with this contract:
1.	Expand the capacity of marine mammal response on Hawaii by hiring a contractual coordinator for a term of 24 months.  
2.	Build the capacity to demonstrate appropriate response to marine mammal situations 
3.	Outreach and messaging will be disseminated to the public in various forums using various outreach tools 
Specific Tasks 
The contractor (Island Coordinator) will be responsible for performing the following tasks in cooperation with Hawaii Pacific University under the direction of the NOAA PIRO MMRN Coordinator:
?	Coordinate locally the response to seal haulouts and pupping events on the island of Maui which will include but not be limited to providing daily or weekly updates on the seal mother pair (progress, harassment, and nursing and behavioral data). 
?	If possible travel to a neighbor island to assist with a pupping event.
?	Develop a recruitment plan for community involvement in marine mammal response and work to develop zones of response with a phone tree around the island of Maui
?	Recruit, train, and coordinate volunteers responding to marine mammal events and evaluate response
?	Provide updated articles for the MMRN newsletter as requested.
?	Create a forum for regularly getting information to volunteers through meetings along with a website.
?	Develop equipment lists, caches and storage areas for strategic locations around Hawaii
?	Develop community outreach programs for schools, resorts and condos, festivals and fairs, and others. These programs should be transferable to teachers and others to continue the presentation and evaluation of the programs beyond the scope of this contractual project
?	Develop a protocol with assistance from the MMRNC for the
     	       retrieval and final disposition of cetacean carcasses including:
-	place for necropsies near or at UH 
-	plan for carcass retrieval and transport
-	plan for burial or incineration
j.    Develop plans for live cetacean response and transport.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking to increase opportunities for collaboration with other government agencies, industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) that leverage LaRC's core competencies in Atmospheric Sciences, Laser/Lidar remote sensing, and passive remote sensing.  This teaming opportunity solicits potential partners for the collaborative development of proposal(s) to the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP).  Information on this NASA Call for Proposals is available at the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (http://prod.nais.nasa.gov) and Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) Web Sites under the Title FY2007 IPP SEED FUND CALL ANNOUNCEMENT posted on May 10, 2007. NASA LaRC is specifically seeking Partner(s) to participate with NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to develop and execute a proposal(s) for the following technical area:  Novel Platforms that can take instruments to new vantage points.  Of particular interest are technologies that enable long-duration observations from suborbital vantage points. Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at LaRC.  LaRC anticipates selecting partners with whom LaRC would then immediately work directly and individually to finalize proposals. During the proposal development phase, more specific roles and cost estimates for the selected partners will be developed. For any LaRC proposal that is selected by NASA Headquarters, LaRC intends to award contract(s) or other agreements with each selected partner.  It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates.	Potential partner(s) must demonstrate capabilities and experience in the technical area proposed.  Partner(s) must work collaboratively with NASA.     Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant science experience and past performance in similar activities and mission science teams.	Provide a description of relevant experience including a summary of significant achievements and key publications.	Each offeror shall specifically discuss the relevance of their experience in reference to the technical areas described above.  Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar research/developments should be included.   (2) Technical Capability and Personnel: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s technical capability to perform the research/development, and the availability of personnel to perform the duties.  The offeror shall describe the technical capability, availability and adequacy of key personnel for the proposal and the mission.  (3) Cost sharing: The Call for Proposals requires non-NASA partner(s) to provide cost-sharing at a level equal to or greater than the IPP Seed Fund dollars provided to the project.  This criterion evaluates the offeror's extent and type of cost sharing proposed and their commitment to do so.     (4) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (5) Facilities: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration proposed. The offeror should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  It is expected that the teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal development process and that selection of the proposal for implementation would result in contracts, other agreements or grants for the selected partner(s). This teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contract, agreement or grant nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), consultation, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the proposal development guidelines as described in the relevant AO.  RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to seven (5) pages in not less than 12-point font.

<SUBJECT>--FREE WIDE AREA WORKFLOW(WAWF) VENDOR TRAINING IN MOLINE ILLINOIS AUGUST 13-17, 2007
<DESC>Dear Vendor, The Department of Army, The Procurement Technical Assistant Centers (PTAC), The US Small Business Administration (SBA) and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) are collaborating to facilitate the implementation of the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) sys tem to support electronic invoice and receiving report processing. As we implement the government side of this system, we are strongly encouraging our vendors to begin using WAWF as well. This will lead to the eventual elimination of the paper flow of docu ments associated with the receipt and acceptance business practice. Vendor Classroom Training  DFAS along with the Illinois SBA and SBDC will be providing FREE WAWF training classes in Moline, Illinois according to the schedule below.  Classes are 8 hours long and you only need to attend one class.  August 13th August 14th August 15th August 16th August 17th Using WAWF for Vendors is an instructor-led class that includes comprehensive instruction on basic WAWF functionality, hands-on practice and a detailed reference guide for you to take back to your work site.

If you are unable to attend because of schedule conflicts or limited classroom capacity, refer to the section Other WAWF Training Opportunities below. The resources listed are adequate tools to help prepare you to use WAWF. What is WAWF? WAWF is a convenient online solution that allows vendors to electronically submit invoices and receiving reports, allows the Government to perform inspection and acceptance of goods and services, and allows DFAS to receive transactions electr onically. With WAWF, your company can: Directly submit invoices and receiving reports real-time via the Internet, File Transfer Protocol, or Direct Electronic Data Interchange. Expedite payment due to the reduction of lost or misplaced documents and quicker document routing. Gain total visibility of document and payment statuses for services rendered on your contract(s). Receive system-generated e-mails advising you of action taken by the government inspection and acceptance officials, to include document rejection. Why use WAWF? In 2001, the government passed a law stating that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense must use an electronic method for submitting invoices and supporting documentation (Public Law 106-398). In 2003, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) was updated to include DFARS Clause 252.232.7003. This clause requires the use of electronic invoicing tools and has been inserted into many of the contracts you currently hold with the government. How Can You Get Started?  To help you start WAWF today, we offer helpful electronic Commerce information, including the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide that will walk you through all the steps necessary to help you begin using WAWF, on the DFAS E-comme rce website: http://www.dfas.mil/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html Other WAWF Learning Opportunities WAWF Web-Based Training Site.  http://www.wawftraining.com.

Brand name justification:

FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supplies are available from only the original source; this is a follow-on contract for the continued development of the HSPD-12 Compliant Digital fingerprint system network for the Department.  Unacceptable delays would result if different brand(s) of fingerprint systems were to be purchased.  Examining and testing of different systems would obviously cause a delay, whereas the Identix systems can be integrated immediately.  Identix is the OEM.  
Homeland Security Presidential Directive ? 12 (HSPD-12) mandates that all Federal Employees with 15 years of employment and less, and all Contractors must have completed the proper Suitability Assessments and Background Investigations for their positions by October 27, 2007. Along with this process, all government agencies must be able to issue PIV-II compliant Identification cards by the same date. In order to properly conduct these investigations and issue these new ID cards each Federal Employee and Contractor must be fingerprinted on Systems that are able to capture digital images of their prints, forward them to OPM and retain a portion of those images as a reference for issuing the ID cards. 
After considering various equipment options, HHS determined that the Identix Fingerprinting equipment would be the Departmental standard.  In October of 2006, the Department issued a confirmation that the Identix HSPD-12 Compliant Digital Fingerprinting System was to be used exclusively by the Department as a means of capturing, transmitting and retaining digital fingerprints. Since that time, eight HHS agencies have been working closely with Identix to acquire their own fingerprinting systems, so that they may be in line with the Departmental decision on the respective equipment vendor.
The Program Support Center (PSC) has already purchased and deployed 14 of these HSPD-12 Compliant Digital Fingerprinting Systems from Identix.  To support the nationwide demand on all Federal Agencies to be compliant with HSPD-12, it has been determined that the above 8 additional systems need to be purchased and deployed.  
PSC currently has Systems set up in Rockville, DC and all 10 Regions. All of which, have gone through the proper Security Credentialing and Accreditation Process.  PSC has established a deadline of July, 2007 for the delivery of these new Systems so that proper integration of this new equipment into the already existing network can be accomplished.

Offers are due on Friday, July 27 @ 2:00 pm. EST electronically to the Contract Specialist.

Please contact Marc Long, Contract Specialist, 301-443-7086, regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Honolulu, HI to provide Satellite-Linked Data Recorders for Marine Turtle Research 2007.

INTRODUCTION ? The Fishery Biology and Stock Assessment Division, Pacific  Islands Fisheries  Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, conducts research on sustainable fishing, including fisheries bycatch reduction, and provides technical assistance to researchers doing similar work in other countries.   As such, research on reducing the incidental capture of sea turtles and determining the impacts of fisheries interactions on sea turtle movements and survivorship is a high priority. In an effort to track sea turtles after their release from fishing gear, we intend to purchase satellite telemetry devices that will provide information on the post-release behaviors in order to estimate the effects of fisheries interactions on the population status of threatened and endangered hard-shelled sea turtles that are vulnerable to becoming hooked or entangled in fishing gear.
 

We therefore seek to acquire satellite transmitters that can be mounted on the carapace of sea turtles and that have the capability to record and transmit information on vertical and horizontal movements of turtles after they are released from fishing gear.  The following statement of work is for satellite data recorders that will collect and transmit information via satellite on hard-shelled sea turtles after their release from fishing gear.

 
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS - The satellite transmitters will be attached to sub-adult hard-shelled sea turtles, most probably loggerhead turtles, so they must be small to minimize the effects of the instruments on the animals.  The order will include tags of two types, one (?Tag Type 1?) that transmits horizontal movement data as well as time-at-temperatures profiles. Geolocation data (calculated by Argos as latitude and longitude positions by Doppler shift), and a second type (?Tag Type 2?) that transmits geolocation (similar to Tag Type 1), temperature, as well as depth. Specifications are required both tag types (Tag Types 1 and 2).

 

? Must weigh less than 250 grams in air, and measure less than 165 mm (L) x 40 mm (W) x 34 mm (H).

                ? Tags must have the capability of transmitting at 0.5W radiated power.

                ? Tags must have battery configuration to provide 50,000+ Argos transmissions.

                ? To extend and control deployment length, tags must:              

- Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water;   

                                - Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month;

- Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day;      

- Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view;

? Tags must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 500 m of water. 

? Tag Type 1 must provide time at temperature profiles.

? Tag Type 2 must provide, at a minimum, the following types of data messages, selectable by the user:         

- Dive duration histograms: Number of dives within the specified dive duration ranges;

- Maximum dive depth histograms: Number of dives whose maximum depth is within the specified depth ranges;

- Time-at-depth histograms: Time spent within the specified depth ranges;

Time spent within the specified temperature range;

- Percentage timelines: What percentage of the hour the tag was above a user-specified threshold depth, or dry;

- 20-minute timelines: Each 24 hour period is divided into 20-minute increments. Each increment is marked with whether it was generally deeper than a configurable depth, or was dry;

 

? Tag Type 2 must allow programmable collection of data. If possible, depth data should be at 0.5 m resolution. Other data, such as temperature and wet/dry periods, should be summarized and compressed into histograms for transmission through the Argos system.  The numbers of bins (up to 14 per histogram), the bin cut-points, the period of coverage (1-24 hours), and the starting time of each histogram must be user programmable.             

 

?All user programming and control of tags (Types 1 and 2) must be provided through included software that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  At least two sets of cables and other hardware required for programming/controlling the tags must be provided.  Windows-based software must be provided for user decoding of the Argos data into an easy-to-read format.

 

DELIVERY SCHEDULE ?

Tag Type 1: 10 tags to be delivered on or before 10 December, 2007.

Tag Type 2:   6 tags to be delivered on or before 10 December, 2007. 
All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to 206-527-7166 attention Melvin Fondue

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Seattle, WA to provide:
 
Tooth ageing and age at length modeling

The age at death of beach cast carcasses and harvested animals provide important information necessary to interpret cause of death and other necropsy results and to include population models to estimate survival rates and population viability.  In addition, where length and gender are known the age at length relationship for the population can be determined and used to estimate the age of individuals for which teeth are not available.  Currently NMFS has jaws and teeth for 30-35 individuals that require ageing.  When these ages are completed the data can be combined with data from approximately 40 other individuals to estimate length at age curves for males, females and unknown gender.   This contract will provide funding to age 4 to 10 teeth for up to 35 individuals following the protocol in Vos (2003), complete analysis of the results with previous results and prepare a document for peer review.
  
Research Plan

Contractor will age 4 to 10 teeth for up to 35 individuals (teeth and jaws provided by NMFS) following the protocol in Vos (2003).  A second reader will be provided by NMFS at no cost to the contract.  Teeth will be identified by individual and location on the jaw and sufficient teeth will be analyzed for each jaw to allow subsequent analysis of the optimal location in the jaw for aging by a single tooth.  Contractor will review and where necessary confirm identity and lengths of samples with original field collection data provided by NMFS. 

Results will be combined with an existing dataset (provided by NMFS) including approximately 40 individuals and will be analyzed to identify the best location on the jaw for aging by a single tooth and estimate age and length curves.  Analysis will include, overall characteristics of the data, comparison of readers, comparison of left and right jaws, comparison of tooth positions 1 to 10 and age/length curves for male, females and gender unknown individuals.

Products and deliverables:

Contractor will provide to NMFS a report and database with the complete results for the ageing of each tooth and the data to be used for the age at length models.

Contractor will prepare a manuscript describing the results for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

COST


Narative:    It is anticipated that the work will be completed in Alaska so a ? COLA is included and ?% overhead,  and  hourly rate at $____/hr.  We anticipate that 520 hours will be required to complete the analysis of the teeth and prepare the database and 280 hours are required to complete the analysis, prepare a manuscript and consult on the results.  Contractor is expected to travel to Seattle to consult with Dr. Hobbs regarding application of the ageing results to population models.

All contractor personnel assigned to this contract shall possess security clearances issued by the Defense Security (DSS) commensurate with their required level of access to classified information.  Interim Secret clearances are acceptable for Secret information with the exception of RD, CNWDI, SCI and NATO Information.  Final clearances are required for those categories.  Final Top Secret clearances are required for access to TS information (interim clearances are not acceptable.)  Specifically designated contractor employees must also be eligible for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), in accordance with DCID 6/4, at U.S. Government facilities.  DCID 6/4 waivers will not be considered unless an extreme emergency exists. b. The contractor shall also possess DSS-approved safeguarding capability for Secret classified information in performance of this contract.  All automated processing of classified information must be accomplished on DSS-approved information systems. c. DHS has determined that performance of this contract requires that the contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (collectively herein known as 'contractor'), requires access to classified National Security Information (herein known as classified information). Classified information is government information that requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, and supplementing directives. The contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for the protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the contractor has access to classified information at a DHS or other government facility, it shall abide by the requirements set by the agency. ii. Implementing Instructions for Compliance with HSAR clause 3052.204-71 'Contractor Employee Access' a. General Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) clause 3052.204-71 requires that contractor personnel requiring unescorted access to government facilities, access to sensitive information, or access to government information technology (IT) resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy requires a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract for all contractor personnel who require recurring access to government facilities or access to sensitive information, or access to government IT resources.
Contractor employees will be given a suitability determination unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.  Requirements for suitability determination are defined in paragraph 3.0. b. Additional Information for Classified Contracts Performance of this contract requires the Contractor to gain access to classified National Security Information (includes documents and material).  Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, National Security Information (NSI) as amended and supplemental directives. The Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, an attachment to the contract, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the Contractor is required to have access to classified information at a DHS or other Government Facility, it shall abide by the requirements set forth by the agency. c. General Requirement The Contractor shall ensure these instructions are expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this contract. d. Contractor Personnel(1) Employment Eligibility To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy, the contractor must complete the following forms for applicable personnel who will be performing work under this contract as indicated: *Standard Form (SF) 85P, 'Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions' *FD-258 fingerprint cards *DHS Form 11000-6, 'Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement'. Required of all applicable contractor personnel.  *DHS Form 11000-9, 'Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'. (2) Continued Eligibility

(3) Termination The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence.  The Contractor shall return to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report shall be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to who it was issued and the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. e. Suitability Determination DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary suitability checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow.  A favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar DHS from withdrawing or terminating access government facilities or information, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office. Contract employees waiting for an EOD decision may begin work on the contract provided they do not access sensitive Government information.  Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the Contractor is escorted by a Government employee.  This limited access is to allow Contractors to attend briefings, non-recurring meetings and begin transition work. f. Background Investigations Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, requiring access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through the DHS Security Office.  Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the DHS Security Office.  The Standard Form 85P will be completed electronically, through the Office of Personnel Management's e-QIP SYSTEM.

Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract. Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department's Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted: *The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U. S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State; *There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U. S. citizen; and *The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government. g. Alternative Citizenship Requirements for Non-IT Contracts For non-Classified or non-IT contracts the above citizenship provision shall be replaced with the citizenship provision below: Each individual employed under the contract shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by a Permanent Resident Card (USCIS I-55 1). Any exceptions must be approved by the Department's Chief Security Officer or designee. h. Information Technology Security Clearance When sensitive government information is processed on Department telecommunications and automated information systems, the Contractor shall provide for the administrative control of sensitive data being processed. Contractor personnel must have favorably adjudicated background investigations commensurate with the defined sensitivity level. Contractors who fail to comply with Department security policy are subject to having their access to Department IT systems and facilities terminated, whether or not the failure results in criminal prosecution.  Any person who improperly discloses sensitive information is subject to criminal and civil penalties and sanctions under a variety of laws (e.g., Privacy Act). Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access. i. Information Technology Security Training and Oversight Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS. j.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following technical factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Personnel Qualifications:  Key person(s) possesses training in both accounting, finance, business, and the physical sciences and has relevant experience providing acquisition and finance support for a science based federal government program. 2.

Personnel Qualifications is the most important factor. E. Technical Capability and Approach and Past Performance are approximately equal in importance. F.

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). H. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. I.  Questions about the solicitation shall be submitted via email by 7/31/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST to John Nash at john.nash@dhs.gov. J. Proposals shall be submitted via email by 8/3/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST to John Nash at john.nash@dhs.gov.  Late submissions will not be considered.

<DESC>Question:  Request for clarification and explanation of the term ?pilot? in the Statement of Work.

Answer:  In order to receive a vendor-issued certificate in change management, the student  will have to successfully complete and fully participate in the three-day program. It is the intent that the vendor will issue the certificate during the final section of the class.  Receipt of this certification should mean that the student will be well positioned to lead change or be an active participant in the aspects of change resulting from a new process or system within his or her division or organization. In order to teach methods of managing change, the instructor will use actual research and best practice examples from public and private sector organizations which have managed change resulting from the introduction of new processes and systems. As teaching aids, the instructor will introduce and explain valuable user-friendly tools such as real-life examples, proven methodologies and templates which will help the student learn how to walk through and manage the change process. The instructor will share common tasks which best practice organizations have used to help manage change. 

As stated in the SOW, prior to the start of the class, students will be asked to summarize a project on which they are currently involved or an upcoming project in which they will have a leadership role. Throughout the three-day session, the students will be expected to use this project as a pilot to help them understand the various aspects of change which accompany the introduction of new processes or systems and help them learn how to manage it with great success.
