<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />The following is an answers to a questions received from potential offeror. The answers provide clarification only and DO NOT constitute an amendment to the solicitation.
<p>Question: Do you have an anticipated award date for this solicitation?<br />Answer: The estimated award date is prior to 17 November; however, a site visit of the property needs to be completed which may delay the award.</p>
<p>Question: The per diem for Virginia Beach increase significantly for the months of June, July and August, the time period for apartment use occurs during those months. If we attempt to average the amounts over the period of 1 year the amount exceeds the lowest per diem rate. In order to avoid exceeding the lower per diem, will you accept 2 separate rates during both periods of time? <br />Answer: The rate shall not exceed the government perdiem rate regardless of month.</p>
<p>Question: Will the US government offer a tax exemption certificate?<br />Answer: A tax exempt certificate is available; however, it is the potential awardee responsibility to ensure it's accepted. Don't believe a tax exempt certificate is relevant for an apartment.</p>
<p>Question: Does the US government pay the security deposit required to rent an apartment?<br />Answer: No</p>
<p>Question: There is no reference to whether the apartment will require cleaning service during occupancy, is cleaning required?<br />Answer: Read the PWS</p>
<p>Question: If cleaning is not a requirement, will the US government pay for carpet cleaning, or damages found when the move-out inspection is performed?<br />Answer: No</p>
<p>Question: If none of the options are exercised, will the US government give the standard apartment notification of 2 months to avoid paying for additional months of an unoccupied apartment?<br />Answer: Read the option clause</p>
