<DESC>Provide major repairs to the central chilled water plant at Davis-Monthan AFB AZ, on as-required basis, for the period 1 October 2007 thru 30 September 2008.  Major repair is defined as all requirements exceeding 10 labor hours or $100.00 in materials costs.  We intend to award this requirement on a sole source basis to Honeywell ACS Service, who currently operates the subject plant under Task Order 5C02 of ESPC contract F04626-98-D0103.  The plant was retrofitted with energy saving equipment as part of the TO, and Honeywell (also as part of the TO) assumed responsibility for operation and routine maintenance of the plant for the life of the TO, or some 15 years.  It will be paid for these services as part of the reimbursement of the overall TO.  For anything exceeding routine maintenance, the SOW for the task order states, "...the Government shall reimburse the Contractor for materials, parts, and supplies in excess of $100 per job.  The Contractor is responsible for the first $100 of each item costing over $100 and 10 labor hours."  The services requested under this solicitation fall under this stipulation, and therefore FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements," applies.  The applicable NAICS Code for this solicitation is 811310.  The Service Contract Act will apply.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/ solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price definitive contract to the offeror who is low priced, technically acceptable. The contractor shall provide service and maintenance of Government-owned DA8 Interferometer and ancillary equipment located at the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW), Bldg. 469-S, Code 49220, PO Box 357058, NAS North Island, San Diego, CA 92135-7058. 

The requirement is for a firm fixed price services contract with a period of performance of one year, plus two option years.  The applicable NAICS code for this action is 811219 and a size standard of $6.5m in revenue.  The proposed contract action is for commercial services and will be negotiated on a full and open competition basis.

This statement identifies necessary services and materials to provide onsite, preventive maintenance of the DA8 Interferometer (S/N IZM33021), and related ancillary equipment, at the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW). The contractor must have full knowledge of the cited equipment, must be able to perform all work in compliance with the original equipment manufacturer?s (OEM) technical specifications, and in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW). Maintenance shall include all travel, accommodations, labor, equipment, and consumable parts. The contractor shall provide the Government with one (1) scheduled preventive maintenance visit, and make all repairs to the extent necessary (as determined either by inspectional testing or disassembly) to ensure a functional system, which efficiently serves its intended purpose. The date and time of service shall be noted in a Trouble Call Log to reflect all maintenance calls, and any exceptions as stipulated therein. Performance completion shall be achieved within 72 hours following the arrival of the field technician. The only exceptions to this requirement will be for extenuating circumstances, which are considered to be beyond the immediate control of maintenance and/ or service personnel, and to be reasonable or prudent within industry standards. Additionally, the contractor shall provide all test equipment, including tools, diagnostic and alignment device, meters, hardware, software, etc., needed to perform the work. The contractor shall coordinate all services requiring on-site visitation by corporate personnel through the Designated Government Representative (DGR), whose name and number will be provided to the contractor upon award. This is the only Government representative, in addition to the buyer, who is authorized to identify on-site maintenance support and/ or place service calls to the contractor?s company. Services are to be performed Monday through Friday (excluding Federal holidays), during the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., local time. In the event that scheduled service or deliveries should fall on a federal holiday (or shutdown period), any outstanding maintenance requirements will be performed on the Government?s next regularly scheduled workday. Following each site visit, the contractor shall provide the Government with a detailed ?Field Service Report? (FSR). The report shall include, but is not limited to: date and time the contractor was notified, date and time the contractor arrived, name of technician, type/ model/ serial number of equipment serviced, time spent on repair, a description of the malfunction, comments as to the cause of the malfunction, a general description of any parts replaced, date and time the system/ equipment was returned to full operational condition, and the time taken to acquire replacement parts (if applicable). The cited report is to be sent via FedEx, or e-mail, to the DGR indicated on the contract award document within 7 days following the completion of services. Should circumstances arise wherein the contractor is confronted with uncertainty related to performance, or have knowledge of a necessity that has not been previously identified within the limitations of this negotiated agreement, the contractor is instructed to immediately contact and advise the DGR of a potential disparity in requirements, which may adversely impact the ability of the contractor to provide requested and/ or required services. In the event of the unavailability of the DGR, wherein modification of this contract may be either be implicated or implied, the contractor shall not undertake any additional actions without receipt of written approval from the Contracting Officer. If circumstances develop wherein the contractor is unable to specify the extent of the repairs needed, the contractor is authorized to take the equipment off-site for repair, with approval from the DGR. The equipment shall be repaired, and returned, within 5 business days. If repairs cannot be completed within the allotted timeframe, it shall become incumbent upon the contractor to notify the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest DGR, in a timely manner, of the new delivery date. The purchase of replacement parts identified during a service visit will necessitate a separate procurement document, which will be initiated through the DGR. In the event such items are requested by the Government, they must meet the original equipment manufacturer?s (OEM) standards, and be of equivalent quality. There shall be no additional service charges, other than those specified herein, regardless of when the service is performed, the time spent by service/ maintenance personnel after arrival at the site (or lodging while awaiting the arrival of additional personnel, equipment, or the delivery of materials and/ or parts), or for transportation to, or from, other sites. Overtime work, or work performed outside of normal business hours, are not included in this order.
