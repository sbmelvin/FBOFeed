<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #11-04-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of an effort under this Master BAA is the development of real-time processing technology to improve the extraction, identification, analysis and reporting of tactical information. The processed information will support the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, protect blue coalition forces with command, control, computer and intelligence applications, and support battlespace awareness for the warfighter.</p>
<p>In the area of ISR information extraction for Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) issues, new and innovative methods and processing techniques will provide decision-makers with ISR information in as near real-time as possible. SIGINT technologies process information on various communications mediums, operate in environments in low signal-to-noise ratio areas and conduct operations against uncooperative targets where the noise types and channel conditions are frequently varying from message to message. As time is critical and ISR mission analysts' workload is high, the automation of the SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation capabilities in both tasking and training is a major goal.</p>
<p>The SIGINT research and development is grouped into three broad technology areas: Information Extraction, Signal Processing and Automation Enhancements. The first, Information Extraction, extracts information from the broadband signal to identify and catalog Signals of Interest (SOI). The second area, Signal Processing, processes the signal to improve signal processor performance for the above information extraction capabilities. This represents research in removing noise and interference in a channel or in multiple channels from signals. The third broad area, Automation Enhancements, uses signal processing techniques to automate the manual techniques that are current practice. This automation may be used to manipulate the SOI for storage and transmission or to synthesize the signal for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 11 - $2M; FY 12 - $6.5M, FY 13 - $9.4M, and FY14 - $7M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $250,000 to 1,000,000 per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.</p>
<p><br />III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS: All potential applicants are eligible. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - A scientific and technical quality assessment of the offeror's approach is to evaluate the development and/or enhancement of real-time SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation technology. White papers/proposals should document the potential quantifiable benefits in terms of increased efficiency of automated data processing, increased capabilities of interactive data processing tools, and increased capabilities to exploit machine-to-machine information. 2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. <br />3) Application and Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and how well it applies to signals intelligence. <br />4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and fees to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel, and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: For classification guidance see section IV paragraph 5. "Classification Guidance for White Paper/Proposal Submissions".</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must have or be able to obtain TS/SCI access to information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>WR-ALC/PKO Infrastructure Support Branch, Robins AFB, GA offers this opportunity to be accomplished using competitive acquisition procedures, 100% set-aside for <strong>Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).</strong> This acquisition is subject to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 238190, size standard $14M. The project consists of all tools, labor, equipment, materials, supplies, transportation and supervision necessary to replace the existing two roller deck sheave (runway sheave) assembly, a part of the existing BAK-12 Aircraft Arresting System, with a new government-furnished three roller deck sheave assembly.(a sheave is a type of pulley wheel). The work requires removal of the existing 2-sheave assembly, followed by careful saw cutting and air hammering of the existing PCC concrete foundation to provide room for resetting the new 3-sheave assembly over the original 2-sheave footprint. Also required is replacement in the original location of the existing 1&frac12;" thick asphalt tape sweep area and sloped aircraft roll over ramp, with a new 8" thick reinforced PCC tape sweep area and sloped aircraft roll over ramp. Installation of 2 sets of new 3-roller deck sheave assemblies, complete with new PCC tape sweep areas and sloped ramps is required, one assembly on each side (east/west) of Robins AFB Runway 33 near the south end, as shown on the Drawings. The rough order of magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. This range does not necessarily reflect the proximity of the actual estimated cost. To be eligible for contract award, prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http:www.ccr.gov/. Contractors must also submit their representations and certifications at the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The United States Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Aberdeen Maryland, 21005 intends to increase the contract ordering ceiling for Contract No. W15P7T-05-D-J101 from $2.5B to $3.069B, to enable additional Delivery Orders/Task Orders (Dos/TOs) to be issued for  ancillary equipment, spare parts, and repair and engineering services for Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINGCARS).<br><br>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source, this action is for the sole source award of a modification to Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101 with ITT Corporation. Due to significant redesigns of SINCGARSs due to obsolescence issue the Government does not possess a complete Technical Data Package to use for competition for the required ancillary items, spare parts and repair and engineering services. Additionally, the technical data for several items of ancillary equipment will only be delivered with limited rights until the 2012-2015 timeframe because these items were developed exclusively at private expense of ITT Corporation. <br><br>W15P7T-05-D-J101 is for production and delivery of substantial quantities of ancillary equipment, spare parts, repair, and engineering services for SINCGARS. The SINCGARS is a family of Very High Frequency-Frequency Modulation frequency hopping and single channel radio systems that provide the primary battalion and below voice and data communications for ground combat forces. The SINCGARS also provides the Internet Controller, which is the digital router for the Army Tactical Internet. It is one of the five major communications/data elements that provide seamless digital communications capabilities to the Modular Force.  The Army has acquired more than 250,000 SINCGARSs in the last three years to meet increased Warfighter requirements associated with the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCOs) and other Army modernization efforts. The proposed action, to increase the ordering ceiling of Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101, is necessary to continue to meet Warfighter requirements for ancillary equipment, spare parts, and repair and engineering services for SINCGARS. The Army has identified a need for significant quantities to support the Army's Modular Force reorganization in addition to on-going efforts in support of OCOs and to complete RESET actions as units return from deployments and their SINCGARSs are prepared for future deployments. <br><br> This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), New England Soldier Support and Individual Equipment (NESSIE) branch has a requirement for the manufacture and delivery of Modular Airborne Weapons Case (MAWC), size small and large. The MAWC, small and large, is needed because of an existing capability gap in the ability to deliver a paratrooper's weapons system and select special items of equipment to the ground during an airborne assault. The integration of advanced weaponry, optics, thermal sights, and lasers into the formation exceeds the current capability. This new capability increases the protection of advanced weapons systems and enhances the paratrooper's ability to safely land and rapidly deploy weapons during both combat and training missions. Both the small and large versions of the Modular Airborne Weapons Case shall provide the paratrooper with a durable, lightweight, and adjustable weapons case allowing for maximum stowage of essential weaponry, optics, and equipment; able to withstand a drop of 27 feet per second to safely deliver the Airborne Soldier's equipment to the ground. The Modular Airborne Weapons Case shall be modular in design allowing for adjustability in both length and width and constructed of low maintenance fabric that is durable and lightweight yet provides critical padding where required for safety. The MAWC must be compatible with current static line personnel parachute systems. The MAWC will be a non-developmental item proposed by the successful Offeror. The NAICS code for this requirement is 314999. This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open basis and will be awarded based upon best value under FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 15. The Government anticipates awarding one contract, however reserves the right to award multiple contracts to meet this requirement. At this time, the anticipated quantities are as follows: between 15,000 - 25,000 small MAWC and between 3,000 - 7,000 large MAWC. An optional ordering quantity for one or both sizes may be included as part of the requirement and resulting solicitation. The Government may include an optional CLIN for the purchase of data rights for Government-use only. Any resultant contract will be on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted ON OR ABOUT 1 JULY 2011 to the Natick Contracting Division web site at https://www3.natick.army.mil, under Business Opportunities, Current Acquisitions, W911QY-11-R-0028. Proposals will be due 30 days after release of the RFP. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation. Only virgin material is to be used in the manufacture of these units. The Berry Amendment will apply. Questions may be addressed by email to mark.marchioli@us.army.mil or faxed to (508) 233-9673.

The contract will be awarded on a lowest price technically compliant basis.<br /><br />The estimated cost of the services and deliverables included within the basic scope of the intended contract is &euro;9,250,000. The reference of the IFB is IFB-CO-13093-VTC. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.<br /><br />NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.<br /><br />The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. For the performance of the contract, however, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A all NATO clearance certifications related to the contract.<br /><br />SUMMARY
<p>This contract will provide IP-based Studio VTC capability to allow the delivery of VTC services to NATO users by the NATO Service Provision Authority.</p>
<p>The project shall be implemented in three stages, consisting of a Proof of Concept Stage of approximately five months in duration, an Implementation and Migration Stage of approximately 13 months in duration, and an In Service Stage of approximately 11 months in duration.</p>
<p>The VTC capability needs to be operational, maintainable, reliable, secure, easy to manage and scalable. It will include the following components:</p>
<p>a. VTC Network Operations Centers (VNOCs): one Main VNOC and one Alternate VNOC<br />b. Sub-VNOC: one Sub-VNOC to be integrated<br />c. VTC Access Nodes (VANs) locations: nine Access Nodes in nine locations (eight locations in Europe and one location in North America)<br />d. HD VTC Terminals: approximately 95 VTC Terminals of various types shall be purchased<br />e. Reference systems: training and troubleshooting<br />f. NATO Secret / NATO Unclassified Cross Domain solution for scheduling</p>
<p>The VTC capability will be centrally managed through the installed VNOC, which will allow the VNOC operators in SHAPE to exercise control of all configuration, operational, and troubleshooting activities required.</p>
<p>A VTC system schedule will allow the users to directly perform the scheduling activities with both Outlook and web-based applications.</p>
<p>The VTC capability will provide distributed services through the VTC Access Node (VAN) installed across the NATO Wide Area Network (WAN). The VANs will enable all videoconferencing services and functions to include gatekeeper, gateway capabilities with other NATO and non-NATO entities, multi-conferencing, and recording.</p>
<p>Some of the existing VTC capability and AV systems will be provided as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE) and will be integrated into the enhanced VTC system to benefit the new services.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for delivering an accredited VTC capability, including all required security accreditation documentation.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for providing complete documentation and training to hand over a system that will be operated and maintained by NATO organizations.<br /><br />BIDDING PROCEDURE<br /><br />Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE)anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about May 23, 2011.
<p>It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101. Based on the results of market research, it is determined that commercial sources are available and capable of satisfying this requirement.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Literacy Information and Communication System, commonly referred to as LINCS, is a dissemination and professional development system, providing information on a wide variety of literacy relevant topics, issues, and resources. It was originally designed (under the former National Institute for Literacy) to provide a centralized point of access to information about adult literacy and an infrastructure to facilitate communication for a highly decentralized field of professionals, volunteers, and learners. The LINCS network included catalogued literacy resources, special collections of materials on topics such as workplace literacy, English as a Second Language, assessment, and a number of online public discussion lists. Each week, current news stories, events, funding opportunities, and professional development opportunities regarding literacy were added to the databases.</p>
<p>LINCS also relied on a group of regional centers, originally called Regional Technology Centers (RTCs) and later called Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) to promote LINCS to the public; develop and manage regional and state-level website infrastructure; help populate the LINCS databases; and provide technical assistance and training at the state and local levels in the use of LINCS for adult education and literacy practitioners.</p>
<p>In 2005, a comprehensive external review found that LINCS "...created an infrastructure capacity for dissemination of tangible materials that contributes to every adult education/literacy professional's own personal database of adult education teaching and learning tool and skills." It also noted that LINCS components "...mark a significant contribution to the adult education and literacy field. They are also classic examples of what economists refer to as a &lsquo;public good. '"</p>
<p>At the time of the review, LINCS components also included what was called the Special Collections and Discussion Lists. The Special Collections were topic based materials that were vetted, but not necessarily research- or evidence-based. Later, this became the Resource Collections which were focused on research based materials that were vetted by at least two external reviewers who were subject matter experts. Discussion Lists were eventually modified to focus more on the content of the Resource Collections rather than solely open-ended discussions.</p>
<p>The U. S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) plans to continue enhancing LINCS to provide high-quality open learning materials to improve teacher effectiveness. A further refinement of LINCS can lead to more effective teachers so that more learners progress to and succeed in postsecondary education. Beginning in FY10, OVAE is supporting a LINCS design of three components: 1) LINCS Regional Professional Development Centers; 2) the Resource Collection; and 3) a technology infrastructure. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is for the LINCS Resource Collection. With this effort, OVAE intends to support nationally significant Adult Education Professional Development activities to enhance the quality of education and literacy nationwide.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR TERMINAL DOPPLER WEATHER RADAR (TDWR) RF FILTER AMPLIFIER (RFFA) SERIAL PRODUCTION
This is a market survey for TERMINAL DOPPLER WEATHER RADAR (TDWR) RF FILTER AMPLIFIER (RFFA) SERIAL PRODUCTION.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing TERMINAL DOPPLER WEATHER RADAR (TDWR) RF FILTER AMPLIFIER (RFFA) SERIAL PRODUCTION.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by 05/18/2011 at 4:00 PM Central Time. Please include the announcement number in your e-mail.    All submittals should be submitted to: Cilony Alejandro, Contract Specialist, at Cilony.Alejandro@faa.gov. If Collect calls will not be accepted.
NOTE:  If you are viewing this announcement from other than the FAA's Contracting Opportunities website, some attachments may not transfer correctly.  You are encouraged to visit the website at faaco.faa.gov.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Seattle, WA has a requirement for a vessel to conduct pre-spawning Sablefish collections off Kodiak, Alaska for the period of September 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. The object of this requirement is to capture a range of sizes of immature and pre-spawning sablefish for gross external ovarian examination and the collection of ovaries for subsequent histological examination of the tissue.</p>
<p><br />To sustain the sablefish population, fishery managers in Alaska set over-fishing limits based, in part, on estimates of the age at which 50% of the females reach sexual maturity converted from a length-at-maturity estimate. This project, updating the sablefish maturity estimates, has been classified as a research priority by these managers, because the currently used estimates of maturity are likely to be inaccurate for several reasons. This project will improve estimates by sampling during the time period when pre-spawning females can be unambiguously distinguished from immature fish.</p>
<p><br />All operations will be conducted out of Kodiak, Alaska for a total of ten (10) days with an option of up to four (4) more days during the performance period November-December 2011. The preferred period is during December (excluding the dates December 25 or 26).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall supply the vessel, captain, crew, water, food (3 nutritionally balanced meals per day), and berthing for up to 2 scientists for the length of the charter period.</p>
<p>The vessel shall have been actively used for commercial trawling or research where trawl gear was used in the past 12 months prior to charter operations. Vessel must be completely rigged for bottom trawling operations for catching sablefish, including a net, roller gear, main wire, trawl winches, trawl net accessories, vessel GPS navigation, and vessel acoustic depth sounder. Vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of 7 knots. Berthing spaces including clean mattresses with fitted covers for two scientists, which may include both males and females, is required.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees. Any vendor desiring to be considered for award must be registered in CCR and ORCA using this NAICS code. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract. Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about Thursday, May 19, 2011 at http://www.fbo.gov/. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [Add To Watchlist] and [Add Me To Interested Vendors] features which provide a notification when the RFP becomes available for download as well as all postings of information associated with this solicitation, thereafter. Each potential proposer is responsible for checking the FedBizOpps website to gain all current information related to the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Should some or all of this additional funding not be allotted to the lease, SRNS would intend to reserve the unilateral right to terminate the lease for convenience.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):<br />Protected Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM): Augmentation and Next Generation
<p>To be Posted: 11 May 2011 Response Date: 26 Jun 2011<br />Fedbizops Reference: 11-52</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Description<br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Directorate seeks industry feedback on capabilities and approaches to meet future strategic and protected tactical MILSATCOM needs to increase efficiency and affordability in the 2020-2035 timeframe. More specifically, information is sought on existing technical capabilities, recommended acquisition strategies, and relevant future technologies that reduce risk, cost, complexity, and/or development timelines. The information may encompass alternative protected MILSATCOM architectures (which span space, ground, and terminal segments), hosted payloads, small freeflyers, operational management, and modified or new waveform/protocols. A small freelyer is defined as a small stand alone satellite that is launched on a Falcon-9 launch vehicle.</p>
<p>Protected MILSATCOM is defined as Extremely High Frequency services to both strategic and tactical forces. Protected strategic MILSATCOM must be able to provide low probability of interception/detection/exploitation (LPI/LPD/LPE), survivable, anti-scintillation, and anti-jam communications as well as nuclear command and control services in all operational environments - nuclear, contested, and benign. Protected tactical MILSATCOM must be able to provide anti-jam and LPI/LPD/LPE communications in both contested and benign operational environments.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in obtaining information and recommendations of new systems achieving reductions in cost of protected communications, and the efficient application of future protected MILSATCOM for the strategic and/or protected tactical missions. Affordability must take into account insertion of new technologies to reduce cost, enterprise (space, terminal, ground, control) improvements in manufacturing and production capability and a closer examination of cost driving requirements. Capabilities of a new system(s) must take into account emerging threats, resiliency, information assurance for a wide variety of users, capacity and coverage demands, operational management, terminal segment synchronization, integration with current/future service networks, enterprise life cycle costs, development timelines, acquisition strategies, and risk. These factors may influence recommendations on the overall architecture as well as specific features such as (but not limited to) the orbit(s), constellation size(s), degree of backwards compatibility to the Extended Data Rate waveform, information assurance architecture, cost/complexity per satellite, cost/complexity per terminal, and cost/complexity of the ground segment.</p>
<p>All inquiries pertaining to this RFI shall be made to each of the points of contact (POCs) within this RFI.</p>
<p>Government/Industry Exchange <br />The Government anticipates conducting classified SECRET/NOFORN Industry Day and one-on-one interchange meetings at Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA on 25 and 26 May. Attendance at these meetings, should they occur, is restricted to those attendees with appropriate and verifiable security clearances. Sources interested in attending must submit an email to the POCs referenced below no later than seven days after this RFI is posted. Interested parties not pre-cleared to attend Industry Day at the classified SECRET/NOFORN level will not be permitted entrance. Further details regarding these meetings will be provided to those interested parties cleared for attendance. The Government will not provide any reimbursement for Industry Day attendance.</p>

Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410. The small business size standard is $15 Million.</p>
<p>Information submitted in response to this RFI will enhance the Government's ability to acquire quality systems in the future and, therefore, will be used for planning purposes only. All material provided in response to this RFI shall be unclassified, non-confidential, and non-proprietary to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>Interested sources providing confidential/proprietary information in response to this RFI shall separately and clearly identify and mark all confidential/proprietary information. The Government will take all necessary steps to protect/safeguard any confidential/proprietary information provided. The Government will NOT be responsible for any confidential/proprietary information not clearly marked.</p>

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of the government's intent to add 300 hours to an existing contract for the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic an analytical support to the Billfish and Bluefin Tuna Research program of the Southeast Fisheries Science Center to Envisoft Cd Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries (NMFS), Miami, FL for consulting, LLC in Key Biscayne, FL. <br />The contractor will continue to provide support relative to analyses of data derived from electronic pop-up satellite archival tag data and analysis of oceanographic features associated with the movement data derived from these electronic tags.
<p>Interested contractors must have intimate knowledge and vast experience in these research areas, as reflected in peer review publication record, in order to successfully accomplish this work. These research topics are specialized, previous experience is required for collaborating with SEFSC billfish research team on research design and analysis of data derived there from, and the analysis of electronic popup satellite archival tag data, including the design of software to display tag results.</p>
<p>The contractor shall participate in manuscript preparation (and associated analyses) for technical papers in FY 11. The primary focus is to provide input for papers dealing with the effects of ocean scale hypoxia of Atlantic istiophorid billfishes, possibly including standardization of catch rates for Atlantic billfish. In the future it may include efforts to incorporate impacts of hypoxia based habitat compression into the stock assessment process. Additional analyses of electronic data may include papers dealing with Vertical habitat use of bluefin and yellowfin tuna, istiophorid billfish; and swordfish in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific derived from pop-up satellite archival tag data, the development of white marlin movement corridors from popup satellite archival data, and other topics as needed:</p>
<p>Project Deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Provide analyses and assistance in the preparation of technical manuscripts for the Billfish research program of SEFSC;<br />2. Perform statistical and other analyses of longline and electronic tag data required to advance SEFSC billfish research goals and to publish the results;<br />3. Integrate analytical results with environmental data and other information concerning national and international fisheries that target billfish or that catch them incidental in fisheries directed at other species; <br />4. Provide SEFSC with documentation of research results suitable to be readily incorporated into manuscripts to be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals;<br />5. There will be progress meetings between the parties at mutually agreed intervals and venues;<br />6. This research shall be completed by December 31, 2011.</p>

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B.

<DESC>This RFI seeks to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential solutions to the problem of converting legacy documents to XML format. The Office is exploring a wide range of possible solutions for several different but related needs.
<p>The aim of this market research is to find solutions for this project at different stages. (1) initial processing with ad hoc collections with a very short time frame to make a September 2011 deadline to convert about 5,000 documents, (2) a path towards a fully automated system for converting legacy online documents into fully structured textual format, to begin approximately Sept 2011 and continue for approximately two years, and (3) when the new end-to-end system becomes operational, the intention will be for most information to enter the system as structured text or as text-backed documents, but there will continue to be a need for scanning and conversion of certain documents, so a solution that can accommodate this work going forward is also sought.</p>

<SOLNBR>HSTS04-11-RFI-CT2068
<RESPDATE>060111
<CONTACT>Holly H Bolger, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-227-3036, Email holly.bolger@dhs.gov
<DESC>Subject: Request for Information (RFI) to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security Technology, Passenger Screening Program - Passenger Screening X-ray Technology, Low Density Threshold Analysis.
<p><br />1. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background: TSA is responsible for protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. However, several challenges exist relating to optimizing checkpoint performance. Passenger screening at the checkpoint relies heavily on the Transportation Security Officer's (TSO) interpretation of Passenger Screening X-ray Technology, which can be complex and difficult to interpret. The amount of time spent on this interpretation can factor heavily on overall passenger throughput at the checkpoint. Additionally, screening costs are continuously rising with every new piece of equipment introduced to the checkpoint. TSA believes there may be a security and operational benefit to automatically clearing bags that have a very low probability of containing a threat.</p>
<p>Objective: TSA is currently conducting market research to determine if products currently exist to automatically and efficiently clear low density/low threat items through the passenger screening x-ray technology located at the airport passenger screening checkpoint. TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that addresses the following concepts: <br />&bull; Provides an automated detection algorithm that will reduce the amount of review time required by a screener and increase accuracy</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluates the impact on the required number of TSOs to perform image interpretation and bag searches</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluates the types of threats that could be automatically cleared and those that must be manually reviewed</p>
<p>&bull; Be mindful of space constraints within the common checkpoint environment and potential for changes to layout or procedures</p>
<p>&bull; Identifies hardware/software for identification of data</p>
<p>TSA's objective is to identify a solution that will apply detection algorithms to reliably clear items that do not pose a threat to the aviation transit system. By doing so, higher detection rates will be achieved and passenger's item throughput will be improved. Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain: <br />(1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, <br />(2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a complete solution that meets the above concept(s), and, <br />(3) suggestions on alternative approaches to increase detection of threats and/or increase throughput.</p>

Work will include redesign and renovation of six barracks to house one soldier per room; replacement of all water and sewer lines within the block; conversion of the CEP from a traditional 4-pipe boiler/chiller system to a water source heat pump system with a ground coupled well field; replacement of hot and chilled distribution piping within the 39000 block with condenser loop and hot water distribution piping; solar domestic hot water heating at each barracks; renovation of the laundry building; addition of mechanical room space and mechanical equipment at six admin facilities and the dining facility in the 39000 block for compatibility with the new CEP; temporary boilers and chillers for the six admin facilities, dining facility, and six previously renovated barracks that will be occupied during construction; sidewalk replacements; parking lot reconfiguration and reconstruction; landscaping; and LEED Silver certification for each barracks.<br><br>Range of Magnitude:  $50 to $100 Million.<br><br>Period of Performance:   720 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>  a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>  b. The complexity of the project.<br>  c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>  d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>  e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br>  f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>  g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>  h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>  a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>  b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br><br>     1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br><br>    2. Be consistent with law.<br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>  a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>  b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>  c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>  d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>  e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br><br>  f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br><br>  g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>  h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?<br><br>  i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?<br><br>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Richard D.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS only.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified Contractors to include Small Businesses, 8(a), HUBZone Certified and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 813920, Professional Organizations.  The Small Business Size Standard is $7 Million.  <br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has identified a requirement to conduct capability assessments of all districts, divisions, and headquarters to provide a baseline against which improvement efforts and the success of investments will be measured.  The USACE is requesting the standards and assessment components of the Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) be used for this purpose.     <br>The Statement of Work follows:<br><br>Background/Statement of Need<br>In 2003, Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) began a successful effort on behalf of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assess state programs against a comprehensive, collaborately-developed standard. The resulting EMAP Standard, although not easy to achieve, has received tremendous support from states and the federal government as the standards represented program goals that government stakeholders agreed to aspire to achieve. The subsequent EMAP baseline assessments of states gave a snapshot for states to gauge their preparedness capabilities against the set standards. <br>EMAP is a voluntary assessment and accreditation process for government emergency management programs, based on documentation and verification of compliance with collaboratively developed national standards. The EMAP process includes self-assessment, on-site assessment and findings by a team of trained and experienced emergency managers resulting in an assessment report detailing findings. EMAP is a non-profit organization headquartered in Lexington, KY. EMAP is an affiliate organization of The Council of State Governments. <br>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has identified a requirement to conduct capability assessments of all districts, divisions, and headquarters to provide a baseline against which improvement efforts and the success of investments will be measured. USACE has requested that the standards and assessment components of EMAP be used for this purpose. <br><br>Proposed Statement of Work <br>There is a need for comprehensive assessment program that is based on existing Emergency Management Standard and assessment processes and assesses all levels of emergency management within the USACE. EMAP would conduct assessments of all districts, divisions and headquarters (n=38) to serve as a baseline capability assessment of each program as a foundation for structuring and monitoring improvement efforts over the next several years. The assessments would employ the subscription, application, self-assessment, on-site assessment, assessment report and Program Review Committee steps of the EMAP process and Commission decision on accreditation if a program chooses to pursue. In addition, each assessment report would be provided to USACE headquarters to track progress over time with compliance. <br><br>Proposed Scope of Work <br>  Regional Workshops <br><br>EMAP recognizes that training and education are keys to success in building emergency management programs. EMAP proposes to provide assessor training and accreditation manager orientation to USACE personnel to increase the assessor cadre to manage the on-site assessments and instruct personnel regarding the roles and responsibilities of accreditation managers and the EMAP process. EMAP will hold these trainings as regional workshops completely four (n=4) in year one and then an additional two (n=2) each following year.2 <br><br>  Capability Assessment Program <br><br>EMAP will capture assessment data for future analysis and reporting and will provide detailed assessment and analysis reports to USACE headquarters at the end of each year of the agreement. Each program will receive an assessment report for consideration of potential accreditation effort.   The total number of programs equate to 38 with the reports to be delivered at the end of each year during the life of the contract, i.,e, if 8 USACE EM programs are evaluated during year, then 8 separate reports and analysis will be delivered by the end of the that program year. <br><br>  Governance and Administration <br><br>EMAP is governed by a ten (10)-member Board of Directors, of which members are appointed by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) and the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). The following are the current requirements for the administrative and governance structure of EMAP: <br>  Program Advisory Workgroup: The Program Advisory Workgroup is the implementation and support team composed of USACE and EMAP key personnel. The Workgroup will provide clear definition of all EMAP standards as it pertains to the project and will develop specific guidelines and resources for assessing each standard by programs and assessors. The Workgroup will also provide guidance on particular training guidelines as it relates to the standards and assessment methodology of the programs. The Workgroup will meet four (n=4) times a year and periodically throughout the year virtually. <br><br>  EMAP Program Review Committee: The Program Review Committee is responsible for considering programs being presented for accreditation, using assessment reports prepared by the assessor teams, and making recommendations regarding accreditation status. The committee meets three (3) times a year. Funding would be utilized to support a portion of the committee. <br><br>  EMAP Administration: Funding would be utilized to support a portion of 1.15 Full Time Employees. EMAP staff positions have been funded in the past through grants from FEMA and other organizations. With the additional work items, EMAP would maintain the current Executive Director and Projects Coordinator and will devote a full time Projects Assistant to the USACE project. These positions will be critical to the development of the training curriculum and programs, administration of the Program Advisory Workgroup activities, assessment activities and reporting and committee staffing. <br><br>Deliverables <br>  Access to the EMAP Online Assessment Tool linking national priorities, policies, and grant guidance documents for all divisions, districts and headquarters. <br>  Baseline assessment data for divisions, districts and headquarters- year one (n=4)   The first year would provide for a baseline assessment of HQUSACE, 1 Division, and 2 Districts.<br>  Roll-up assessment data and report for headquarters usage. <br>  Alignment of all emergency management programs under one set of standards. <br>  Establishment of subject matter expertise cadre within USACE  during the base year that will include a cadre of 4-6 USACE personnel that will be trained and available to assist in assessments. <br>  Enhanced and increased training programs based on standards. <br>  EMAP participation in briefings and training workshops. <br>  EMAP resource materials for key stakeholders.<br>  Full time robust EMAP administration and governance dedicated to the program including the Program Advisory Workgroup. <br><br>Program Performance Period <br>A 5 year contract is anticipated including the Base Year and four (4) one year options. <br><br><br>EMAP Program Contact <br>Nicole Ishmael, EMAP Executive Director <br>Emergency Management Accreditation Program <br>PO Box 11910 <br>Lexington, KY 40578 <br>(859) 244-8242, Fax (859) 244-8239 <br>nishmael@csg.org<br> <br>

Relevant facility information that is available will be provided when the RFQ is issued. 

The offeror shall provide all data and analysis, design services and support services for obtaining required permits, training, labor materials, tools, equipment and supervision to accomplish this project.

Contractor shall utilize green building materials where applicable.  The project should meet VA design standards which can be found at (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/spec.asp) where applicable.

Because this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center (VA-NEBC) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement to design and install a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system at the Jack C Montgomery VA Medical Center located in Muskogee, Oklahoma. 
	
The VA is seeking a "Turn-Key" procurement, which will involve all work including but not limited to all necessary devices and connections between the inverter and main electrical service and all connectors necessary for complete "Turn Key" operation.

The VA will not accept any offers that disclaim parts of the required work to make the unit complete and ready for use. 

Relevant facility information that is available will be provided when the RFQ is issued. 

The offeror shall provide all data and analysis, design services and support services for obtaining required permits, training, labor materials, tools, equipment and supervision to accomplish this project. The design and installation of this project is expected to be between 210 and 365 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.

The system is expected to operate on the customer side of the meter, but allow for possible exporting of power to the electric utility with net metering.  Contractor shall utilize green building materials where applicable.  The project should meet VA design standards which can be found at (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/spec.asp) where applicable.

Because this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

<DESC>Ft. Eustis is located between Newport News and Williamsburg, Virginia.  It encompasses approximately 7,868 acres of land, and water ways. The US Army has a number of large variety of increasing missions and operations at Ft. Eustis including the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Headquarters. The increasing mission requirements have resulted in a parallel increased need for the use of cellular devices, including voice communication and data transmission.  Throughout Ft. Eustis, including inside of buildings, cellular phones are unable to transmit to a nearby cell site, base station or repeater, commonly referred to as "Dead Zones". The need for stable and consistent cellular signal strength on Ft. Eustis is essential in meeting National Defense and Department of Defense missions.  Request industry to provide information on "how to best" provide consistent cellular signal strength throughout Ft Eustis, including inside buildings. Eustis building structures are constructed of wood, metal, and/or brick.  The cellular signal must be of 3rd generation mobile telecommunications standards and 4th generation of cellular wireless standards with data transmission.  At a minimum, Ft. Eustis should not experience less than a 70% signal coverage capability both in open areas, as well as, within building structures.  All cellular signals must be within the licensed frequency ranged as authorized by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).  This is not a solicitation for a contract.

<DESC>DARPA is seeking ideas for an organization, business model and approach appropriate for a self-sustaining investment vehicle in support of the 100 Year Starship<sup>TM</sup> Study. The 100 Year Starship<sup>TM</sup> Study is a project seeded by DARPA to develop a viable and sustainable model for persistent, long-term, private-sector investment into the myriad of disciplines needed to make long-distance space travel practicable and feasible. The genesis of this study is to foster a rebirth of a sense of wonder among students, academia, industry, researchers and the general population to consider "why not" and to encourage them to tackle whole new classes of research and development related to all the issues surrounding long duration, long distance spaceflight. DARPA contends that the useful, unanticipated consequences of such research will have benefit to the Department of Defense and to NASA, and well as the private and commercial sector. The information obtained will be used for planning and acquisition strategy development. DARPA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution basis. Providing data and information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and the inclusion of such restricted/limited data/information is discouraged. Responses as a single file in Adobe PDF electronic format can be submitted to 100YSS@darpa.mil by 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Time, Friday, June 3, 2011. For complete details of this notice, please refer to the attachment, "RFI - 100 Year Starship Study".

<p>The Objective of this RFI is to seek broad stakeholder input and interest on the application of VDA system within the transportation community, identify potential impacts and benefits of using the VDA system, and gather information on tried, existing, and potential VDA system operations strategies. The information will assist the USDOT in identifying some of the barriers to deploying VDA systems, and will support the development of a VDA project. The USDOT may select various innovative and pioneering VDA operations strategies for further study. Moreover, entities (public agencies, private sector companies, and other organizations) associated with the selected VDA operations strategies may be asked to provide continued stakeholder input in the development of the VDA project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>Transportation data varies extensively across agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, regional planners and operations managers often lack readily accessible, shared, and well-documented data upon which to make decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result and with each problem being addressed, these planners and managers must perform translations (often with dubious reliability) on an ad hoc basis within a limited time and at additional cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The process is extremely inefficient and the quality of decisions is potentially compromised. For example, multiple agencies within a region operate separately and maintain their own transportation facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each has different goals and objectives, different responsibilities, capabilities and operational needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, each may be collecting data, archiving it, and/or using it in real-time for different purposes and in different formats to meet their own local requirements and not the broader community or regional needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of these systems usually provides data at different levels of detail and do not communicate with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, the state of the practice of planning and operations management lacks efficiencies and qualities that can readily be addressed by new tools and methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project would address the current lack of accessible, shared, and well-documented data by improving efficiencies <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>in: 1) analyzing decisions in a more cohesive manner across entire regions; 2) understanding travel demand patterns across entire regions with jurisdictions interacting with each other; 3) determining performance measures for better performance management on entire regions; 4) validating regional travel demand models for robust analyses; 5) integrating analysis and modeling tools to better determine influence that operational strategies have on traveler behavior and decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data that is usually stored and hosted by its original owners would be selected and accessed by users through the use of web technologies such as virtual warehousing and data fusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through metadata and other data documentation methods, these data will be automatically redefined, cleansed and translated so as to make them usable and understandable to the broader transportation community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These technical capabilities would be supported by data sharing agreements and data documentation specifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By providing the broader transportation community with access to increasingly more data sources in a more usable fashion and covering regional transportation systems would enable: 1) more advanced and integrated analyses of the performance of those systems resulting in better decision making across entire regions; 2) real-time operators to be making more informed decisions, and provide better traffic control and traveler guidance, thus avoiding delays and congestion; 3) correlations and trends among events from several existing transportation systems to be available and used to improve operations; 4) decision support systems to be built on the knowledge gained from several transportation systems to improve operations.; 5) Origin-Destination O-D data that currently is questionable to be more easily validated; 6) operational tools to be integrated and used with planning tools thus advancing planning for operations and mainstreaming operations in the planning process.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Physik Instrumente (PI) of Auburn, Massachusetts, for the purchase of a XY and Z Scanner System to be used by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland <br />***NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or <br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C.2304(d)(1)(B) or U.S.C.253(d)(1)(B).<br />***** Sole source determination is based on the need for an XY and Z Scanner System<br />(see below for the minimum specifications). This XY and Z scanner system will be the core of a NIST custom built, high speed atomic force microscope. <br />NIST currently owns a nanopositioning stage with control electronics from PI for a similar instrument without the thermal characterization feature. Since NIST requires standardization measurements, it is crucial that there be multiple identical instruments on hand should a failure of at least one part occurs. PI has developed a proprietary software library for commanding the motion of their nanopositioning stages, called the General Command Set (GCS). The scanning software and technology transfer must be interchangeable with the existing system. PI is the only known vendor capable in providing the required XY and Z Scanner System.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCAD) is requesting information pertaining to an electro-optical self test that would verify performance of the Third Generation Electro-Optical Console (EO3), (P/N: 2054AS400-2001) at the collimator aperture based on specification and/or TPS requirements. The Electro-Optic Third Generation (EO3) is a component of the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS). <br />The EO3 provides specialized capability for executing F-18 Advanced Tactical Forward Looking Infra-Red (ATFLIR) and SH60 FLIR Test Program Sets (TPSs). The cost of maintaining the EO3 is driven by asset removals. Periodic calibrations account for 38% of the removals. Could Not Duplicates (CNDs) account for 17% and Failures account for 45% of the removals. The Integrated Photonics Assembly (IPA) is the overwhelming majority of EO3 asset removals driven by a 12 month calibration cycle and high failure and CND rate. Results of preliminary analysis revealed the possibility of performing field calibrations, extending the calibration intervals by selective field calibrations, and moving to an electro-optical self test event driven calibration approach. The event driven calibration approach would replace the current calendar driven approach. The electro-optical self test may potentially verify performance of the EO3 console at the collimator aperture based on TPS requirements rather than the EO3 performance specification. <br />Respondents are asked to review the current EO3 requirements within the CASS B1 Prime Item Development Specification, ATFLIR TPS Test Strategy Report (TSR), and SH-60 FLIR TPS TSR to determine the actual EO3 requirements that should be verified to ensure unit-under-test (UUT) performance. Technical data, including the Performance Specification, directly related to the requirements of this RFI will be made available on CD-ROM disk to offerors intending to respond; however, some of the data is company proprietary and respondents must negotiate a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) directly with the company prior to receiving the disk. Respondents must first request the data from the Government, (which will be provided via traceable shipment of the CD-ROM disk upon confirmation that all documentation required for release has been provided). All requests for data must be in writing and must contain a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800) 352-3572 or at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp. The certified DD Form 2345 and your written request may be sent to the persons listed below via mail, email, or fax:<br />Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division<br />Code 25213, Bldg 562-2, Room 306<br />Highway 547<br />Lakehurst NJ 08733-5082<br /><br />Dianne Mount Allen Bresley<br />732-323-2903 Desk 732-323-4068 Desk<br />732-323-7440 Fax 732-323-2359 Fax<br />Dianne.Mount@navy.mil Allen.bresley@navy.mil
<p>The request for data and certified copy of the DD2345 should be submitted to Ms. Dianne Mount who will then provide the contact information to execute the non-disclosure agreement (also referred to as a proprietary information agreement (PIA)) discussed above. The company owning the data rights to proprietary data will notify the Navy points-of-contact that said NDA has been executed and at that time, the Navy will provide the data to the respondent.<br />Distribution to team members or sub-contractors of such data shall be the responsibility of the organization that was granted access and shall be limited to a "need to know" basis. All guidance contained herein with regard to handling, distribution, and destruction of the data shall be flowed down to all team members, partners, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors having access to the data. Those who take receipt of any portion or all of the data shall comply with all laws, export controls, provisions contained within the NDA and distribution statements associated with the data contained on the CD-ROM disk.<br />Requests for additional information not contained in the CD-ROM disk may be made to persons listed above.

<DESC>Sole source for Cedarville Associates, LLC for urban soil taxonomy
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC,  in order to assist the EPA in Urban Soils Survey and Hydrologic Characterization Work for Sustainable Use of Vacant Land.  Post-industrial cities share the problems of ageing civic and water infrastructure, a depleted tax base and underserved populations lacking in basic environmental services and opportunity. On the other hand, these same urban core areas possess significant natural resource capitals in terms of what are presently unmanaged vacant lots, riparian areas, and culverted stream systems. Due to the expense of legal actions against large cities for violations of the Clean Water Act (1972) for combined sewer overflows, governmental authorities have started to look for ways of managing storm flows without resorting to traditional, capital-intensive wastew ater infrastructure. One option to decrease the storm flow quantity is to use vacant land and its soil pore space for detention of excess storm water runoff volume.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC, in order to assist the EPA in Urban Soils Survey and Hydrologic Characterization Work for Sustainable Use of Vacant Land. Post-industrial cities share the problems of ageing civic and water infrastructure, a depleted tax base and underserved populations lacking in basic environmental services and opportunity. On the other hand, these same urban core areas possess significant natural resource capitals in terms of what are presently unmanaged vacant lots, riparian areas, and culverted stream systems. Due to the expense of legal actions against large cities for violations of the Clean Water Act (1972) for combined sewer overflows, governmental authorities have started to look for ways of managing storm flows without resorting to traditional, capital-intensive wastewater infrastructure. One option to decrease the storm flow quantity is to use vacant land and its soil pore space for detention of excess storm water runoff volume.
<p>Soil investigations will be conducted on a selection of vacant lot areas to develop a representative soil map that accounts for major sources of variability in soil formation, horizonation, excavation and land-grading associated with construction and demolition activities, among other attributes. This updated, detailed soil sampling and mapping will inform environmental managers on the potential for soil management and how to best utilize soil resources in adding detention capacity to the various ("sewershed") drainage areas, quantify variation in infiltration capacity, and establish soil capabilities and limitations in the context of this overall effort.<br />A. LOGISTICS AND TASKS:</p>
<p>1. Since site selection and overall quality of the sampling process will benefit from the presence of the contractor, we specify that the contractor shall be present in the field during two periods. The first period will occur in the month of July and the second period will occur in August, or September. The first period would be arranged for mid-July 2011 in Cleveland OH; and August or early September 2011 in Cincinnati OH.</p>
<p>2. USEPA will take nominal 2 inch diameter by 4 feet depth (to 12' or refusal) soil cores. The cores will be left in the acetate core sleeves.</p>
<p>3. Over the course of spring/summer 2011, USEPA will take nominal 2" diameter by 4' (length, serially taken to up to 12' total depth) soil cores at up to 30 sites in Cincinnati OH, and from 15 to 30 sites in Cleveland OH, totaling not more than 150 individual (4') core sections, though other core sections may be kept for reference and for the sake of comparison. The vendor shall be present at the time of sampling, and will retain the soil cores for taxonomic descriptions, and basic soil chemical analyses. All sampling gear and consumables will be provided by USEPA. The contractor will arrange for transport or shipment of soil sub-samples to a soil characterization laboratory</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall take photos of each site to record prominent features and general landscape condition, then georeference each sampling point with a suitable GPS unit that has good resolution (~3m)</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall conduct descriptions of up to 150 soil cores (total 4' core sections) as per details in the next section, which covers specific approach and QA/QC; and subsample for chemical characterization horizons of each soil core as determined and agreed upon by USEPA and the contractor. For example, the surface horizon and a unique or impeding sub-surface horizon may be of greatest interest to USEPA, and therefore, there would be two samples per core.<br />B. DETAILS:<br />Soil Description<br />A complete pedon description of each component identified in the study area shall be written by the Contractor and the taxonomy of the soil core (nominal pedons, pedons hereon) shall be detailed and, if possible or suggested, related to a well-defined, existing soil type. <br /><br />Where possible, the number of pedons that are sub-sampled for chemical analysis shall be based on similarities in soil composition and arrangement of diagnostic horizons among the soil cores. Samples shall also be subject to lab analyses including (grinding-sieving, pH, organic carbon determination, particle size analysis, exchangeable base determination, and titratable acidity). Laboratory analysis shall be performed by a suitable, certified soil characterization laboratory. USEPA shall inspect and at their option approve laboratory analysis protocols as written and held by the contractor's laboratory.</p>
<p>Soil survey standards from the National Soil Survey Handbook [Section 627.08(d)(2)] and the Soil Survey Manual shall be followed. Quality assurance protocol shall be carried out by the contractor.</p>
<p>C. DEVELOPMENT OF MAP:</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop a soil map for sampling areas in each of Cincinnati and Cleveland OH project sites. To the extent possible, all map units shall be consociations with a single component representing a homogeneous unit, except for asphalt, concrete, buildings, or other manmade (impervious) surfaces included in the delineations. A series name shall be used to identify the component wherever possible. Where a series name cannot be used, a soil family shall be used to identify the component. One site shall be selected from each map unit identified, to typify soil characteristics of that map unit and to serve as a basis for soil classification based on Keys to Taxonomy (11th edition).</p>
<p>If data support is appropriate, map units shall be labeled with a combination of two digit numeric symbol representing the taxonomic unit followed by an alphabetic character representing slope. If other phases are needed, they shall be designated by a numeric symbol following the slope phase. Special feature symbols shall be used, if needed and will represent point features. The map shall be digitized; all sample locations and transect points shall be georeferenced using GPS at the time of sampling. A legend of map symbols and map unit names along with a conversion table (that will provide greater detail (order-1 resolution) by giving a taxonomy to soils presently designated as urban land complex) based on map units currently identified by NRCS in the Soil Survey of Cuyahoga County, laboratory data, and pedon descriptions shall be provided. In addition, a populated attribute database shall be developed and tables shall be generated.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>1. Evaluation Method</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a single purchase order to the responsible offeror whose quote represents the best overall value to the government based on (1) technical and previous experience, (2) past performance, and (3) quality assurance plan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.</p>
<p>(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Vaginal Specula, Disposable. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong> The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe </strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted , i.e., Cardinal Health, and/or Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its website at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is Aug 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Vaginal Specula-Disposable. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement $1,166,991. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North: $292,561; MMESO South: $270,335; MMESO West: $311,431; MMESO Europe: $204,598; and MMESO Pacific: $88,046. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top sixty two (62) line items of the total seventy four (74) line items, account for 97.8% ($1,142,450) of the total volume in sales ($1,166,991) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 8 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered and all supporting documentation provided with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Vaginal Specula-Disposable products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for optically clear acrylic or molded plastic, latex free, have a light source capable handle that is ergonomically designed and can protect the light source from contamination either in the design of the handle or by a sheath as follows:<br />a. <br />Vaginal Speculum Premium Medium Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Premium Small Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum with Sheath, Premium Medium Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Premium Large Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Disposable Sheath<br />Deluxe Vaginal Speculum with Sheath Small Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Medium Graves Economy Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Economy Small Disposable<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Vaginal Specula, Disposable</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. <br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Vaginal Specula, Disposable product line. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal.<br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor for Vaginal Specula, Disposable or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. <br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />(Note: vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative). Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs. Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />1. Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span> Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of 25 of each size and type listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />Vaginal Speculum Premium Small Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum Premium Medium Disposable<br />Vaginal Speculum with Sheath, Premium Medium Disposable</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection for each MMESO AOR will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The Vaginal Speculum is optically clear and free of sharp edges. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.01.01; ECRI Institute Health Devices; ISO 13485:2003 Medical devices).<br />2. The Vaginal Speculum resists bending, breaking and cracking. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.01.01; ECRI Institute Health Devices; ISO 13485:2003 Medical devices).<br />3. The Vaginal Speculum stays firmly locked in place. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.01.01; ECRI Institute Health Devices; ISO 13485:2003 Medical devices).<br />4. The Vaginal Speculum is easy to handle and prepare for insertion. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.01.01; ECRI Institute Health Devices)<br />5. The speculum handle will easily and securely accommodate a light source. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO area of responsibility (AOR) based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the vendor's anticipated post-standardization costs. Post-standardization cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of each MMESO. Unmatched items will be represented in the post-standardization cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price (post-standardization cost) will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Nasopharyngeal Airways. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong></p>
<p><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airways. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,855,661.91. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data 15 clustered line items of the total 115 line items, account for 99.25% ($1,841,758.94) of the total volume in sales ($1,855,661.91) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 15 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide <strong>an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. <br />A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each MTF will evaluate the Nasopharyngeal Airways products with the below listed requirements. Each MTF will provide a minimum of two evaluations per vendor in a clinical/patient setting.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 12 MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Airway size is easy to identify. The evaluator will hold the airway between thumb and forefinger and will be immediately able to visualize the size on the product and/or packaging.<br />2. Airway has smooth rounded edges. The airway should have smooth rounded edges and be soft and flexible to reduce risk of tissue damage to patient. <br />3. Airway facilitates oralpharyngeal suctioning. The evaluator will observe the critical function of suctioning for patient airway maintenance.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00 PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program.   *This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.  GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.   Questions regarding postponement: GSA Contact: Alan Rosner, 212-264-0868 E-mail: smartshop@gsa.gov  The refreshed Solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule 75, Office Products / Supplies and Services and New Products Technology will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website on the Internet at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov on February 18, 2011.

Solicitation 2FYB-BU-050001-B is a Worldwide Federal Supply Schedule. The offering of office products/supplies and services listed in the firms commercial office supply catalog are acceptable. Offerors may offer their entire commercial catalog, or may offer a select, limited line of office products.

Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a performance period of 5 years with options to renew for up to 3 additional 5-year periods.

The aggregate must conform to the following specifications:  
SPECIFICATIONS:	
Cover material shall meet the requirements of the following table of gradations as determined by Montana Specification MT-70 1, Table 701-12, Grade 4A.
Aggregate Gradation Table:
Sieve Size              Percent Passing by Weight
    3/8"	                               100%   No. 4	                               15% or less   No. 8	                                   --  No. 200	                               2% or less
1.  The material for Grade 4A must be non-plastic.
2.  The composite aggregate must not have adherent films of clay, vegetable matter, frozen lumps, or other extraneous matter that prevents thorough coating with bituminous material. Bituminous material must remain adhered to the material upon contact with water.  No combination of shale, clay, coal, or soft particles shall exceed 1.5 percent.
3.  The material shall have a wear not to exceed 30 percent at 500 revolutions.
4.  A minimum of 70 percent by weight of the coarse aggregate for Grade 4A must have at least one fractured face.
5.  All contractors shall supply documentation of gradation test results to NPS along with their quote.
MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT: The contractor (and NPS trucks) shall obtain weigh tickets from state certified scales for each delivery made.  Payment will be made on actual quantities received and accepted.
TESTING:  The successful contractor shall provide material samples to the government for evaluation upon award; delivery shall not commence until the government confirms the sample material conforms to the specifications..
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT:  The control of noxious weeds shall be achieved through a weed management plan.  All parties submitting quotes must have a source of material that has a current weed management plan that has been approved by the local county weed board and Yellowstone National Park.  All plans require one annual inspection by park staff during the growing season (June - August) prior to the sale of material.  Parties submitting quotes must provide documentation of the most recent weed inspection by Yellowstone National Park staff. 
The weed inspection will designate a pit in one of three rating categories:  acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable.  Material from a pit designated as unacceptable can be used if it is heat treated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and promptly transported from the quarry to the park or a pre-approved weed free storage area to prevent possible weed contamination.  The following is a listing of gravel pits currently approved by the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee and tentatively designated as conditionally acceptable by the National Park Service.
Gallatin County (MT):Nuss Pit (TMC) - BStorey Gravel(TMC) - BZuelke - B
Madison County (MT):DSL Pit - B
Park County (MT):Brogan Sand & Gravel - BDan/Due Nelson (Knife River) - BDurgan Rock Pile - BSTS Gravel (Fisher) - B
The control of noxious weeds shall be achieved by the following method:
HAULING:  All vehicles and equipment to be used in Yellowstone National Park shall be thoroughly pressure washed prior to arrival.  Equipment shall be inspected at the appropriate park entrance station by a designated park employee and only clean equipment shall be permitted into the park.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub-regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor to be based in Pretoria, South Africa.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This RA position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The RA will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective PRA, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the PRA; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The RA will report directly to the PRA. However, for certain activities, the RA will coordinate tasks with the respective Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The PRA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The RA is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Amendment #1<br /><br />This amendment #1 to RFP 193505 is issued to provide answers to offeror generated questions and provide a revised Enclosure 5 of the RFP letter.
<p>Specifically this RFP is modified as follows:</p>
<p>The following Offeror generated question and corresponding answer is provided.</p>
<p>Question #1<br />Concerning this tender request I would like to work with some enterprises already accepted by your organization, close to Brookhaven to help me on site as :<br />Entreprise design office to check that the European Standard conforms to the USA standard<br />Enterprise of fitters using crane<br />Entreprise of lightings<br />Enterprise of painting<br />Enterprise to rent tools <br />Etc!!!</p>
<p>Answer #1<br />Please note that the SOW (reference section 3.1.3.4) requires structural certification by a Professional Engineer registered in New York State.

The New York State Education Department/ Office of the Professions maintain a list of licensed engineers (see www.op.nysed.gov/opsearches.htm ). Also, the New York State Society of Professional Engineers (see http://www.nysspe.org/ ) may be able to direct you to members that have the necessary engineering skills that are required by the SOW.</p>
<p><br />Attached and available for download from this website is Revision A of the enclosure 5 NSLS II Beamline Interface information which provides additional clarifications.</p>

Carbon film will be imaged by the manufacturers with a 4k camera at or near 80,000x microscope magnification and a through-focus-series collected from -0.5 to -3.0 &mu;m defocus in 0.5 &mu;m increments at dosages no more than 300 electrons per square nm total dose. Thon rings will be evaluated to determine performance at room temperature. The second specimen will be prepared by the manufacturer for cryoEM. Images of TMV in vitrified ice will be collected and layer lines examined to determine performance under low temperature low dose (cryoEM) conditions. Raw images and any analysis performed by the manufactures will be sent to the Government. The time allowed for this analysis by the offeror will be thirty (30) calendar days.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed products to industry or government agencies. Past performance will consider the ability of the items to meet technical specifications as advertised by the offeror, past record of meeting delivery schedules, meeting performance specs and service/maintenance reputation. Offerors must include at least three recent contracts within the last 3 years that have purchased the same equipment as currently offered, and identify company name, point of contact name, telephone number and email address for each contract. This includes the TEM and camera.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>Q9:&nbsp; Do this bare boards (Not the Assembly) have to be "Made In USA" or ITAR/Export Control requirements?
<p>Or we use offshore supplier as well?</p>
<p><br />Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bare boards without the components maybe fabricated outside the US but some of the components are export controlled and can not be shipped outside the US for populating the printed circuit boards. So if they use a printed circuit board fabricator outside US the boards must be shipped to a US vendor (inside the United States) for population. We can not ship the parts to a vendor with a representative in the US who then ships the parts outside of the US to populate the boards.</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: ELINT COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND EXPLOITATION <br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #10-02 RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to employ emerging technologies to develop and demonstrate automated, real-time signal detection, processing, exploitation, and reporting capabilities of existing and emerging Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) signals and their associated Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) information in support of ground and airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance platforms. Applicable technologies will be used to: (1) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management; (2) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software processes to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future; and (3) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Target characteristic identification/ correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&amp;TI) levels; (4) Software aboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing techniques; and (6) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management.</p>
<p>Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows: (1) Target characteristic identification/ correlation: Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort: (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets. This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination (&lsquo;flagging') of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized. Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and de-interleaving processes using &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts and Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars. (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing: Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena. Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms. Host processing systems will be low power and weight so the resident software processing systems will need to employ a digital receiver and processing schema that operate modularly, in parallel, and in firmware. (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques: Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inference, and real-time operating system. (6) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-int sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management. Deliverables will include technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations.</p>

<p>7. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>All responses, unclassified/classified, to this announcement must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RIEG, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA 10-02-RIKA. Electronic submission is NOT authorized. Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC, Charles Estrella, Charles.Estrella@rl.af.mil, 315-330-7160.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates overall scientific and technical merit for the development and/or enhancement of the technology, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIEG will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at a time of award. In addition, to qualify as a responsible contractor, the offeror may need to have, or have access to, a certified and Government approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):<br />Protected Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM): Augmentation and Next Generation
<p>Response Date: 24 Jun 2011<br />Fedbizops Reference: 11-52</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Description<br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Directorate seeks industry feedback on capabilities and approaches to meet future strategic and protected tactical MILSATCOM needs to increase efficiency and affordability in the 2020-2035 timeframe. More specifically, information is sought on existing technical capabilities, recommended acquisition strategies, and relevant future technologies that reduce risk, cost, complexity, and/or development timelines. The information may encompass alternative protected MILSATCOM architectures (which span space, ground, and terminal segments), hosted payloads, small freeflyers, operational management, and modified or new waveform/protocols. A small freelyer is defined as a small stand alone satellite that is launched on a Falcon-9 launch vehicle.</p>
<p>Protected MILSATCOM is defined as Extremely High Frequency services to both strategic and tactical forces. Protected strategic MILSATCOM must be able to provide low probability of interception/detection/exploitation (LPI/LPD/LPE), survivable, anti-scintillation, and anti-jam communications as well as nuclear command and control services in all operational environments - nuclear, contested, and benign. Protected tactical MILSATCOM must be able to provide anti-jam and LPI/LPD/LPE communications in both contested and benign operational environments.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in obtaining information and recommendations of new systems achieving reductions in cost of protected communications, and the efficient application of future protected MILSATCOM for the strategic and/or protected tactical missions. Affordability must take into account insertion of new technologies to reduce cost, enterprise (space, terminal, ground, control) improvements in manufacturing and production capability and a closer examination of cost driving requirements. Capabilities of a new system(s) must take into account emerging threats, resiliency, information assurance for a wide variety of users, capacity and coverage demands, operational management, terminal segment synchronization, integration with current/future service networks, enterprise life cycle costs, development timelines, acquisition strategies, and risk. These factors may influence recommendations on the overall architecture as well as specific features such as (but not limited to) the orbit(s), constellation size(s), degree of backwards compatibility to the Extended Data Rate waveform, information assurance architecture, cost/complexity per satellite, cost/complexity per terminal, and cost/complexity of the ground segment.</p>
<p>All inquiries pertaining to this RFI shall be made to each of the points of contact (POCs) within this RFI.</p>
<p>Government/Industry Exchange <br />The Government anticipates conducting classified SECRET/NOFORN Industry Day and one-on-one interchange meetings at Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA on&nbsp;26 May. Attendance at these meetings, should they occur, is restricted to those attendees with appropriate and verifiable security clearances. Sources interested in attending must submit an email to the POCs referenced below no later than seven days after this RFI is posted. Interested parties not pre-cleared to attend Industry Day at the classified SECRET/NOFORN level will not be permitted entrance. Further details regarding these meetings will be provided to those interested parties cleared for attendance. The Government will not provide any reimbursement for Industry Day attendance.</p>
<p>Submission of Statement of Capability Package<br />Interested sources are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) package which shall include the following information:<br />&bull; A non-proprietary one page cover sheet reflecting this RFI number &amp; title, the name of your firm/organization, and your technical and administrative POCs - including names, titles, postal address, phone and fax numbers, email addresses, and CAGE code (if applicable)<br />&bull; An executive summary briefly outlining your firm's key ideas/capabilities (two-page limitation)<br />Any significant claims or reports of success must be justified with specific citations, URLs, and/or references</p>
<p>All submissions must consist of the RFI No.11-52 one original, three paper copies, and two CD ROMs of all material in Microsoft Word 2007(1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font), and/or Adobe PDF 9.0. Label each CD ROM clearly with: this RFI #, respondent organization, and POCs. The page limitation for the SOC package is 25 pages (incl. figures &amp; tables). Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410. The small business size standard is $15 Million.</p>
<p>Information submitted in response to this RFI will enhance the Government's ability to acquire quality systems in the future and, therefore, will be used for planning purposes only. All material provided in response to this RFI shall be unclassified, non-confidential, and non-proprietary to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>Interested sources providing confidential/proprietary information in response to this RFI shall separately and clearly identify and mark all confidential/proprietary information. The Government will take all necessary steps to protect/safeguard any confidential/proprietary information provided. The Government will NOT be responsible for any confidential/proprietary information not clearly marked.</p>

<p>3. Identify and characterize available electronic record sources from which these data can be captured.</p>
<p>4. Develop new tools to: <br />a. Process the electronic record selecting both the potentially reportable cancers and the portions of the record which relate to the data elements of interest.<br />b. Electronically transmit these data to the SEER registry(s) that is/are part of the proposed team. <br />c. Generate algorithms/protocols to autocode these data elements and auto-populate data fields in the SEER registry database.</p>
<p>5. Develop quality control metrics for the newly incorporated data (and its relation to other SEER data) and produce an automated quality control report on each data import, and cumulatively on data imported through the application.</p>
<p>6. Monitor the application during a period of data collection of approximately 6 months to 1 1/2 years.</p>
<p>7. Validate the quality of the data relative to manual collection methods and/or the data source.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1975 for the acquisition of Illumina bead chips.  Illumina bead chips are designed to be used with the existing Illumina Instrument System that is located at EPA and cannot be utilized with any other existing fluorescent scanner because of unique chip design. These bead chips are sold only through Illumina. Future experiments will generate data to be compared with existing Illumina data sets at the EPA. Consistency in platform compared is critical to the genomic scientific mission. The research application of Illumina bead chips requires that the chips be scanner on the Ilumina HiScan scanner. The image is displayed on a screen connected to the scanner and analog software generates a density number for each gene, to be used in the analysis. This resource of detailed analys is as well as technical support provided by the supplier is deemed critical to establishing the use of technology in EPAs laboratories and adapting the analysis protocols to specific research applications. EPA has identified Illumina, Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, only one responsible source. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the  date of this publication.

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. Overall Site Boundaries<br />The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. Overall Site Boundaries<br />The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not reimburse the costs of preparing or submitting a response to this Sources Sought Notice.&nbsp; Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary.&nbsp; The winner of the Design Competition may subsequently have the opportunity to enter into a contract with the National Park Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) will manage a design competition to improve the appearance of the security infrastructure used to control unauthorized vehicular use at President's Park South. This notice is to solicit interest in participating in that competition.<br /><br />The proposed design competition will identify alternatives to re-design the security elements while preserving the historic landscape within President's Park South, which includes First Division Monument, Sherman Park, a portion of E Street, the Ellipse roadways, State Place, Hamilton Place, South Executive Avenue, West South Executive Avenue, and East South Executive Avenue.<br /><br />NCPC is a federal agency with a mission that includes planning for federal activities in the greater Washington, DC area. The competition will be administered by the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force in cooperation with the United States Secret Service (USSS) and the National Park Service (NPS).<br /><br />The competition's goal is to generate creative and thoughtful design concepts that integrate durable, more aesthetic USSS security elements and improve the visitor experience in the President's Park South area, which is located immediately adjacent to the White House and its grounds.<br /><br />A selection committee will evaluate each expression of interest with respect to (1) professional qualifications; (2) experience with projects of comparable scale and significance; (3) capacity to accomplish the work; and (4) the ability to obtain a federal security clearance. The committee will identify a list of twelve (12) to fourteen (14) well-qualified firms, from which four firms will then be selected to proceed into the competition's design phase.</p>
<p>The four finalists will be invited to Washington, DC for a full briefing prior to the competition's design portion and will receive a $20,000 honorarium upon submission of their design. In return for accepting the honorarium, finalists agree to waive any proprietary rights or interest in their design concept, and ideas contained in their submission and agree to the incorporation of their design, concepts and ideas, in whole or in part, into a potential solution implemented for President Park South whether or not they are selected to undertake the project.</p>
<p>The finalists will present their designs in a public forum and to the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force - the selection committee for the competition. Following these presentations, the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force will rank the finalists. The winning firm may subsequently have the opportunity to enter into a contract with the National Park Service to refine and potentially execute their design. A formal federal and local review and approval process, including a NEPA Environmental Assessment, will be completed following the competition.<br /><br />Tentative Schedule<br /><br />May 4, 2011 Four finalists selected<br />May 10, 2011 Brief competitors &amp; begin design <br />June 17, 2011 Competition designs submitted to NCPC<br />June 22, 2011 Public meeting to review proposals<br />June 29, 2011 Competition jury<br />July 7, 2011 Announce competition winner</p>

Clarification to Change published Apr 13, 2011 at 10:56 am on FBO to the RFI regarding Section III, Non-GFE Medical Equipment and Supplies: The Government has mandatory sources of supply for some of its medical equipment and supplies (e.g., DLA Prime Vendor Program, etc.).
 In the event that the required item is available through the Governments mandatory source(s) of supply, the Government will coordinate the procurement and delivery to the Service Provider as Government Furnished Equipment or Government Furnished Material (GFE or GFM). In the event that the item is not available from the Governments mandatory source(s) of supply, the Service Provider will be responsible for furnishing the required item via its own supply chain. The Government seeks to leverage the Service Providers supply chain relationships in order to maximize buying power, minimize inventory levels, and improve operational readiness.

The quantities vary per line item and will be noted in the solicitation package.  Items awarded will be mandatory for VA Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services at the VA Medical Centers.  The contract period will be for one year plus four (4) one-year option periods.  If offeror is not a manufacturer, a signed agreement between the offeror and the manufacturer must be submitted with the offer and remain in effect for the duration of the contract period, including option years.  Contracts will be established using competitive negotiated procedures.  Applicable NAICS code is 339113.  This procurement will be a cascading set-aside.  VADALC intends to evaluate offers and make one award per line item utilizing the methodology noted below.

The preferences for Set-Asides are noted in descending order:  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Businesses.  If none of the set-asides can be utilized it will be moved to Full and Open Competition.  The Buy American Act applies to SDVOSB, VOSB, HUBZone SB and SB.  All offerors, regardless of business size, are encouraged to submit proposals for each contract line item.  However, recognizing VA's commitment to the service-disabled veteran-owned small business, veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small business, and small business community, this solicitation will be cascaded to ensure that these small businesses are given every opportunity to participate under this procurement.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)
"MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF AUTOMATIC SWITCHES"

1.	 Contracting Activity: The Department of Veteran Affairs, VISN 22, as directed by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) has a requirement for maintenance and repair of Government owned automatic switches, which will require justification for other than full and open competition.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  VAGLAHS is requesting a firm fixed price service contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  Sole source contractor shall provide maintenance and repair of government-owned automatic switches. The cost for this requirement is $10,000.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:: VAGLAHS is requesting sole source service contract from ASCO Services Incorporated (ASI) to provide maintenance and repair of government-owned automatic switches.  The period of performance is May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This service is being procured under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1; 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1) only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): ASI is the manufacturer of the equipment,  and is qualified based on the following:

(a)	The Government owned automatic switches is over thirty years old and controls all electrical outlets throughout the hospital including, life support machines, dialysis machines and generators. ASI does not sell or license equipment or repairs to any third party vendor.

(b)	If a third party vendor provides maintenance and repair to the automatic switches and it malfunctions, the result will be an electrical outage in the hospital which will result in patient death. The automatic switches are over 30 years old and does not need replacing at this time, but service to ensure optimum working condition. In the event that a switch malfunctions, it will cause treatment delays that could advance to life threatening events including death.  

(c)	 This service contract for the maintenance and repair of the automatic switches is vital to the VAGLAHS and any service discontinuity would have a negative impact on the health and welfare of our veteran patients.  

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable.  Market research was conducted through Vetbiz, and solicitation VA-262-RQ-11-0208 (set aside for SDVOSB) was published from March 15 through March 25, 2011. Both SDVOSB conveyed they would be subcontracting the entire contract to ASI.  Both SDVOSB's would not be performing 51 % of the work. Due to

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)
"MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF AUTOMATIC SWITCHES"

FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting, this would be a violation of federal regulations. Both companies sent an email stating that the only company that can fulfill the requirement without subcontracting would be ASI. A pre-solicitation notice will be published on FEDBIZOPPS announcing the Government's intent to sole source this requirement and will be issued for ten (10) days prior to final determination of competitive interest in this procurement.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and two quotes received by the SDVOSB. 

8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research information was obtained by issuing solicitation VA-262-RQ-11-0208 review of the GSA website, CCR, and Vet Biz, and through historical data.  

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed in Writing an Interest in the Acquisition: There are no other sources that expressed in writing (besides the two SDVOSB that could not fulfill the requirement) an interest in the service other than the manufacturer who can perform the requirements.  

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: None. The anticipated life of the Government Equipment is estimated to be one hundred (100) years. The Government plans to maintain this equipment for the next sixty years to maximize usage of the switches. In order to overcome barriers of competition, the Government shall research other automatic switches before the procurement of a new system. Since the equipment is proprietary, overcoming the barriers for competition cannot be realized at this time.

12.  Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlines in the justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. (Email from using service certification is attached).
