This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department's PKl program.The State Department PKl program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKIlBLADE configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MCreaders to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations 2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.Since Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch, and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Paul Reed, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6034, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email paul.j.reed@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA?s National Marine and Aviation Operation, Office of Ocean Exploration, has a need for the design and installation of a Tele-presence System aboard the NOAA Vessel OKEANOS EXPLORER. 

The tele-presence system will serve a multitude of purposes (including but not limited to the following): (1) Route video from up to 24 HD/SD/analog cameras (12 shipboard, 12 mounted on two remotely operated vehicles) to displays distributed throughout the ship, a video capture/storage subsystem, a video frame grab subsystem, a multi-view subsystem and a video encoder subsystem; (2) Provide a multi-view subsystem for viewing all of the available camera sources on a single display for use by ROV operators and science personnel; (3) Provide a frame grab subsystem capable of capturing and storing individual video frames from HD, SD and analog video sources for use as still imagery; (4) Stores up to three video feeds (possibly HD quality) for up to 20 days.  The stored video must be tagged with the capture date and time as well as the camera source; (5) Routes KVM, and individual VGA signals from up to 24 computers to 14 user stations and view-only LCD stations, distributed throughout the ship; (6) Provides video encoding/IP encapsulation capable of compressing and packaging multiple live, HD quality video for simultaneous transmission to shore-based destinations via satellite link; (7) Provide an intercom subsystem, capable of communicating not only with ship-based intercom stations but also with shore-based stations over an IP-based network via a satellite link.

Description of Operations: The NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER will operate in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, often in areas far offshore. The ship will be outfitted with a two-vehicle ROV system which will carry high-definition video cameras, still cameras, and oceanographic sensors to water depths up to 6,000 meters. The video signals and data will be transmitted from the ROVs to the ship through a 17mm electric/fiber-optic cable to an ROV control room onboard the ship.  ROV position information will be collected via an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) acoustic tracking system also located in the ROV control room. The ship will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar system that will be linked to acquisition and map processing workstations co-located in the ROV control room. The objective of the tele-presence system is to ensure the information from these sources is appropriately distributed to work stations onboard the ship, as well as to ensure the information can be transmitted to shore.

Key Components: Key components and capabilities for the tele-presence include but are not limited to the following: Video encoding subsystem (with embedded audio); Video routing and switching; Multi-view video subsystem; Video format conversion HD/SD/analog; Video frame grab subsystem (HD/SD/analog sources); Video capture and storage subsystem; Onboard video editing workstation; Intercom subsystem; KVM and VGA matrices; and Video displays including: ROV control room (x3) 42 inch high-definition (HD), ROV control room (x4) 8 inch HD, Dry lab (x1) 25 inch HD, Equipment room (x4) 8 inch HD, ROV workshop (x1) 20 inch standard-definition (SD), and Bridge (x1) 20 inch SD.

Full delivery of the system will be required no later than ten (10) months from the date of award. Award is expected in the late August or early September, 2007 time frame.  The solicitation document will be available for download from the FedBizOpps website on or about May 21, 2007. No paper copies will be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION] and [REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR] feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation, thereafter.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE REPLACES THE SAME NOTICE THAT WAS POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, WHICH WAS ACCIDENTALLY DELETED FROM THE FEDBIZOPPS ON THIS DATE.            
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  This project will be funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), DHHS, in conjunction with the NIAID, NIH. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for vaccine candidate(s) for NIAID Category A or B Priority Pathogens (Part A) or a candidate third generation anthrax vaccine (Part B). The purpose of this solicitation is to fund organizations with demonstrated vaccine product development experience to produce a vaccine candidate either for a NIAID Category A or B Priority Pathogen (PART A) or a candidate third generation anthrax vaccine (PART B).  Offerors may propose under both Part A and Part B.  Candidate vaccines eligible for support must have demonstrated safety and proof of concept efficacy in an animal model. Offerors must propose a well-defined and feasible Product Development Plan for advancing the vaccine candidate to achieve the following objectives as specified in the Research and Technical Objectives.  PART A (Base):  Development and update of the Product Development Plan for a NIAID Category A or B Priority Pathogen vaccine candidate (Part A), including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken; manufacturing and formulation process development; manufacturing of pilot lot cGMP material; real time and accelerated vaccine stability studies; conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and immunogenicity studies; development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays necessary to support product development; rapid immune response with no more than two (2) vaccinations; long-term stability of three (3) years or longer at temperatures of at least 35oC; and a safety profile that meets all existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.  PART A Option:  May be exercised at the discretion of the Government to provide support for the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application to the FDA and for the design, conduct, completion and analysis of a Phase 1 clinical trial for contracts awarded to carry out product development activities under Part A for NIAID Category A or B Priority Pathogen vaccine candidates.  PART B (Base):  Development and update of the Product Development Plan for a third generation anthrax vaccine candidate, including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken; manufacturing and formulation process development; manufacturing of pilot lot cGMP material; real time and accelerated vaccine stability studies; conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and multivalent immunogenicity interference studies; development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays necessary to support product development; rapid immune response with no more than two (2) vaccinations; long-term stability of three (3) years or longer at temperatures of at least 35oC; development of stabilization technology that is broadly applicable to a variety of vaccines; a safety profile that meets all existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements; development, submission, and sponsorship of an IND, including compliance with all regulatory requirements; design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 1 dose-escalating clinical trial of the multivalent vaccine candidate in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; and the provision of clinical and non-clinical samples from all studies to NIAID and, for clinical trials, obtaining future use consent from volunteers for their samples.  Part B Option 1 may be exercised at the discretion of the Government to provide for performance of activities associated with scale-up, cGMP manufacturing and release of 200,000 doses of the recombinant protective antigen (rPA)-based third generation anthrax vaccine candidate.  Part B Option 2 may be exercised at the discretion of the Government to provide for the design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate further the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant protective antigen (rPA)-based third generation anthrax vaccine candidate.  In response to PART A, offerors may propose multiple NIAID Category A or B Priority Pathogen vaccine candidate but are required to submit a separate proposal for each vaccine candidate.  Offerors may also submit separate proposals in response to PART B.  It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year base period of performance beginning on or about August 28, 2008.  PART A Option, if exercised, will extend the PART A contract(s) for an additional one year, for a maximum period of performance of four years.  The Options for PART B, if exercised, will extend PART B contract(s) for two years each, for a maximum period of performance of seven years for PART B.  It is estimated that the provision of total FTEs per year will be approximately as follows:  PART A Base = 13.85 FTEs for a 3-year period; PART A Option 1 = 3.5 FTEs for a 1-year period; PART B Base = 13.85 FTEs for a 3-year period; PART B Option 1 = 3.7 FTEs for a 2-year period; and PART B Option 2 = 9.45 FTEs a 2-year period.

<DESC>Office of Naval Research (ONR)Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
for Payload Implosion and Platform Damage Prediction and Validation Implosion is the sudden inward collapse of a pressure resistant structure. For example, a submerged pressure housing with an internal pressure well below the ambient sea pressure may fail due to the external pressure. Following the collapse, a strong pressure wave is radiated into the surrounding fluid. This pressure wave depends sensitively on the exact form of the collapse. The resulting energetic pressure pulse can potentially damage nearby structures. 

The Navy requires an improved capability to design and qualify submarine external payloads for implosion avoidance and platform survivability. Validated, user-friendly tools are required that enable the designer to predict implosion effects, especially the magnitude of the resulting shock waves: In particular, the Navy needs 1) a parametric payload design tool for conventional payloads, and 2) a physics-based model for complex analyses. This requires both algorithm and software development, and carefully controlled measurements to validate the software.

<SUBJECT>R -- Construction and Maintenance Training
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-08-R-00002
<CONTACT>Bob Prior, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)366-4247, Fax (202)366-3705, Email Bob.Prior@dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for the development, revision, updating, and presentation nationwide of training in the broad areas of Highway Construction and Maintenance, Pavement Technologies, and Transportation Asset Management. All work will be identified in task order RFPs issued to those holding one of these base ID/IQ contracts.
  
Current NHI course offering in the areas covered may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional courses or web-based offerings will be added as needs are defined.

The NHI is the technical training arm of the FHWA, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA?s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies. The target audience for these courses is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.

In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission, it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended messages.

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topics since Congress established it in 1970. However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time. These avenues need to be explored, and enhancements to the current approaches implemented. 

In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise will be required in Highway Construction and Maintenance, Pavement Technologies, and Transportation Asset Management including hands on experience in the development and delivery of training in these areas.

Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom instruction, as well as distance learning formats including asynchronous web-based training, synchronous web conference training, and blended approaches of these methodologies. It is estimated that web-based training will make up 30 -50 % of the work during the next 5 years.  Task Orders may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance, translation of course materials into other languages, and conversion of traditional classroom instruction into distance learning formats.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included. 

Unless specifically stated otherwise, the contractor shall furnish all necessary facilities, materials, and personnel to perform services necessary to complete each Task Order issued. 

All qualified, responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer. The Government intends to award multiple contracts on the basis of best value after full and open competition. The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web site that lists all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. However, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements and notification of posting by e-mail. Please note that FedBizOpps has added a new feature called, Interested Vendors List. Those interested in teaming, subcontracting, supplying, consulting and the like should register, and prime contractors should review the names posted there. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps Web site for any solicitation amendments.

The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is October 1st. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation, Short-Term Lending Program offers working capital financing in the form of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable arising from transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $750,000 with interest at the prime rate as published daily in the Wall Street Journal, plus 1.75%. For further information, call (800) 532-1169 x62852.

JUSTIFICATION

The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Sole Source basis for modular furniture to include design and installation.  Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC) has a requirement for reconfiguration of an existing Haworth modular furniture workstations and to include associated component parts/accessories to match existing and therefore the new workstations must be compatible with existing areas for interchangeability.  No other modular furniture will interface with Haworth Furniture. Haworth has provided modular furniture and accessories since 1989, which equates to over 2000 Haworth workstations.  HQ AFPC averages approximately 10-15 reconfiguration projects per year. Haworth is the only known manufacturer of modular furniture that offers the versatility, flexibility, and adaptability that meets HQ AFPC fluid mission needs.  Haworth is the only modular furniture that offers both quick horizontal and vertical change through incremental panels, therefore reducing future reconfigurations costs significantly.  Additionally, with the number of Haworth workstations already installed in the building, new workstations must be compatible with existing areas for interchangeability.  The approximate total replacement value cost is $10,000,000.00; the government would not be able to recoup these costs in a competitive environment.  Therefore, it would not be in the Government?s best interest to procure from another manufacturer. This could result in an adverse effect by negating any existing warranties on the current system.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement for on-site maintenance activities at the FEMA Logistic Center ? Moffett Field located at Building 144, Door 7, Moffett Field, CA 94035.  The services shall consist of but, are not limited to, performing oil and filter changes, performing operation run-ups to operation temperature, the care, servicing, inspection, detection and correction of mechanical discrepancies before these discrepancies can cause serious damage, failure or injury.   The 130 generators at the location, which range in sizes from 10 kW to 1500 kW, are diesel powered as well as five fuel tanks ranging in sizes from 500 to 750 gallons.  The Contractor shall be responsible for performing the work required by the Scope of Work located in Section J of the resultant contract.  

Basis for Award:

Offerors shall submit a list of current and past contracts (with points of contacts) dating back three years in which the Offerors performed similar work as to the requirement being listed by FEMA identifying whether the Offeror was a Prime or Sub-Contractor.  FEMA will utilize the provided information to determine the Offerors? technical qualification to accomplish the required task.  The Offerors will be evaluated on: 

(1) Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? demonstrated past performance in delivering quality products and services and in meeting technical, cost/price, and schedule requirements on similar programs; and to determine that the Offeror demonstrates the application of systemic improvement management practices and minimizing life cycle costs.  The Past Performance risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant past performance.  Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist.  However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement.  The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated.  Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated.  In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown.     

(2)  Technical Qualification:  The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work.  The Government will also evaluate the extent of relevant benefits (if any) that the Offeror gained from each contract/subcontract reference identified and how they relate to the task areas of the statement of work.  The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience.

(3)  Price:  The Government will evaluate the extent that the proposed cost is realistic to complete the requirement.  

Award will be made on Best Value Basis to Government.  Quotes must be priced on F.O.B. Destination.  Interested organizations may submit their quotes via email to Kelly Lynch at Kelly.Lynch@dhs.gov, no later than 12 Noon Eastern Standard Time (EST), on September 26, 2007.

<RESPDATE>091206
<CONTACT>Doug Roark, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5771, Email douglas.roark@dhs.gov
<DESC>Subject:  Request for Information (RFI) for Bottle Screening Devices for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.  General Information: In support of the ongoing effort by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Energy (DOE), as well as the DOE National Laboratories and the commercial sector, it is DHS's goal to investigate any and all potential detection technologies that may assist in the identification of explosive and flammable liquids.  In order to exhaust the list of technologies that are already being investigated and to enhance the opportunities for non-traditional vendors, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS is seeking potential sources of Bottle Screening Devices capable of detecting and distinguishing explosive and flammable liquids from benign liquids (drinks, lotions, hygiene products, contact lens solutions, etc.).  The anticipated application of these devices is screening bottles or other containers at passenger checkpoints, which will require the devices to have a 200 bottle per hour minimum throughput and must meet a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 or greater.  This means that the basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include high-fidelity laboratory integration of components and software.  The device will be expected to function on full or partially full bottles of any shape and color made from glass, plastic, paper or other materials which are typically found in the marketplace and passenger stream of commerce.  DHS is seeking sources offering devices that can be tested within 30 days from the date of any award.  The DHS(S&T) and Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) will use the information gathered from this market survey to develop our source list.  The Government encourages teaming arrangements that will provide the best solution.  To further refine our source list for efficiency purposes, this market survey also requests that interested vendors provide capability statements.  Interested vendors can electronically submit no more than a five page capability statement package (MS Word document).  The page limitation does not include the cover letter.  Congress enacted the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY Act) as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.  The SAFETY Act provides limitations on the potential liability of those firms that develop and provide qualified anti-terrorism technologies.  DHS's Science and Technology Directorate, acting through its Office of SAFETY Act Implementation, encourages the development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies by making available the SAFETY Act's system of risk management, and liability management.  The Science and Technology Directorate invites SAFETY Act applications for technologies that may enhance our current capacity to detect the presence of liquid-based explosive material or components.  Such SAFETY Act applications will receive special attention and be given expedited treatment.  Technologies which are found to be effective in detecting the presence of liquid-based explosives (and thereby meet DHS specifications and requirements) and can be deployed to protect the traveling public will receive SAFETY Act protections.  Written questions are requested early, but shall be electronically delivered no later than 4:00 PM East Coast Time on September 6, 2006, to: douglas.roark@dhs.gov and hshqdc-baa-06-00063-le@hq.dhs.gov.  Written respone submissions are requested early, but shall be electronically delivered no later than 4:00 PM East Coast Time on September 12, 2006,to the two above mentioned email addresses.  The following WEB site will be established by August 24, 2006 for required registration and the forthcoming BAA.  It will also serve as a forum to review submitted questions and corresponding answers:

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to award a sole-source extension to Ricoh Americas Corporation (Ricoh) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of the Technical Information and Management Services Branch. This procurement is to extend the current delivery orders under Contract NAS5-01125 from October 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007 to allow for the completion of the phase-in transition period. The NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) awarded the follow-on contract, an agency-wide multifunctional device (MFD) services contract, to Xerox Corporation effective May 1, 2007 with a 150-day phase-in period from the date of award. The delivery orders were extended through September 30, 2007 to allow for the continuity of services as well as the completion of the phase-in and phase-out period of the successor and incumbent contractor, respectively. It was anticipated that the phase-in and phase-out activities would be completed by September 30, 2007. However, the NSSC notified NASA's GSFC that an extension is necessary for six of the NASA centers. The continued tight coordination between Ricoh, Xerox and the Government is critical in an effort to avoid an interruption in service across the Agency. Due to the necessary phase-in period, Ricoh is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA/GSFC's needs given the magnitude of the effort and the short period of performance of the extension.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>A -- Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women?s Health Initiative II
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-NHLBI-WH-09-01
<ARCHDATE>10122007
<CONTACT>Paul McFarlane, Chief, ECA/WHI Branch, Phone 301-435-0345, Fax 301-480-3430, Email pmcfarlane@mail.nih.gov - Jeffrey Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0338, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women's Health Initiative II


The NIH has supported collection of blood samples and clinical data from participants in the three clinical trials and the observational study of the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI) since 1993.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NHLBI and the WHI centers.  Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a large and concerted effort which may exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of WHI as a whole.  The NHLBI and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important that samples and data collected with public funds be made available, with the least amount of restrictions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.

The NHLBI and NIH programs were reviewed to determine whether existing projects will satisfy the requirement, and the proposed activity was discussed with key staff in NHLBI and other NIH Institutes to determine that this BAA does not replicate other efforts.  The WHI resource is unique in its scope, focus on diseases of older women, ethic and racial diversity, and in particular in that it includes several large randomized controlled clinical trials which are capable of yielding information that cannot be obtained from observational studies.  Care will be taken to ensure that the investigations under this BAA will not duplicate those already performed by the WHI investigators and their colleagues.

The original WHI study population included 161,808 postmenopausal women in the United States, 68,132 (42%) of whom were randomized to one or more components of the clinical trial (CT), and 93,676 (58%) of whom were enrolled in the observational study (OS) between 1993 and 1998.  Recruitment criteria included being 50-79 years of age, being post-menopausal, and planning to live in the area of a given Clinical Center (CC) for three years, with specific exclusionary criteria for the Dietary Modification (DM) and Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial components. Specific study goals were set for ethnic distribution (20% minority women in the CT) and age distribution (30% for 50-59 years of age; 45% for 60-69; 25% for 70-79).  The original cohort was followed until March 31, 2005, after which subjects were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study from 2005 to 2010. As of August 2006 there were 115,273 women (77% of eligibles) enrolled in the Extension Study, during which ascertainment of outcomes (including activities of daily life) has continued together with limited exposure data on use of hormone therapy, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and 24-hour recall of food intake (in a subset).

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource.  This second solicitation follows on a first solicitation issued in January, 2006.  WHI collected extensive information on multiple outcomes, including any disease leading to overnight hospitalization, cancers, self-report of a number of additional conditions, measures of cognition/dementia, sleep, and functional status, amongst others. For this second BAA solicitation, proposals utilizing the data on any of the phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will be considered.  It is anticipated that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  The BAA will not fund new data collection and will make use of existing biologic specimens.
 
In general, the BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive, yet efficient, investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease. For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome and haplotype approaches and studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome.  Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways.  Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of a panel of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample.  On the other hand, focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications. 

Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) are used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state-of-the art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific solution.  Proposals received under this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria as specified in the solicitation, through a peer review process.  Proposals will not be evaluated against a specific Government need, as in the case of a conventional request for proposals (RFP), as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.

The primary basis for selecting proposals submitted in response to this BAA shall be technical excellence, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  The technical evaluation of proposals will be conducted through a peer review process in accordance with established criteria. The evaluation criteria shall evaluate the Offeror?s scientific and technical approach, adequacy of the technical approach, the Offerors? capabilities, and the qualifications, capabilities experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. NHLBI program and administrative staff will determine importance to agency programs and availability of funds.  In addition, past performance of the Offeror and the extent of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the program will also be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.304.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, Size Standard - 500 employees.  It is anticipated that 10 to 14 cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for 2-year periods beginning on or about December 15, 2008. The solicitation will be in the form of a Broad Agency Announcement, numbered BAA-NHLBI-WH-09-01 and will be available electronically on or about September 27, 2007 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. under the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart Lung and Blood postings. Proposals will be due on or about January 29, 2008. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and for routinely checking the Internet site for any solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated.  Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated.  In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown.     

(2)  Technical Qualification:  The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work.

The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience.

(3) Price:  The Government will evaluate the extent that the proposed cost is realistic to complete the requirement.

The VA will evaluate the contractor's performance through intermittent on-site inspections of the contractor's quality control program and via receipt of complaints from VA personnel. The VA may inspect each task as completed or increase the number of quality control inspections if deemed appropriate because of repeated failures discovered during quality control inspections or because of repeated complaints. Likewise the VA may decrease the number of quality control inspections if performance dictates. The VA will also receive and investigate complaints from various personnel located at the site. The contractor shall be responsible for initially validating customer complaints. However the VA will make final determination of the validity of customer complaints in cases of disagreement with customers. 3.11	Invoicing: Invoices for payment shall be submitted in areas after the4 service is performed. Monthly invoicing is recommended. The following information must appear on invoices; 	. Contractor's name/address/phone number 	. Contract number 	.

Total invoice amount Note: Invoice $ amounts must match the agreed upon contract pricing. Invoices listed incorrect information such as incorrect $ amounts unallowable charges etc. will be returned unpaid to the contractor for correction. Note: Service holds or &quot;credit holds&quot; which result in a disruption of service will not be allowed. Any invoicing/payment problem which cannot be resolved through the usual process of resolution by those responsible for this process should be referred to the Contracting Officer. The contractor's actual or threatened incidences of credit holds will likely result in the contract's options not being extended by the VAS and could also lead to termination of the contract for default. 4. SERVICE DELIVERY SUMMARY; 	The contractor service requirements are summarized into primary performance objectives. The performances threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service provided for each requirement. These thresholds are considered critical to acceptable performance.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department's PKl program.The State Department PKl program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKIlBLADE configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MCreaders to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations 2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.Since Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch, and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.<BR><BR>

Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

The Government anticipates award of a fixed-price, indefinite delivery (requirements) type contract.

Solicitation number 263-2006-P(GI)-0112 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fbo.gov/, on or about August 15, 2007.

<DESC>This announcement is hereby amended to include a closing time to the due date.  ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST ARRIVE ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME.  THE CLOSING DATE FOR RESPONSES IS JULY 10, 2006.  THE CLOSING TIME FOR THE RESPONSES IS 3:30 PM.

The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to issue a statement of work (SOW) to obtain services related to the design, development, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of a new, publicly available, web-based application for cataloging all known dietary supplement labels sold in the United States in a database tentatively called Dietary Supplements Label Database (DSLD). The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback from capable vendors that will help finalize the SOW.  

The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities.  The pre-solicitation conference is to be used to 1) disseminate background data that offer further insight into the size and complexity of this acquisition, as well as the risks of undertaking this project, 2) clarify and inform the development of a detailed statement of work, and 3) discuss anticipated difficulties.  

A complete and comprehensive source of information containing virtually all dietary supplement labels does not currently exist. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) supplement label database is incomplete, as it contains only supplements reported by survey respondents.  The need for DSLD is apparent from numerous communications of stakeholders, from Congress, and deliberations within the ODS. It is hoped that an existing Federal database can be further developed so as to allow the research community and other interested stakeholders free access to dietary supplement label information.  

Such an application is needed as a resource both for research and educational purposes. The need for a complete, comprehensive, publicly available and readily accessible source of total label information and data is increasing as sales and use of dietary supplements grow (Radimer K et al, Am J Epi 160:339, 2004).  ODS believes that industry cooperation is essential to obtain complete coverage of all dietary supplements sold in the United States. 

The ultimate NIH goal is a DSLD containing label information for all products marketed and sold through all distribution channels in the United States. This would meet the research and informational needs of research investigators, health professionals, Federal and state agencies, and consumers. Researchers conducting epidemiological studies would find the dietary supplement database application useful in estimating total exposures to various dietary supplement ingredients and their associations with health outcomes. Researchers planning clinical trials require information on dietary supplement content for calculation of interventions involving them and in assessing and planning dietary intakes. Federal and state agencies need information on the content of dietary supplements to estimate current intakes and to plan nutritional interventions and recommendations. 

DSLD would also meet the needs of other segments of the dietary supplement community.  Dietitians would be able to obtain information on the composition of dietary supplement products for computing dietary intakes of nutrients or other bioactive constituents. Health professionals would be able to search for ingredients with beneficial or adverse effects. Industry might find product formulations or comparisons with competitive products of interest. Policy makers might find the application useful for calculating the contributions of various dietary supplements to total nutrient intakes. 

The immediate goal of this Request for Information is to identify capable vendors and solicit ideas on the development processes so as to inform the finalizat processes so as to inform the finalization of a Statement of Work.  An integral part of this work is understanding and defining both the technical components and processes and the project management components and processes. 

ODS anticipates a 12-month requirements (feasibility) development effort.  Requirements development should be approached by the vendor becoming familiar with other Federal research efforts in this area for the purposes of interfacing.  At its completion, ODS requires a report defining the feasibility of continuing this effort into its design phase and delivery of a prototype dietary supplements label database.  

It is important that the DSLD interface well with existing databases, especially the NHANES/ NCHS/CDC survey dietary supplement label database and the USDA/ARS standard reference database for food composition, in order to maximize the utility of the DSLD for the government, researchers, and the public. 

Contractors expressing an interest should provide appropriate capability statements.  The capability statement shall include the following: 
1) Description of the organization’s experience and past performance with large, complex databases for use in research
2) CV’s for key personnel, including the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement.  
3) Description of the vendor’s ability to access labels and required information in order to populate the DSLD, including a sampling plan to demonstrate the ability to capture the full range of products in the marketplace. 
4) Sample content (both nutrient and non-nutrient) to be included in DSLD. 
5) Steps to ensure accuracy and quality of information in DSLD, including how to deal with complex issues such as a) capturing digital images of labels, b) methods to identify products with a unique number or code to facilitate product identification building on those already in use in other Federal databases, c) methods to distinguish among such factors as validation of quantification of true zeros, missing data, etc., d) methods for verifying the validity of information contained the sample labels, e) methods for converting the label information into units compatible with those in other Federal government databases, f) documentation of how changes in labels will be documented promptly in DSL D, g) documentation of likely challenges anticipated in developing DSLD, such as use of structured vocabulary or dictionary of synonyms, and h) methods for freezing data for archiving and reporting. 
6) Plan for producing a DSLD prototype at the conclusion of a forecasted 12-month requirements development effort.
7) Outline of how DSLD will integrate with the existing National Center for Health Statistics NCHS/NHANES Dietary Supplement Database and the USDA Standard Reference Food Composition Database.  
8) Detailed summary of the process to be used in requirements development.
9) Examples of user-interface design completed on projects of similar size and/or complexity.
10) Discussion of preferred programming code to be used during program code construction.
11) Discussion of effort and experience involved in system testing and quality assurance testing.
12) Copy of certified level of maturity, as it related to CMMI: Capability Maturity Model Integration
13) Names and numbers of three references from former clients involved in an effort of similar size and/or complexity including contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and title of individual. 
14) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance NIH’s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 
15) Name and address of firm.
16) Type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.)
17)  Point of contact: name, title, phone, fax and e-mail.
18)  DUNS number, NAICS codes 
19) A statement that the contractor has registered in the central contractor registration (ccr) data base (http://www.ccr.gov).

Only the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer (BCPO) can approve a waiver from CCR registration and permit the award action, if the contractor is not registered in CCR. Any contractor meeting an exception or obtaining a waiver from CCR registration is still required to get an EFT account in order to receive electronic payments, in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act.  Contractors shall then submit a completed Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (formerly SF 3881) directly to:
Internal Revenue Service
Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology
P. O. Box 3339,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-3339
Or Fax to:  (513) 263-5020

The ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form can be obtained from the IRS Contracting Officer or from the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology, points of contact, Joan Aker or Nancy Estep at (513) 263-5069/5055, if not included in this solicitation/award.

In order for contractor invoices to be determined proper and payments made under applicable awards, contractor EFT information must be valid and current.  Valid contractor EFT information must include the Agency information; the Payee/Company information including Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and the Contractor's financial institution information, including the nine-digit routing transit number, account type and account number.  If the contractor is registered in CCR, changes can be made to its business profile at any time.  Under this award, if any changes are made to the mandatory business information in CCR, the contractor is required to notify the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Under this award, those contractors not registered in CCR but enrolled in EFT payments, are also required to report any changes to their business information to the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Contractors can e-mail notification of their changed CCR and EFT business information directly to: CFOBFC.CCRPaymentinformation@irs.gov

Valid contractor EFT payment information is required in order for the Government to make any payment under this award. Invoices received prior to the receipt of valid EFT information shall be deemed improper for the purpose of prompt payment under this award and payments will be rejected or suspended.  Contractors may only request a waiver from EFT payments if they meet one of the criteria listed on the Request for Waiver of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment Form.  The waiver request form can be obtained via the Contracting Officer or the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology at telephone (513) 263-5069/5055 or e-mail Nancy.V.Estep@irs.gov or Joan.Aker@irs.gov.

<DESC>Questions have been recieved regarding the formal RFP released on Sep 14. See below for the Gov't replies. Additonal postings may occur up until Oct 29th is/when additional questions are recieved.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Question 1) Paragraph 5.2 Early Proposal Information in Section L states "Each offeror is requested to submit the information shown in Attachment 3 for each relevant contract fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals." But Table 2.2 - Proposal Organization indicates these attachments are part of Volume III, the Past Performance volume. Does the Government wish the entire Volume III submitted 15 days early or should the Attachment III PPISs be submitted seperately 15 days early, and also included with the completed Volume III at the normal due date (29 October 2007)? (Answer 1) Per the instructions in Para 5.2, the Government only desires the PPIS sheets be submitted 15 days early and not the entire past performance volume. If an offer does indeed submit the PPIS early, they would not be expected to provide additional copies as part of Vol III. If an offeror is unable to provide these PPIS early, then Vol III, would be the proper place to provide them as part of their proposal. Additionally, since 15 days prior to Oct 29th is a Sunday, submission 14 days early on Oct 15th will be sufficient. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Question 2) The sentence cited above from Paragraph 5.2 states "... offeror is requested to submit...". We wish to confirm that the use of the word "requested" indicates that an offeror who, for whatever reason, is unable to complete the PPISs in time to meet the earlier date will not be penalized, so long as the completed proposal, including a complete Volume III, is submitted by the 29 October due date. (Answer 2) The Government uses the word "requested" in Par 5.2 as inferred above. The Gov't would like to see the PPIS sheets early if possible to give us a head start on performing the Past Performance reviews. However, compliance with this early submission is not mandatory and failure to do so will NOT result in an unfavorable evaluation. As a reminder, a complete Vol III "IS" required no later than Oct 29th as part of an offerors complete proposal.

Any responsible source meeting the small business criteria may submit a proposal that will be considered.

GSA will provide site access, Contractor must produce a report detailing energy conservation measures recommended, using DOE BLCC version 5.3-07.  Following kickoff meeting, Contractor must notify building manager one week prior to site visits, and must obtain Federal Protective Service clearance and obtain building badge for all personnel working on site.  Contractor should begin process of submitting background forms and fingerprint cards immediately after purchase order award.  Work must be complete and report submitted not later than December 31, 2007.

A purchase order will be issued to the successful offeror.  The purchase order will be time and materials, not to exceed $75,000, with the maximum travel cost a not-to-exceed subtotal.  Contractor must report exact hours worked by individual and rate, and reimbursable expenses, no less frequently than weekly, using a GSA provided work order system.

Price proposals must be valid through September 28, 2007.   Email questions to Mark.Levi@gsa.gov by 12 Noon PDST Tuesday September 21, 2007, to assure time for a response. Answers to substantive questions will be posted to FBO under this solicitation number.

TITLE: DYNAMIC AIR AND SPACE EFFECTS BASED ASSESSMENT (DASEA)

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-07-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 22 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Jun 05; FY 07 by 1 Jun 06; FY 08 by 1 Jun 07; and FY 09 by 1 Jun 08.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Objective: The overall objective of this BAA is to design, develop and demonstrate a capability for continuous effects based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  This program will employ, exploit and develop as necessary technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide for spiral development and interaction with other ongoing Air Force programs.  Familiarity with  initiatives that are focused on dynamic tasking and effects based assessment, as well as those technologies that are necessary to support these functions (e.g. multi-INT fusion) are desirable.  Specific efforts targeted for collaboration include: 1. the Command and Control Battle Lab's T-BONE  effort which is focused on rewriting the Theater Air Planning (TAP) capability and the Air Operations Database (AODB).  2. The U.S. Air Force Effects Based Assessment Task Force initiative. 3. DARPA's JAGUAR (Joint Air-Ground Unified Adaptive Re-planning) program.  4. AFRL's PANACIA (Predictive Awareness and Network-Centric Analysis for Collaborative Intel Assessment).  And 5. AFRL/HE's AOC Strategy Planning and Operational Effects Assessment Visualization Effort (04-01-HE-04).   In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complimentary activities including test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, and data collection and management.

Background: The current planning process for air operations takes commander's intent and turns it into orders that executing units carry out. Mission data and orders are documented and sent to executing units in a batch-oriented Air Tasking Order (ATO). To counter emerging threats or exploit emerging opportunities, commanders require the means of reacting very quickly. This argues against a batch-oriented process and towards a more continuous process.  In the near future, executing orders might be available in a Dynamic Air/Space Execution Order (DAEO) or in a continuous "streaming ATO".  This envisions a largely continuous process where target queues are dynamically executed as they are built.  Crucial to a DAEO or streaming ATO process is the ability to conduct effects based assessment (EBA).  Assessment activities need to begin well before tasks are executed. During the planning process, assessment requirements are an integral part of the DAEO generation. During execution, assessment activities need to determine the likelihood that the course of action will attain commander's intent. The focus of combat assessment today is on actions rather than effects and results in recommendations concerning re-attacks.  In addition to re-attack recommendations, effects based assessment must look at whether the basic strategy of the campaign or major operation should be changed.  This Critical Experiment will result in a capability for achieving effects-based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  New processes for effects-based assessment will be developed and evaluated under this initiative.  Technologies to support accurate and timely EBA based on the new processes will be developed.  Effects based assessment methods for a streaming ATO need to be developed.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods for reasoning under uncertainty in a dynamic environment should be explored.  Note, this effort is focused on exploiting multi-INT fusion capabilities, not developing them.

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  WE ARE SOLICITATING WHITE PAPERS ONLY.   DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. See Section VI of this announcement for further details.    

For additional information, a copy of the AFRL/Rome Research Sites "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): A Guide for Industry," April 2007, may be accessed at: http://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLRRS/Reference%2DNumber%2DBAAGUIDE/listing.html.  

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:   Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to five 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict their white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 22 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Jun 05; FY 07 by 1 Jun 06; FY 08 by 1 Jun 07; and FY 09 by 1 Jun 08.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  Submission of white papers will be regulated in accordance with FAR 15.208.

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Nancy Koziarz, AFRL/IFSA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome NY 13441-4505   Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA 04-07-IFKA.

Electronic submission to Nancy.Koziarz@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.  Reference BAA 04-07 in the subject line.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are equal in importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Scientific and technical merit including creativity of proposed solution to the problem, (2) Soundness of offeror's proposed approach to developing and testing dynamic execution and effects based assessment capabilities, (3) Understanding of the dynamic tasking and effects based assessment problem.  This includes the offeror's understanding of current approaches and military doctrine in these areas. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed cost and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret or top secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret or top secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Nancy Koziarz, telephone: (315) 330-2828 or email Nancy.Koziarz@afrl.af.mil.

<DESC>?	Consequence Modeling Software.

The objective is to procure general purpose chemical plant accident modeling software.  This software will allow investigators the option of performing calculations internally when appropriate.  It may also provide for screening studies that could better inform decisions on whether more detailed analyses are worthwhile.

The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) requires software capable of estimating the magnitude of leaks given process conditions and failure modes, and then modeling dispersion of the leak.  It should also be able to calculate fire and blast effects for releases of explosive or flammable chemicals.  The software must provide CSB investigative staff the ability to make a wide variety of calculations related to chemical mixtures for phenomena such as:

?	Analyses of various multi-component leak scenarios caused by pipe or vessel rupture, relief valve discharge, rupture disk breakage, pool evaporation, etc.;

?	Atmospheric dispersion of toxic and flammable releases;

?	Basic explosion modeling using the TNO multi energy and Baker-Strelow-Tang methods; and

?	Radiation modeling of pool, jet fires, or bleves.

CSB?s core mission is protecting workers and the public from incidents at chemical plants.  To be credible to its stakeholders CSB must be able to generate reasonable reconstructions of incidents.  Software that meets all the requirements stated above will allow the CSB to internally develop a hypothesis for a leak from a ruptured pipeline in a chemical plant from incident and scene data.  Then, from incident timing data and atmospheric conditions CSB could model the dispersion of the leaked material.  That would in turn lead to a theoretical blast model that could be compared to actual blast damage observed.  Finally, if there was an ensuing fire CSB could model and explain knock on effects that may have lead to further incident development.  In short, only software with the ability to do all these things would permit CSB investigators to reconstruct accidents without relying on a multitude of external experts or contractors.

To the best of CSB?s knowledge the only software product with the integrated features described above that is capable of modeling the release of multi-component releases is Phast.  This is because Phast integrates the DIPPR database from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and has the additional capability to generate mixture properties.  Other consequence modeling software is not capable of generating similar thermodynamic data for mixtures.

The deliverable for this procurement is a single license for software that meets the objective and requirements stated above and is capable of running on Windows based personal computers.


Interested offerors must contact Alan Dotson at 304-480-7206 or by email at William.Dotson@bpd.treas.gov to express interest in participating in the solicitation no later than 2:00 pm et on Monday, September 24, 2007.

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with EMC Corporation for Symmetrix hardware and software maintenance and support renewals. The Government intends to award for a single year, with pro-rated pricing for multiple start dates and co-terminating end date of 9-30-08.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

TTB Background:  On January 24, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the Act) established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury.  The main responsibilities of TTB are protecting the public and collecting revenue.  These responsibilities are carried out by developing regulations, conducting product analyses, and ensuring tax and trade compliance with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and the Internal Revenue Code. 

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau relies on the EMC ware as a critical part of its infrastructure.  It is imperative that this hardware and software is maintained and supported in a way that allows TTB?s infrastructure to be operational at all times. The software has been specifically developed by and solely maintained by EMC.  No other party is authorized to provide upgrades, up-dates or de-bug the TTB software.  The EMC microcode is confidential.  Diagnostic tools specifically developed for equipment maintenance by EMC are proprietary, and no other party is authorized to utilize them.  A sole source to EMC Corporation is intended for this order as no other known source has access to this license.
No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than three days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to EMC Corp. If you would like a copy of the Sole Source Justification, please fax or e-mail your request.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).       The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC SD) â€“ Information Technology Engineering Branch is seeking industry input/comment for the pending Neurochip requirement in support of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Neurochip program. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Additionally, the Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.     Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     The results of this RFI will be used to finalize development of the subsequent Request for Proposal. This requirement is in support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Neurochip program.   NIDA/ONDCP plans to generate a customized SNP array (Neurochip) for studies to investigate the genetics and pharmacogenetics of drug addiction and related disorders. The objective of the Neurochip contract is to more accurately estimate genetic contributions to the addiction process. It is expected that the Neurochip may facilitate the identification of those populations genetically vulnerable to drug dependence, those vulnerable to consequences of drug abuse, as well as those most likely to benefit from medications and other therapies tailored to a personâ€™s genetic make-up to treat certain addictions. The Neurochip contract directly supports National Priority II of the February 2007 National Drug Control Strategy: Healing Americaâ€™s Drug Users. The program objective of the NIDA and ONDCP Neurochip contract is to generate a customized SNP array, Neurochip, for studies to investigate the genetics and pharmacogenetics of drug addiction and related disorders. The Neurochip will be based on at least a 500,000 SNP sample array platform as a base which also allows for additional user-specified SNPs. The Neurochip will contain over 7,000 custom SNPs chosen to provide in- depth coverage of specific genes that, through previous work, are believed to be associated with drug addiction and/or related disorders. The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) defines the Neurochip program goals.   The purpose of this RFI is to: (1) gather ideas as to whether the attached draft SOO and evaluation criteria encompasses all aspects needed to successfully respond to a RFP; (2) market research to further identify potential bidders based on submissions; and (3) finalize the RFP and acquisition strategy. Responses to this RFI shall include: Company name, address, point of contact, telephone/fax number, and email address; Indication of business size status (such as large business, small business, disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned; Comments on the draft SOO and Evaluation Criteria: Suggested Contract Type, Contract Line Item (CLIN) structure, Evaluation Criteria, SOW, and overall approach; All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than October 1, 2007 by 2:00 PM Pacific Time via electronic transmission to the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website. The URL for the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central is https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  First time users of this site are encouraged to access the link titled â€œRead Me First!â€, and then register through the link titled â€œSubmitting a Proposal?â€.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, ARDEC-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to obtain  well rounded contractors who have demonstrable experience in providing a wide  variety of machine shop equipment, laboratory equipment and related facilities  maintenance support and prototype manufacturing support for the Armaments  Engineering & Technology Center. The required maintenance service will include but is not limited to repair,  calibration, adjustment, parts, maintenance supplies, disassembly and  assembly, utility connects and disconnects associated with equipment including  electrical, electronic, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic components and  systems. The required maintenance equipment list includes but is not limited  to servicing: Numeric Control/Computer Numeric Control (NC/CNC) equipment,  mills, lathes, drills, grinders, saws, sheet metal equipment, welding  equipment, presses, heat treating equipment, compressors, environmental  chambers, drying and aging ovens, explosives machining lathes and test  equipment.  Additionally, the contractor must be capable of refurnishing  existing equipment, and restoring to operation. All maintenance support is for equipment located at Picatinny.  Consequently,  respondent and employees proximity to Picatinny is very desirable, as  contractors need to be close by to provide daily support and respond to urgent  requests (defined as less than six hours) by the ARDEC technical segment for  maintenance/manufacturing support.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of a Database of Dietary Supplement Labels
<DESC>The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to issue a statement of work (SOW) to obtain services related to the design, development, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of a new, publicly available, web-based application for cataloging all known dietary supplement labels sold in the United States in a database tentatively called Dietary Supplements Label Database (DSLD). The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback from capable vendors that will help finalize the SOW.  

The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities.  The pre-solicitation conference is to be used to 1) disseminate background data that offer further insight into the size and complexity of this acquisition, as well as the risks of undertaking this project, 2) clarify and inform the development of a detailed statement of work, and 3) discuss anticipated difficulties.  

A complete and comprehensive source of information containing virtually all dietary supplement labels does not currently exist. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) supplement label database is incomplete, as it contains only supplements reported by survey respondents.  The need for DSLD is apparent from numerous communications of stakeholders, from Congress, and deliberations within the ODS. It is hoped that an existing Federal database can be further developed so as to allow the research community and other interested stakeholders free access to dietary supplement label information.  

Such an application is needed as a resource both for research and educational purposes. The need for a complete, comprehensive, publicly available and readily accessible source of total label information and data is increasing as sales and use of dietary supplements grow (Radimer K et al, Am J Epi 160:339, 2004).  ODS believes that industry cooperation is essential to obtain complete coverage of all dietary supplements sold in the United States. 

The ultimate NIH goal is a DSLD containing label information for all products marketed and sold through all distribution channels in the United States. This would meet the research and informational needs of research investigators, health professionals, Federal and state agencies, and consumers. Researchers conducting epidemiological studies would find the dietary supplement database application useful in estimating total exposures to various dietary supplement ingredients and their associations with health outcomes. Researchers planning clinical trials require information on dietary supplement content for calculation of interventions involving them and in assessing and planning dietary intakes. Federal and state agencies need information on the content of dietary supplements to estimate current intakes and to plan nutritional interventions and recommendations. 

DSLD would also meet the needs of other segments of the dietary supplement community.  Dietitians would be able to obtain information on the composition of dietary supplement products for computing dietary intakes of nutrients or other bioactive constituents. Health professionals would be able to search for ingredients with beneficial or adverse effects. Industry might find product formulations or comparisons with competitive products of interest. Policy makers might find the application useful for calculating the contributions of various dietary supplements to total nutrient intakes. 

The immediate goal of this Request for Information is to identify capable vendors and solicit ideas on the development processes so as to inform the finalization of a Statement of Work.  An integral part of this work is understanding and defining both the technical components and processes and the project management components and processes. 

ODS anticipates a 12-month requirements (feasibility) development effort.  Requirements development should be approached by the vendor becoming familiar with other Federal research efforts in this area for the purposes of interfacing.  At its completion, ODS requires a report defining the feasibility of continuing this effort into its design phase and delivery of a prototype dietary supplements label database.  

It is important that the DSLD interface well with existing databases, especially the NHANES/ NCHS/CDC survey dietary supplement label database and the USDA/ARS standard reference database for food composition, in order to maximize the utility of the DSLD for the government, researchers, and the public. 

Contractors expressing an interest should provide appropriate capability statements.  The capability statement shall include the following: 
1) Description of the organization’s experience and past performance with large, complex databases for use in research
2) CV’s for key personnel, including the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement.  
3) Description of the vendor’s ability to access labels and required information in order to populate the DSLD, including a sampling plan to demonstrate the ability to capture the full range of products in the marketplace. 
4) Sample content (both nutrient and non-nutrient) to be included in DSLD. 
5) Steps to ensure accuracy and quality of information in DSLD, including how to deal with complex issues such as a) capturing digital images of labels, b) methods to identify products with a unique number or code to facilitate product identification building on those already in use in other Federal databases, c) methods to distinguish among such factors as validation of quantification of true zeros, missing data, etc., d) methods for verifying the validity of information contained the sample labels, e) methods for converting the label information into units compatible with those in other Federal government databases, f) documentation of how changes in labels will be documented promptly in DSL D, g) documentation of likely challenges anticipated in developing DSLD, such as use of structured vocabulary or dictionary of synonyms, and h) methods for freezing data for archiving and reporting. 
6) Plan for producing a DSLD prototype at the conclusion of a forecasted 12-month requirements development effort.
7) Outline of how DSLD will integrate with the existing National Center for Health Statistics NCHS/NHANES Dietary Supplement Database and the USDA Standard Reference Food Composition Database.  
8) Detailed summary of the process to be used in requirements development.
9) Examples of user-interface design completed on projects of similar size and/or complexity.
10) Discussion of preferred programming code to be used during program code construction.
11) Discussion of effort and experience involved in system testing and quality assurance testing.
12) Copy of certified level of maturity, as it related to CMMI: Capability Maturity Model Integration
13) Names and numbers of three references from former clients involved in an effort of similar size and/or complexity including contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and title of individual. 
14) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance NIH’s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 
15) Name and address of firm.
16) Type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.)
17)  Point of contact: name, title, phone, fax and e-mail.
18)  DUNS number, NAICS codes 
19) A statement that the contractor has registered in the central contractor registration (ccr) data base (http://www.ccr.gov).

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information - Active Infrared Imaging Through Clouds and Fog #2
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - SN07-54, Active Infrared Imaging through Clouds and Fog #2


DESCRIPTION

Obstruction by clouds and fog is, and will continue to be, a major limitation to electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) imaging systems.   Yet EO/IR technology is evolving rapidly and EO/IR systems will continue to find ever-increasing use in military applications.   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) has current and future interest in advancing EO/IR capabilities through the use of active imaging and coherent techniques.   The Synthetic Aperture Ladar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) program, for example, has demonstrated a break-through to achieve the first-ever synthetic aperture ladar imaging from aircraft.   DARPA released a Request for Information (RFI SN07-29) on 27 April 2007 with a similar, but broader scope.  Currently we are interested only on loss-mitigation approaches applicable to coherent LADAR that would preserve the bandwidth and phase of signals propagating through clouds, fog, and haze.

DARPA/STO is requesting information on novel research ideas and approaches  for improving the performance of EO/IR active coherent imaging systems in environments degraded by cloud cover, haze and fog.   No funding has currently been allocated to this effort, A Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this RFI.

Responses should be limited to mitigation approaches that would enable or significantly improve the performance of EO/IR active coherent imaging systems such as LADAR in clouds, fog and haze conditions.   Responses should identify whether they would (a) accept exponential attenuation (Beer's law), or (b) avoid Beer's law.

In active imaging, range resolution is a function of the bandwidth of the returning signal.  This is true even for direct detection, i.e. short pulses.  Selective absorption and dispersion turn short pulses into longer pulses, which would degrade the range resolution.  The Impulse Response Function is a function of the spectral integrity and/or the ability to whiten/equalize the signal.  Finally, for synthetic aperture systems, the ratio of the spatial correlation parameter to synthetic aperture length is critical.  DARPA/STO is concerned not only with received power but with preservation of bandwidth and coherence over the full transmitted space-frequency aperture spectral integrity and the wave structure function.  

Interested parties should submit their position paper by responding to this RFI as described in the instructions to follow.  Responders my resubmit white papers previously submitted under RFI SN07-29 only if they include additional citations and/or reference material or if they more clearly quantitatively address attenuation improvement and/or bandwidth/phase preservation/clutter rejection.




INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS

This announcement contains all information required to submit a position paper. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to universities, university affiliated research centers, federally-funded research centers, private or public companies, and Government research laboratories.

<SUBJECT>--An Operant Test System.
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to award a sole source purchase order to MED Associates, Inc. Industrial Park Rd., Milton, VT 05468 for an Operant Test System. The experimental apparatus from MED Associates allows for the si multaneous testing of 8 rodents, each housed within a specialized operant conditioning chamber within a sound-attenuating cubicle. Each chamber is equipped with many components for presenting a variety of stimuli (sounds and lights), recording a variety of  responses (nose pokes, lever presses, and food or liquid consumption), and reinforcers (food pellets, electric shock, and liquids). The system is digitally interfaced to a computer that provides timing at millisecond resolution and runs specialized softwa re for presenting stimuli and recording responses to measure virtually any aspect of operant or respondent conditioning. The system ideally accommodates both guinea pigs and rats and is modular in nature to allow for easy cleaning and interchangeability of  the various components.  This procurement will be executed under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The purchase of this system complements and exte nds the current in-house operant testing capability within the laboratory. These hardware and software components have been validated and utilized extensively at USAMRICD. These test systems are completely modular, components and subcomponents that are com pletely interchangeable with the components already in the lab, thereby allowing the most efficient use of resources in support of the research. The advanced use of this system requires researchers to write their own specific software protocols  the MED As sociates MED-PC language. Procurement of another system would require a different proprietary programming language that would be time- and labor-prohibitive.  This is not a request for a competitive quote. Any response to this notice must be submitted in w riting to the Government providing clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  All responses will be considered, but  the Contracting Officer retains the right to determine the procurement strategy, based on available information. If no written responses are received by 12 Noon or September 27, 2007, the purchase will be awarded without further notice. See FedBizOpps Not e 22.

Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance for Big 1000 and 2400RCU.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features: •	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available.  •	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.   •	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.  •	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network.  •	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.  •	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system.  •	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware.<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Due to CA’s investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government’s best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance<BR><BR>

REQUESTOR BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION
Due to a 2 to 3 month delay in contractual negotiations to renovate Building 947 to accommodate our campus expansion from a 4-unit campus to a 5-unit campus, Western Region Campus needs to secure an alternative plan for member feeding during Corps Training Institute from October 17, 2007 through November 26, 2007.  During this time, members will be undergoing introductory training.  

October 17, 2007 is in-processing day and we will need to provide boxed lunches and members arrive to campus and dinner to all member arrivals.

October 18-October 21: members will receive training on safety and procedures on how to use the cooking facilities.  During this time, Western Region will need to provide breakfast, lunch and dinner to the full corps.

October 21 ? November 26, 2007: Members will begin cooking breakfast and lunch for themselves because those meals require light usage of the kitchens.  For dinner, units will rotate being catered because we do not have enough kitchens for a 5 unit campus until building 947 is available.  Therefore, we will cater 1 unit per day or approximately 115 people for dinner everyday.

Commercial Items, and FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders?Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  
NAICS:   541512

Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The purpose of this action is to renew the DFAS BEA AquaLogic software suite licenses for a base year contract plus four (4) option years. The DFAS Enterprise Portal (ePortal) software suite consists of AquaLogic Corporate Portal, Documentum Foundation, Developer Studio, Web Publisher, AquaLogic Interaction Publisher, YellowBrix, AquaLogic Oblix and AquaLogic Interaction Processor. 

Prices:  THE AWARD SHALL BE MADE TO THE LOW COST, TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE OFFER.   THE GOVERNMENT MAY DETERMINE THAT AN OFFER IS UNFAVORABLE IF OPTION PRICES ARE NOT SUPPLIED OR ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNBALANCED. 

Contract Base Year Period of Performance: October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008.

Invoices:  Shall be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) to a WAWF acceptor that will be identified in the resulting contract.

As of February 1, 2007 the DFAS Contract Services Directorate (issuing office) no longer makes paper or email distribution of contract documents. All DFAS contracts and modifications are available on the Electronic Document Access (EDA) website (http://eda.ogden.disa.mil).

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

BEA Systems, Inc. competed and won the award for the deployment of, maintenance of, consulting services for and training for the DFAS Enterprise Portal.  BEA Systems, Inc.  is the sole provider of the software that provides this portal product. They are uniquely qualified to assist DFAS? business lines in creating, enhancing and expanding the use of each business lines? portal functionality to DFAS? external customers.

DFAS has invested over $90 million in web technology to include software licenses, maintenance, training, but especially the development of communities, applications and projects.  The BEA AquaLogic software upgrades and releases are in synch with the DFAS architecture, configuration, infrastructure and environment.  The software is essential to the DFAS mission in that it was built from the ground up for DFAS.  The proprietary software was   tailored to DFAS requirements, to include security and access levels.  All applications on the ePortal have been conformed to Section 508 Compliances.  

The man hours, knowledge base of personnel, investment in online and classroom training, development of communities and projects have been ongoing for five years.  There are ongoing major releases scheduled to upgrade software for synchronization with upgrades in hardware configurations.  The risks associated with a change from BEA AquaLogic are immeasurable as we cannot foresee what will happen with a new software product that has not been tested in the DFAS configuration and environment.   The obvious risk would be a financial loss as we have invested over $90 million in the last five years in technology, purchases of hardware, software, maintenance, training, and the establishment of communities, applications and projects.  The support to our internal and external customers may cease as we may not be able to sustain performance at the current level and our customers may seek other means for interactive processing and sharing of data.  

Consequently, this acquisition is for the renewal of software licenses previously purchased, implemented, and currently being used by all DFAS users, is considered to be a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(2).

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

__ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.
(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
The items being offered must be mature commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  The source selection will be based on proposals that provide the best value to the Government.  Technical acceptability will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  To be technically acceptable, the offeror must receive a rating of pass in each of the minimum capability categories as described above (see 1 – 14).  If the product is not technically acceptable, no further proposal evaluation will be conducted.  

EVALUATION FACTORS

I.	Past Performance
a.	Quality
b.	Timeliness
c.	Business Professionalism
d.	Customer Satisfaction

II.  Experience
III. Price	
Factors to be evaluated are Past Performance, Experience and Price.  These elements are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance and Experience combined are more important than price.  Subfactors under the factor of Past Performance are:  Quality, Timeliness, Business Professionalism, and Customer Satisfaction.  The subfactors are equal in importance.  There are no subfactors under Experience and Price.  
Technical Proposals must include Descriptive Literature to include copies of Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Manuals for products being proposed, and product samples at no cost to the Government.   Any contractor providing samples is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.   Product Samples must be received at Lakehurst no later than 12 April 2007.  Products will be evaluated and compared to the minimum range of capabilities (See No. 1 – No. 14 above) to determine technical acceptability.   Matting samples will be returned in “as is” condition at the contractor’s request and expense.
For the factor of Experience, each proposal will be assigned a risk assessment rating.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.  Each offeror must identify actual design and assembly of Light Weight Matting to enable the Government to verify the offeror’s experience.  In making the determination of experience level, consideration will be given as to whether an offeror has experience in manufacturing matting of similar type and size.
For Past Performance, offerors must provide evidence of proven field usage, and names and phone numbers of recent customers, and prices to previous customers for mat that is identical or similar to those being proposed herein.   Offerors will complete Attachment 1 for three (3) contracts relevant to this procurement.  The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.   Unknown risk is a neutral rating, and will apply to offerors with no past performance in this commodity.  The Government may also consider past performance information that is available from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  
For Price, offerors are requested to separately price their matting and accessories by completing Section B.  Each required accessory (i.e. jack kits, stakes, etc.) should be priced separately.  In addition, offerors must include a commercial price list of their products and accessories with part numbers.  Each offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated using a quantity of 100 units for each of the five years for matting, and a quantity of 10 units for each of the five years for the accessories.   This quantity represents the most likely quantity to be ordered per year.    

GREATEST VALUE EVALUATION
The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror, conforming to the solicitation determined to represent the best value to the Government cost/price and other factors considered.  The offeror’s proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affect the evaluation factors for award.
Evaluation of an offeror’s proposal will be based on the information presented in the written proposal along with input obtained from outside sources relevant to past performance.  Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments may be deemed to be reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed factors or subfactors, may be used as a basis for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.  
The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance.  Each Factor will be evaluated and assigned a risk assessment rating.
The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
The items being offered must be mature commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  The source selection will be based on proposals that provide the best value to the Government.  Technical acceptability will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  To be technically acceptable, the offeror must receive a rating of pass in each of the minimum capability categories described above (see 1 – 14).  If the product is not technically acceptable, no further proposal evaluation will be conducted.

EVALUATION FACTORS

I.	Past Performance
a.	Quality
b.	Timeliness
c.	Business Professionalism
d.	Customer Satisfaction

II.  Experience
III. Price	
Factors to be evaluated are Past Performance, Experience and Price.  These elements are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance and Experience combined are more important than price.  Subfactors under the factor of Past Performance are:  Quality, Timeliness, Business Professionalism, and Customer Satisfaction.  The subfactors are equal in importance.  There are no subfactors under Experience and Price.  
Technical Proposals must include Descriptive Literature to include copies of Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Manuals for products being proposed, and product samples at no cost to the Government.   Contractor is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.   Product Samples must be received at Lakehurst no later than 24 April 2007.  Products will be evaluated and compared to the minimum range of capabilities (See No. 1 – No. 14 above) to determine technical acceptability.   Matting samples will be returned in “as is” condition at the contractor’s request and expense.
For the factor of Experience, each proposal will be assigned a risk assessment rating.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.  Each offeror must identify actual design and assembly of Extreme Light Weight Matting to enable the Government to verify the offeror’s experience.  In making the determination of experience level, consideration will be given as to whether an offeror has experience in manufacturing matting of similar type and size.
For Past Performance, offerors must provide evidence of proven field usage, and names and phone numbers of recent customers, and prices to previous customers for mat that is identical or similar to those being proposed herein.   Offerors will complete Attachment 1 for three (3) contracts relevant to this procurement.  The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.   Unknown risk is a neutral rating, and will apply to offerors with no past performance in this commodity.  The Government may also consider past performance information that is available from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  
For Price, offerors are requested to separately price their matting and accessories by completing Section B.  Each required accessory (i.e. jack kits, stakes, etc.) should be priced separately.  In addition, offerors must include a commercial price list of their products and accessories with part numbers.  Each offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated using a quantity of  500 units for each of the five years for matting, and a quantity of 10 units for each of the five years for the accessories.   This quantity represents the most likely quantity to be ordered per year.    

GREATEST VALUE EVALUATION
The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror, conforming to the solicitation determined to represent the best value to the Government cost/price and other factors considered.  The offeror’s proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affect the evaluation factors for award.
Evaluation of an offeror’s proposal will be based on the information presented in the written proposal along with input obtained from outside sources relevant to past performance.  Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments may be deemed to be reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed factors or subfactors, may be used as a basis for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.  
The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance.  Each Factor will be evaluated and assigned a risk assessment rating.
The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

Objectives for this BIM Solicitation:
?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services such as Fire, HVAC, Data/Communications, Security, and Lighting that may be utilized for building design, construction, and operation.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.
?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.
?	To create a 4D model to facilitate tenant phasing during construction.
?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in 1.1-1.3 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 

ITEMS PECULIAR TO ONE MANUFACTURER ? FAR 11.105(a)(1), Brand Name

1.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY

a.	Requiring Agency:  Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA)
b.	Contracting Agency:  CIFA Chief of Staff Acquisition (CIFA-CSA)

2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED

Annual maintenance for CIFA?s Planview Enterprise Project Portfolio Manager and Enterprise Portfolio Manager Software currently being used to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture (EA).

Installation and deployment of the software on CIFA?s secure network for production. 
Deployment Planning Services to enhance CIFA?s use of the tool for portfolio management and CIFA?s business processes.
 

3.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS/(INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE)

CIFA requires annual maintenance of the Planview portfolio management modules to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture. This software enables leadership to better analyze and manage risks, optimize investment opportunities and make informed investment decisions, align resources with business demands, and have visibility into and control of project portfolios. Installation of the software by the vendor will ensure that the software is connected and configured properly from a network and security perspective. The deployment planning services will support CIFA?s development of an implementation strategy for optimizing use of the tool based on CIFA?s business issues calling for a portfolio management solution. The estimated dollar value of the maintenance support is $17,909.00 and for the installation and deployment planning services, the estimated value is $9,672.00.

4.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

This acquisition of Planview is authorized by FAR 11.105(a), consistent with FAR 6.302-1, and documented per the requirements of FAR 11.105a(1).

5.	A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY

In accordance with FAR 11.105(a)(1), Planview software is required in order for CIFA technical experts to complete ongoing developmental activities; as Planview Portfolio Management modules are currently in use to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture. Therefore, it would not be in the best interest of the Government to procure a new software application in place of our currently installed Planview products. Planview?s software and services offerings are only available through Planview, the sole software developer. Similar applications were found to be lacking one or more of the particular required feature(s), did not meet, or could not be modified to meet CIFA?s requirements of form, fit, and function; nor at this time, could they be placed into CIFA?s infrastructure quickly and easily. Adding a new brand of software application into CIFA?s system would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs.

6.	A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE      

This requirement will be posted on the Fedbizopps website.  All interested parties can respond to the announcement.

7.	A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE    

The Contracting Officer will ensure that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable through price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404.


8.	A DESCRIPITION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULT OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 

Market research was conducted through GSA e-buy via RFQ223165; of five vendors only one vendor responded with pricing. The combined synopsis solicitation will be posted to Fedbizopps to encourage addition quotations.

9.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

CIFA CSA always attempts full and open competition whenever possible; and will continue to do so for future acquisition requirements.

10.	A LISTING OF THE SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS ACQUISITION     

Planview Inc.
DLT Solutions, Inc.

11.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITOIN 

CIFA-CSA has and continues to exercise competition as often as possible.  CIFA always uses a variety of vendors, manufacturers and sources to maximize competition.  CIFA will continue to practice surveying the market to ensure future full and open competition.

Solicitation W44DVQ71787701-1 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquis ition Circular 2005-05.  This acquisition is unrestricted under NAICS code 339112 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The requirements in this solicitation are:  CLIN 0001, 1 each INFINITI SYSTEM OZIL W/VIDEOVERLAY, FOOTSWITCH, AQUALASE  LIQUEFACTION DEVICE HAND PIECE AND 1 YEAR WARRANTY, PART#8065750265, and CLIN 0002, 1 each INFINITI ULTRASOUND HANDPIECE PART#8065750121.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal applies to this acquisition.  CLIN 0001 sal ient characteristics are: Alcon Infiniti" Vision System Catalog Number 8065750265 1.Fluid Management System.  The Infiniti employs pressure sensing for both irrigation and vacuum along with a more rigid fluid pathway.  This dramatically reduces the occlusion break response (at 500 mmHg the surge is less than half that of other units.  T he result is increased safety. 2.Ozil" Torsional Phaco. This technology provides oscillatory movement (32,000 Hz) allows for phaco with decreased repulsion of lens material and improves thermal safety while increasing the cutting efficiency even in the densest of cataracts.  3.Aqualase" Liquefaction. A lens removal modality which utilizes naturally balanced solution to safely remove the 2+ and less cataract.  It allows for safe and efficient removal while dramatically reduces the potential for capsule rupture.  4.Neosonix" Oscillations Phaco.  Neosonix Technology provides sonic cataract removal (100 Hz ).  Thus, enhances safe lens removal with less thermal energy and improving post operative results. 5. Hyper Pulse (100/second), Linear Burst, Fixed Pulse, all with Programmable On/Off Times.  Allows the surgeon various modalities for lens removal while reducing thermal risk and endothelium cell damage.   6. Tapered", Flared", Kelman", and MacKool", ABS® Tip Configurations. These tips provide wound burn protection, allow a more stable chamber, increased cutting power, and increased range of operation. 7. Global Linear Control.  Allows surgeon to have any combination of linear or fixed aspiration flow rate and vacuum. Provides custom control to the surgeon regardless of technique. 8. Dynamic Rise Time.  The time to maximize holding force is precisely regulated depending on the surgeons requirements.  For example, this allows the Infiniti to achieve 500 mmHg in the same amount of time that it takes the Legacy to reach 300 mmHg.  Thi s in turn results in less ultrasound and fluid used.  This equates to a more efficient procedure, and improved post-ops.  9. Surgical Video Overlay System.  This system accepts parameters from the Infiniti and overlays that information onto video coming from the microscope camera.  The combined video signal is can be recorded on a VCR.  This is an excellent teaching tool for the refinement of surgical technique. 10. Empty Bottle Detection.  Sensors allow for the detection of an empty BSS" bottle.  11. MicroSmooth" Ultra Coaxial Phaco.  Allows for a 2.2 incision which in turn allow for less induced astigmatism and less potential for wound leak. CLIN 0002 salient characteristics are:  The above cited item shall function and be compatible to the functional characteristics to the infiniti vision system. Vendors shall comply with FAR 52.211-6 if submitting other than the Brand Name product.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

<DESC>Response to Paint Booth Questions

1. This is not a paint booth. The air control unit will control the operation of the exhaust fans, the booth lights, and the heating system.

2. The dimensions of the paint booth are; 48 ft long x 48 ft wide x 18 ft tall.

3. The air control unit we wish to purchase will use sensors that are mounted in the filter wall that analyze the airflow and will adjust the fan speed of the three exhaust fans to maintain 100 cfm.  There is also a requirement for a control panel mounted in the hangar to turn the heaters on when needed.  If an OR EQUAL product is proposed it needs to meet the specifications of the Global Finishing Solutions Costa-Flow Air Balance System CF30-3.  

4. The system is a heated air system with two gas heaters.

5. We do require a VFD drive for the fan.

6. The unit will be mounted inside the hangar, but not inside the booth.

The contracting officer will make the final determination as to whether or not the or equal quoted product is a suitable substitution.

The Contractor shall provide the following items as specified as the requirement is Brand Name only.  The 112th Signal Battalion requires purchasing four (4) each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (shelter) model number AC1209L, four each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (remote) AC1209L-R and eight each fiber optic jumper cables J-Im4-TFOCA2-FC/APC.  The fiber modems are used to extend the RF capability in order to support Phoenix satellite terminals and baseband communications equipment for the Battalion. Currently the 112th are using two sets of these models for fiber modems to provide services in the CENTCOM AOR.  Four (4) more of these sets are needed and it is needed as well that they are compatible with the set presently in use in order for the Phoenix systems can be operated  remotely and TDMA signals sent without changing any protocols or dropping the shot.  This will also cause less down time to troubleshoot a component that is not compatible with our existing architecture.  The modems required must also meet the following specifications:

?	The RF path must have transmit and receive isolation on the link
?	The modem must have an Ethernet interface using a single fiber strand.
?	The modem set will need to be furnished with a 1000M 4 channel single mode fiber reel with TFOCA II ends.  This will also require a 2 ea TFOCA II fan-out per modem set (2 meters long) with FC ends on the fan-out ends.
?	The modem must have LED status indicators for both the optics side of the links as well as the RF and Ethernet side of the links.
?	The modem must have an LED status indicator for power state.
?	The modem must be matched to 75 Ohm impedance.
?	RF Link gain must be between -2dBm to +2dBm
?	Modem optical interfaces must be SM FC/APC
?	Modem RF interfaces must be N type
?	Ethernet interface must be 8x8 Rj45
?	Link will be modeled for 1--- meters
?	The input to the optical transmitter must be capable of withstanding signal levels of -40 to 0dBm(+10dBm as absolute maximum) (RF Uplink)
?	RF Downlink maximum RF input to fiber optic transmitter is less than 0dBm.
?	Modems must operate in temperatures of -30 Degrees C to 75 Degrees C.
?	Modems will be designed to fit in standard 19 inch rack mounts, with front and rear supports.

Along with the material support of acquiring the modems the 112th requires technical support in order to ensure that this equipment is compatible with our Phoenix Satellite Communications Systems:

Pre-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the installation location, 112th Signal Battalion, Fort Bragg, NC and meet with the 112th engineers to determine specific engineering and functionality requirements of the Fiber to RF modems.

The solution must have more than one secure data warehouse geographically separated, 3.  The solution must not employ foreign nationals, 4.  The solution must provide resiliency of service and data with respect to multiple telephone providers.  

Due to the fact that Envoy notification services are already in use at NGA, switching to a new notification service would not meet NGA's requirements of form, fit, and function, nor could NGA change over to a new notification solution quickly and easily.  It would be very costly to transition to a new notification system and such a transition would require a large amount of time to test the new system and to re-train our personnel to use the new system.  Such a transition would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Birch Bayh Courthouse Renovation/Addition
Building Type: Courthouse
Approximate Area: 548,769 s.f.
Year Built: 1905
Location:  Indianapolis, Indiana
Project Phase: The project is currently in the design phase (30% design), with construction scheduled to begin in 2009.
Description: The Birch Bayh Courthouse is a historic structure located in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed in 1905 to house the District Court, Post Office, and other Federal agencies, the building's interior showcases impressive, richly-ornamented finishes and features, including mosaic tile ceilings, cantilevered marble staircases, stained glass windows and decorative artwork and furnishings. The renovation will extend the life of the building. The building footprint is approximately 350 feet by 320 feet, and the total area is 548,769 SF. There are 5 stories (plus basement). 

OBJECTIVES

?	To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process. The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for (1) the documentation of existing conditions, and (2) the coordination of proposed building systems (under design) with the existing conditions as determined by (1). As-build drawings do not exist for some interstitial space for this building. The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs.

?	To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services
Imaging/Scan and Post Processing Plan

Registered Raw Data
The contractor shall submit registered raw data.  Such raw data may include point cloud data, calibrated photographs, satellite images, etc.  If 3D imaging technology is employed, the preferred format for this data is in ASCII: x, y, z, I, R, G, B (if intensity and color information are available). Other formats may be acceptable and are subject to approval by the GSA COTR. The registered point cloud data shall be reduced in size, to filter noise and redundant data to the maximum extent possible without compromising the accuracy and resolution of the model.  

2D Drawings of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall submit 2D representations of existing conditions (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) of the areas scanned using the registered raw data.  The government shall provide current drawings and specifications for each facility structure, if available, after GSA issues the Notice to Proceed. The 3D imaging information is expected to be used for verification and modification of existing 2D CAD drawings which will be provided by the GSA to the contractor.  

3D/BIM Model of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall model the existing condition of the facilities (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) for the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components listed below using either a 3D model and/or a BIM model.

Building Information Model of Proposed Design 
Contractor shall provide a BIM of the building interior and exterior based on Design Development documents and of the MEP system based on Engineering Design documents.  Proposed design documents will be provided by the GSA COTR.  

Design Coordination and Visualization Services
The contractor shall coordinate and identify any possible conflicts between existing (as-is) conditions and the proposed design solution, informing the design team of any current 2D errors or omissions.  

Quality Control Report


Site Visit
GSA will coordinate a building tour in the afternoon on 8/16/07.  Should the offeror like to participate in the building tour, further details can be obtained by emailing the contracting specialist.

Pre-Bid Conference 
The CO, GSA COTR, and regional teams will hold a pre-bid teleconference on 8/22/07 at 1pm EDT.  Contractors bidding on any portion of this solicitation will have the opportunity to gain clarifications on that day by calling the conference number: 888-790-6578 and using the passcode: BIM

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services
1.0	BASE SERVICES
The contractor shall provide an architectural and a structural BIM for both Phase III and Phase IV proposed design and assist GSA and its stakeholders in the visualization, communication, and simulation of the building.  
Architectural BIM
The contractor shall provide an architectural BIM that contains all significant architectural elements.  Building elements to be modeled include al

Program Information and Project Description

Program Information:
In July 2003, the Office the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has 10+ BIM pilot projects completed, 15+ projects underway, while assessing and supporting BIM applications in 35+ ongoing projects across the nation.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies.  One primary application area of this program includes the use of 3D imaging technology to augment and streamline the management of as-built spatial information (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description:

Project Name:  Birch Bayh Courthouse Renovation/Addition

Building Type: Courthouse

Approximate Area: 548,769 s.f.

Year Built: 1905

Location:  Indianapolis, Indiana

Project Phase: The project is currently in the design phase (30% design), with construction scheduled to begin in 2009.

Description: The Birch Bayh Courthouse (Appendix A) is a historic structure located in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed in 1905 to house the District Court, Post Office, and other Federal agencies, the building's interior showcases impressive, richly-ornamented finishes and features, including mosaic tile ceilings, cantilevered marble staircases, stained glass windows and decorative artwork and furnishings. The renovation will extend the life of the building. The building footprint is approximately 350 feet by 320 feet, and the total area is 548,769 SF. There are 5 stories (plus basement). 

The project will involve:
?	improvements to the heating, ventilation, and air condspace, are is only subject to the tolerance and accuracy noted in the original SOW.
Questions:
?	Are floor plans available? Not at this time due to security concerns.  Floor plans may be made available to the short listed contractors.  There is a sample floor plan in the SOW. 
?	Are there time restrictions or is there 24-hour access?  There are no time restrictions.  24-hour access is available.  Coordination with the designated point of contact through GSA is required. 
?	Will there be areas to be scanned where there is restricted access for building occupants?  Some.  Office areas will have people in it, and their activities may interfere with scanning activities.  Important to coordinate with GSA, who is here to assist and facilitate such coordination with the tenants and the Marshals.
?	Will the building maintenance staff be required to remove tiles, and are there Union issues with removing ceiling tiles? There are some delicate tiles, and the contractor can hire building maintenance staff to help with removal of the tiles if over two hours/day of work is required at a rate of $25-$27/hr.  Assistance less than two hours may be given at no charge.  These services are outside of scope of this SOW.
?	Do exterior walls need to be scanned?  Yes.
?	How much of the rooftop equipments is to be scanned? None.
?	Is the above 4th floor ceiling space safe to walk on?  Yes, but it is recommended that the contractor use 4?x5? sheets of plywood to distribute weight.
?	Is the 5th floor included in the scope?  The 5th floor is part of AOI 2B-interior spaces.  The project team is looking for the raw interior space due to proposed swing space needs for temporary judges chambers.
?	Will there be a problem setting up temporary targets in areas inside or outside of the building? No problem, as long as coordinated through the designated point of contact.
?	Is there scanning required inside the 3rd floor bulk head?  contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	Is there a demolition list?  We will provide a list with the awarded party, and this issue will be addressed in the scan and modeling plan.
?	In the existing floor plan is there in between floor/interstitial space as-builts?  No .
?	What are the requirements for ?preliminary findings? for section 3.6?  GSA will issue contractors with 2D drawings, GSA wants to be informed of significant conflicts between the BIM created for the proposed design and the existing 2D drawings. 
New Bern:
General:
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  
?	New Bern is 38000 ft2, while Birch Bayh is approximately 500,000 ft2.
Questions:
?	It states that there are 12 rooms per floor and 20 rooms per floor in the scope.  Which is it?  The building is closer to having 2 rooms per floor. 
?	For Option 2B, what deliverables are you looking for? Floor plans and ceiling plans? We are looking for floor plans at the required tolerance.  No reflected ceiling plans are required under this current request.
?	Is there any special security clearance required for non-US nationals?  Security clearance requirements vary widely from site to site.  There will need to be a background check or an escort.  For New Bern, a quick US Marshalls check will be required (approximately one week).  There is no need for a homeland security check since the contractor will not have free access.  Scanning/Imaging will need to take place during normal business hours.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services such as Fire, HVAC, Data/Communications, Security, and Lighting that may be utilized for building design, construction, and operation.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.
?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.
?	To create a 4D model to facilitate tenant phasing during construction.
?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications addressed in this project that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

Program Background and Project Description

Program Background:

In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has 10+ BIM pilot projects completed, 15+ projects underway, while assessing and supporting BIM applications in 35+ ongoing projects across the nation.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description: 

Project Name:  ?PH1B?  

Building Type: Federal Office Building

Location:  Washington D.C.

Approximate Area: 230,000 Gross s.f. (Phase 1B), approximately 1/5th of entire facility square footage

Year Built: 1960

Project Summary:
This project is an ongoing design and construction project involving the complete modernization of the PH1B building including: replacement of all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, communication, fire protection, and security systems; upgrading the exterior walls, windows, and structural system to resist blast and progressive collapse; and providing new shell and tenant spaces, finishes, and furnishings.  Phase 1B is the current phase of the project, and the phase for which the services listed below are requested.   The PH1B building is approximately 90% office space, and 10% conference space. The following quantities of room exist on each floor: Floor 1- 31 rooms, Floor 2- 63 rooms, Floor 3- 82 rooms, Floor 4- 125 rooms, Floor 5- 118 rooms, Floor 6- 93 Rooms, and Floor 7- 63 rooms.  The following timeline is the preliminary schedule for Phase 1B (subject to confirmation by GSA Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) after Notice to Proceed (NTP):

Phase:	Start	Finish
Pre-Design	Quarter 2, 2007	Quarter 4, 2007
Preliminary Concepts	Quarter 3, 2007	Quarter 1, 2008
Final Concepts	Quarter 1, 2008	Quarter 3, 2008
Design Development	Quarter 2, 2008	Quarter 3, 2008
Construction Documents	Quarter 3, 2008	Quarter 2, 2009
Construction	Quarter 3, 2009	Quarter 3, 2010

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desiring up with solutions.
?	Both projects have an Option for 4D Tenant Phasing: does this require modeling of existing conditions to be demolished as well as existing conditions to remain? PH1B- Yes.  Bolling- Yes. The focus is on the occupant agency.  High precision in building elements is not required.  There is very little construction sequencing (possibly on a very high level) that is part of this scope, just tenant phasing.
?	Both projects have an option for modeling object types for mechanical, electrical, etc. components. What is the level of graphic detail desired for these components? Can you provide an example? The graphic detail required is minimal.  The emphasis of this project is on the information the elements are populated with, not the graphic nature of the elements.  The purpose of this information is for building operations.
?	What will be the basis for the geometric model? Photographs? Catalogs? 2D technical drawings on paper? 2D CAD files? 3D CAD files? Other?  We will be sharing all the information we have with the contractor, and it can come from any one of these sources.
?	Do you want parametric objects? If so, how many parameters on average? (That is, length, width and height or parametric generation of model subcomponents?)  For the Options that refer to the population of the BIMs with performance requirements, there is a limit of 10 object attributes.  For as-built data, the limit is 15 object attributes.  This is stated in the current SOW.  We only listed examples on exactly which attributes were to be modeled, since this level of specificity will be determined in the BIM modeling plan once the winning bid is awarded.
?	Both projects have an Option for modeling and evaluating as-built equipment attributes: is there any other as-built data required?  No.
?	Would participation on these contracts conflict with participation in other CM or GC contracts for the same project?  The contractor would need to notify the GSA of other roles/responsibilities/contracts that they are affiliated with the same project.  This issue will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
?	What type of contract is this?  Firm-fixed price contract.
?	Can an academic research center apply for this contract? Yes,
?	Do the objects that need to be modeled have to be IFC 2x compliant?  To the greatest extent possible, yes.  All Option A elements must be. We encourage other equipment objects to be IFC compliant as well.
?	What OMNICLASS tables will you be using?  Likely to be Table 21 and Table 23 (to be confirmed during modeling plan phase).  There are ongoing efforts here to identify equipment with the correct OMNICLASS classification, and the contractor will be able to leverage that information.  The contractor will not have to determine all of that information from scratch.

PH1B:
Questions:

?	Are the Start/ Finish dates on p. 3 based on government fiscal year ? Quarter 1 2008 starts October 1 2007?  All quarters listed are based on the calendar year.  
?	Do Final Concepts and Design Development phases run concurrently as indicated? No.  Final Concepts will be completed before DD.  In February Final Concepts will start.  The end date will be around June, 2008. DD will last until March or April 2009. The contract length is based on the BIM contractor?s estimates of the time required to perform the work (see p.9), and are not expected to last through the duration of the actual design/construction time span.
?	When will the Concept Design Phase drawings be available? July, 2008.  We will most likely have a quasi-complete set of drawings before then, with which the contractor will be able to take them as the basis of the BIM scope.
?	Will the COBIE work take place during DD or during/after construction?  The work will primarily take place during the Construction Phase.  Some information may be available towards the end of the Construction Documents Phase.
?	Will an on-site verification of the as-builts be required?  Not required.
?	Will facility, wall, space, etc. attributes from Option A need to be put into COBIE? COBIE will be used primarily as an interface to exchange data on building equipment.  Location of the equipment may be addressed.  Details of the attributes to be modeling and how best use COBIE in that effort will be addressed in the BIM modeling Plan.
?	What CMMS system are you using?   Maximo for the Natioinal Capital Region/R11.  There is no standard GSA CMMS system across all GSA regions.
?	What level of coordination is required between the A/E and the BIM contractor?  The minimum requirement of coordination should be non-interruptive.  The minimum requirements reside in the SOW.  The contractor will report to the GSA team their findings, and the GSA and the A/E will use that information for conflict resolution.  
?	Are there other models to be incorporated into this model?  No.
?	What type of contracts does PH1B currently have?  An A/E and CM contract.
?	What are the highest priority systems to be modeled? Security is the highest priority.  HVAC and electrical are also high priority.  There is a desire to capture all the major elements of all the primary systems.  A comprehensive modeling of one particular system will not be required.  The maximum number of object types to be modeled are listed in the SOW.
?	What object types are to be modeled?  Some examples are listed in the SOW.  Finalized lists will be determined with the project team after the award has been determined.
?	How can we get information regarding the Base Services?  Please see GSA BIM Guide Series 02-Spatial Validation at www.gsa.gov/bim for the level of modeling detailed required.
?	Is it possible to visit the site prior to proposal submittal?  There may be a possibility for the short-listed group of contractors.

Bolling:

Questions:

?	Base Services require a ?3D Model and/or BIM of the surrounding landscape, buildings, and streetscape? ? how many blocks in each direction? One block in each direction from the subject building.
?	Option C ? Energy Modeling requires energy simulations of the ?impacts of a number of discrete building material alternatives, building envelope configurations, and HVAC equipment or operational design options (based on the design proposal and inputs by the design team)? ? how many sets of alternatives to you expect to simulate? The modeling that is required is to model the proposed design and compare it to the existing design.  No ?design options? will be evaluated.  The simulation is meant to serve as a validation of the A/E?s energy modeling.
?	What types of contract are currently in place?  A/E, CA, and CM, and GC.
?	Is it expected that the contractor do LEED certification? No.
?	Is there a particular energy simulation application you want the contractor to use?  This is to be recommended by the contractor in the modeling plan, subject to GSA COTR?s approval.  Possible applications include ones that use a DOE-2 engine (VisualDOE, eQUEST), EnergyPlus, or an application capable of leveraging the spatial data of BIM such as Riuska or IES.

Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO


08/23/07 PH1B and Bolling Pre-Bid Conference
Meeting Minutes
General (some general questions were from 8/22 telecon but are valid for these 2 projects as well):
?	Is there a NTP date in mind? 	September-October.
?	Can we bid on one of all projects?  Yes.  Is there full and open competition? Yes.  There are few contract clauses due to this being a commercial acquisition.  
?	What is the order of importance of evaluation factors? The order of importance is the order they are listed in.  Weighting parameters will not be provided.
?	What liability concerns are there regarding third parties?  Once a Deliverable is accepted by the Government, it is considered Government property.  If Government property is provided to a third party, that is the responsibility of the government.
?	Will a list of participants on the phone call be made available to bidders?  No.
?	What is the difference between the existing and proposed condition modeling requirements?  We want to capture the exact conditions for the existing conditions, including any deformations.  These may be modeled using mesh, surface models, or BIM.  For the proposed conditions modeling, a BIM must be created. 
?	Can a firm submit just existing conditions plan or does the GSA want the proposed design with it?  GSA is open to both, but would prefer prices for all options listed.
?	Are constructions costs available?  No, we don?t provide budgets.
?	Additional Options will not be added at this time.  Option additions/modifications may be negotiated with the winning contractor. 
?	Contractors may submit bid proposals up until Sept. 4th at midnight.  Email the proposal to Steven Cox at steven.cox@gsa.gov
?	Does GSA require that the contractor propose on every option in the solicitation?  We don?t require it, though we do require the base option be priced.  Though not required, pricing on all or most of the Options listed is preferred.
?	All services listed include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series. What is the ?support? desired from the contractor? Is there a Best Practices deliverable(s)? Should the contractor provide periodic ?lessons learned? reports or draft a best practices document?  Should the contractor plan to attend one or more best practices workshops or meetings?  Will experience with defining and documenting best practices be an evaluation criterion?  These solicitations are project-specific.  The contractor will be working with the GSA national office and informing us of the lessons learned during the process.  There is no requirement to assist us in drafting related BIM Guides, which will be undertaken by GSA?s program-related contracts and consultants.
?	Could you indicate the number or frequency of face-to-face contacts desired with the contractor? We identified the minimum requirements in the SOW.  We will be supplying the design information to the contractor.  The contractor will report directly to the GSA.  Most communication can take place virtually.  GSA encourages and invites the contractor to be an active part of the coordination with the project team, though this is above the minimum requirements.
?	In what format(s) will the GSA provide drawings: paper, PDF, DWG, other?  For PH1B there will be CAD drawings and paper drawings.  All new work will be CAD supplied.  For Bolling, CAD or Oracle database formats can be provided.  DWGs and paper plans are available.
?	Is there any expectation that the contractor will need to perform field measurements or field verification of conditions in order to create the BIM? No.  The minimum expectation is that the contractor takes the 2D data and convert it to 3D.
?	What is the contractor?s role in resolving any clashes between various disciplines? None, they shall only inform GSA of potential conflicts, then GSA and its design team will be responsible for coming up with solutions.
?	Both projects have an Option for 4D Tenant Phasing: does this require modeling of existing conditions to be demolished as well as existing conditions to remain? PH1B- Yes.  Bolling- Yes.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  New Bern Courthouse/Post Office/Customs House Renovation/Addition
Building Type: Courthouse
Approximate Area: 38,000 s.f.
Year Built:  1700?s (~300 years ago)
Location:  New Bern, North Carolina
Project Phase: The project is currently in Conceptual Design (CD).  CD will last approximately through October, 2007, and Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CD) will last through November, 2008.
Description: 
The U.S. Courthouse/Post Office/Customs House (Appendix A) is a historic structure located in New Bern, North Carolina. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building footprint is approximately 100 feet by 70 feet, and the total area is 38,000 SF. There are 3 stories (plus basement), with approximately 12 rooms per floor.

OBJECTIVES

?	To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process. The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for (1) the validation of existing ?as-built? data, and (2) the coordination of proposed building systems (under design) with the existing condition as validated by (1). The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs. 

?	To generate a point cloud of the building interior and exterior for applications such as archival, visualization, and site planning.

?	To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services
1.0	BASE SERVICES
The contractor shall provide an architectural and a structural BIM for both Phase III and Phase IV proposed design and assist GSA and its stakeholders in the visualization, communication, and simulation of the building.  
Architectural BIM
The contractor shall provide an architectural BIM that contains all significant architectural elements.  Building elements to be modeled include all exteriooriginal SOW.
Questions:
?	Are floor plans available? Not at this time due to security concerns.  Floor plans may be made available to the short listed contractors.  There is a sample floor plan in the SOW. 
?	Are there time restrictions or is there 24-hour access?  There are no time restrictions.  24-hour access is available.  Coordination with the designated point of contact through GSA is required. 
?	Will there be areas to be scanned where there is restricted access for building occupants?  Some.  Office areas will have people in it, and their activities may interfere with scanning activities.  Important to coordinate with GSA, who is here to assist and facilitate such coordination with the tenants and the Marshals.
?	Will the building maintenance staff be required to remove tiles, and are there Union issues with removing ceiling tiles? There are some delicate tiles, and the contractor can hire building maintenance staff to help with removal of the tiles if over two hours/day of work is required at a rate of $25-$27/hr.  Assistance less than two hours may be given at no charge.  These services are outside of scope of this SOW.
?	Do exterior walls need to be scanned?  Yes.
?	How much of the rooftop equipments is to be scanned? None.
?	Is the above 4th floor ceiling space safe to walk on?  Yes, but it is recommended that the contractor use 4?x5? sheets of plywood to distribute weight.
?	Is the 5th floor included in the scope?  The 5th floor is part of AOI 2B-interior spaces.  The project team is looking for the raw interior space due to proposed swing space needs for temporary judges chambers.
?	Will there be a problem setting up temporary targets in areas inside or outside of the building? No problem, as long as coordinated through the designated point of contact.
?	Is there scanning required inside the 3rd floor bulk head?  contractors can omit Option J that corresponds to AOI 3B.  GSA will not exercise the option to scan the bulkhead located on the third floor corridor.
?	Is there a demolition list?  We will provide a list with the awarded party, and this issue will be addressed in the scan and modeling plan.
?	In the existing floor plan is there in between floor/interstitial space as-builts?  No .
?	What are the requirements for ?preliminary findings? for section 3.6?  GSA will issue contractors with 2D drawings, GSA wants to be informed of significant conflicts between the BIM created for the proposed design and the existing 2D drawings. 
New Bern:
General:
?	There will be a site visit on Tuesday August 28th, 11am local (eastern daylight) time.  Meet in the first floor lobby.  
?	New Bern is 38000 ft2, while Birch Bayh is approximately 500,000 ft2.
Questions:
?	It states that there are 12 rooms per floor and 20 rooms per floor in the scope.  Which is it?  The building is closer to having 2 rooms per floor. 
?	For Option 2B, what deliverables are you looking for? Floor plans and ceiling plans? We are looking for floor plans at the required tolerance.  No reflected ceiling plans are required under this current request.
?	Is there any special security clearance required for non-US nationals?  Security clearance requirements vary widely from site to site.  There will need to be a background check or an escort.  For New Bern, a quick US Marshalls check will be required (approximately one week).  There is no need for a homeland security check since the contractor will not have free access.  Scanning/Imaging will need to take place during normal business hours.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is RFQ70079 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.    Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.

Conduct a careful administrative review of applications; check format and content of applications, review personnel and consultant lists and letters of collaboration to determine areas of potential conflicts of interest.

Ensure timely preparation and release of high-quality summary statements by preparing drafts of the written summary statements and editing as necessary, for review, revision, and approval by the DFO/SRA.

Over the next year the Office of Extramural Affairs, NIDA, is scheduled to face an expanded workload of RFAs, other special reviews, in addition to managing reviews in standing review committees.  It will not be possible for the current levels of staffing to carry out these tasks.

Following review meetings, contract staff will be given compiled sets of reviewers' raw critiques and a copy of any available OEA staff handwritten notes from the discussion of each application.  Using these materials, the contract staff person will prepare recommendations for possible modifications to reviewer critiques and suggested text for a Resume and Summary of reviewers' critiques and discussion, as well as text for brief paragraphs that may be required for summary statement sections on animal/human subjects and minority/gender/children inclusion.  These sections should explain concerns or comments expressed in reviewers' critiques and discussions at meetings.  The contract staff will also read and edit reviewers? critiques for grammatical, typographical, and other errors that interfere with clarity and communication.  OEA staff will review the drafts and OEA staff will finalize the summary statements after the contract staff has completed their work.  OEA staff will conduct all functions that are inherently governmental functions.

Privacy Act Requirements:  The contractor will not disclose any information contained in the grant applications or reviews or discussions at review committee meetings to anyone not directly connected with the grant review process and must protect the contents of the applications.

Period of performance is 12 months with approximately 32 hours per week.  The vendor may be required to perform services in Bethesda, Maryland.
