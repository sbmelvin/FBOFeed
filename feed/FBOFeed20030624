<ARCHDATE>06232004
<CONTACT>Steve Rolph Water Resources Program Specia 5095755848286  srolph@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with California Polytechnic State University - Irrigation Research and Training Center (ITRC) The proposed action is to assist The Upper Columbia Area Office (UCA), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR/Reclamation), Department of the Interior in the  technical transfer investigation research services to assist in conducting a benchmarking of flexibility and needs investigation of USBR Pacific Northwest Region-UCA irrigation districts. Benchmarking ? refers to a systematic process for securing continual improvement through comparison with relevant and achievable internal or external norms and standards.  The overall aim of benchmarking is to improve the performance of an organization, as measured against its mission and objectives.  Benchmarking implies comparison ? either internally with previous performance and desired future targets, or externally against similar organizations, or organizations performing similar functions.  Benchmarking is in use in both the public and private sectors. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE: 1. The objective of this contract is to provide specific technical transfer research services to assist  Reclamation?s Upper Columbia Area Office in conducting a benchmarking of flexibility and needs investigation of USBR Pacific Northwest Region-UCA irrigation districts. 2. Pursuant to this objective, the contractor shall apply benchmarking procedures to UCA irrigation districts for the following goals:evaluate their present status, compare their status against similar irrigation districts,determine what level of water delivery service various irrigation districts provide to customers, determine what constraints exist to providing better water delivery service,document a variety of conditions such as prices for water, acre-feet of water per acre, energy usage, etc. Learn what actions irrigation district personnel believe will enhance their daily operation,learn what investments the irrigation districts are planning to make within the next 5 years,define the needs of irrigation districts, and thereby define what technical assistance role USBR-UCA should take to assist the irrigation districts with achieving their goals of being good stewards of water and energy ? both during conveyance of water in by providing good service to the farmer customers. Obtain convincing arguments that can be used to develop modernization plans with an irrigation district. ? Almost invariably, other districts have successfully implemented some of the measures that are discussed.  The benchmarking allows the USBR to know where those measures or practices are applied, and by sharing that information with the district, the district personnel become more comfortable with attempting some new practice. 3. The following tasks will be performed (Technical Requirements and Deliverables): The Contractor will interview irrigation district personnel from approximately 40 agricultural irrigation districts within the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation?s Pacific Northwest Region ? Upper Columbia Area.  Data will be analyzed to determine the degree of water delivery service provided to farmers and the extent of existing and planned district modernization.  The interview process will help identify and define needs for direct technical assistance and training.  These needs varied by district and area in the western U.S.  Direct technical assistance to individual districts has been and will continue to be a key element of continuing success in modernization. 4. Additional Technical Requirements and Deliverables: Phase 1: UCA-Wide Districts Task 1 - Develop standard format for the district evaluation Contractor will utilize its basic ?rating? scales for various internal performance indicators that it used in previous benchmarking of irrigation district investigations.  Additional questions will be customized for particular UCA- WCFSP needs.  Benchmarking methodology used in this project must have been utilized by the Contractor in previous benchmarking investigations of irrigation districts conducted by the Contractor. Task 2 - Make list of districts and initial contact A list of key districts will be provided to the Contractor by USBR-UCA.  The Contractor will contact these districts (approximately 40) by letter explaining the purpose of the survey, and include a questionnaire.  The letter will be followed up by a phone call.  At this time, a preliminary schedule of visits will be developed.  District personnel will be asked to fill out certain portions of the survey form in advance.  It is estimated that about 50% of the districts will probably follow through with the pre-visit work. Task 3 - Perform site visit and survey districts A Contractor employee will personally visit all districts and complete the survey.  Many of the questions cannot be answered by the district personnel. Answers must be determined through a variety of questions posed by the Contractor. Task 4 - Write report and disseminate results The data will be organized, grouped, and statistically analyzed. The conclusions will be developed. A final report will be written. The final report will be sent digitally (Adobe .pdf file format) and hard copy to USBR-UCA, plus to each participating district. Phase 2:  Single District Task 1 - Perform detailed evaluation of one district (Yakima Project - Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District) The purpose of Task 1 will be to evaluate and report on the accuracy of the measurement of irrigation water volumes delivered to Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District (SVID).  Discrepancies have been reported between USBR current meter readings, as compared to data from a new broadcrested weir (a.k.a. ?Replogle Flume?) downstream of the fish screen, at the entrance to SVID?s main canal.  An independent assessment of the accuracy of flow rate measurements and the conversion to volumes delivered will be provided by the Contractor.  The hardware and procedures for both the current meter readings and the flume will be evaluated.  Some of the factors to be considered include:Flume: while the main canal is operating: resolution of water levels sensors, resolution of the A/D conversion and archiving of data, frequency of data collection, accuracy of calibration of the water level sensor, inherent accuracy of the water level sensor, downstream water levels at various flow rates (high and low), existence of entrance condition problems, as evidenced by visual non-symmetric flow paths as well as current meter data, and correct location of the stilling well. Technique for computation of volume delivered (e.g. ? is it based on the target flow, or actual measured flow?) Note:  If it is based on the target flow, then the mechanics and control of the gate at the headworks need to be examined.  If it is based on actual measured flows over the flume, an examination of the gate control algorithm is not necessary. When the canal is empty: Possible existence of rough concrete or rubble in front of the flume, existence of unusual entrance canal cross section changes upstream of the flume, entrance design for the stilling well, comparison of ?as built? dimensions against ?design? drawings, and examination of the flume roughness. Current Metering ? Everything will be done while the canal is operating, correctness of depth of current meter measurement, correctness of cross section measurements, density of flow measurements (horizontal and vertical) Conditions (flow, time of day, time relative to changing target depths) of current metering, equipment used, and frequency of and procedures for converting flow rates to volumes.To conduct this evaluation, the contractor will be provided the following data/information in advance of visiting SVID: >From USBR-UCA: 	Winflume design file 	Records of current metering activity: Copies of the field data sheets for the past 2 years, computations and formulas for volumes delivered for the past 2 years, procedures that have been used to shift the flow rating curves. >From SVID: 	Any construction /design drawings for the flume, if available. 	Any ?as built? dimensions for the flume, if available. 	Any specifications on hardware associated with flow measurement: Water level sensor, stilling well design, datalogger or PLC that converts the sensor signal, example calculations or spreadsheet used to compute volumes from flows, and data for the past 2 years ? flows and volumes Task 2 ? Write Report and disseminate results The data will be organized, grouped, and statistically analyzed. The conclusions will be developed. A final report will be written. The final report will be sent digitally (Adobe .pdf file format) and hard copy to USBR-UCA, plus to SVID.  Water measurement is a critical indicator measure used in performance based benchmarking.  Detail data collected in Phase 2 will be integrated into the analysis tasks (Task 4 ? Phase 1) in the benchmarking investigation. The proposed contractor's unique qualifications are as follows: Cal Poly ITRC is an  accredited research institute with experience in conducting and publishing benchmarking of flexibility and needs investigations with irrigation districts. Through its five year Master cooperative agreement (1425-8?FC-10-04220) with the USBR-UCA, ITRC has accumulated extensive experience in providing technical assistance to virtually every  Federal Reclamation irrigation district located within the Upper Columbia Area.  They are uniquely qualified in conducting such an investigation: Provided over 880 staff days of technical assistance services to UCA irrigation districts. Through many years of conducting on-site district-wide Rapid Appraisal Process (RAP) and other types of field visits, ITRC possesses an extensive field-based understanding of the UCA irrigation districts facilities, operations, personnel and water management issues unique to no other research organization.Gained the trust and confidence of the UCA irrigation districts.  This is critical in acquiring information that may be considered sensitive by the districts.  The knowledge and trust of the districts earned by ITRC, uniquely qualifies ITRC to rapidly compile the information and develop an investigation report within a very short deadline.  In addition to irrigation districts, ITRC has developed a strong trusting relationship with the USBR in four Regions and 10 Area Offices.  They have functioned as a neutral technical referee involving issues between irrigation districts and State and Federal agencies. Experienced in conducting large scale irrigation district benchmarking investigations.  One investigation (Benchmarking of Flexibility and Needs 2000) covered 60 agricultural irrigation districts representing 91% of the irrigated acreage within the USBR Mid-Pacific Region.  The second investigation (Benchmarking of Flexibility and Needs 2002) covered 17 non-Federal agricultural irrigation districts (1,760,000 irrigated acres) in California.  ITRC introduced benchmarking of flexibility and needs methodology first to the U.S. irrigation districts and recently through the United Nations ? Food & Agricultural Organization to irrigation projects world-wide.  With approximately 40 irrigation districts irrigating 1,200,000 acres, UCA irrigation projects should pose no challenge to ITRC. Developed unique Flexibility Indices and other benchmarking methodologies.  ITRC initiates its benchmarking investigations by conducting a 200 question survey conducted with each irrigation district.  Through a unique set of internal performance indicators an analysis is made to determine the extent of flexibility for the districts and projects. Provided water measurement technical assistance to Yakima Project irrigation districts and projects Flow measurement instrumentation includes Acoustic Doppler (Roza I.D., Bull Canal, Kittitas R.D., Wapato Irrigation Project), ultrasonic level sensor (Yakima-Tieton I.D.), flow meters (Selah Moxee I.D.) and ramp flumes (Roza I.D.). The immediate objective is to get the benchmarking investigation initiated as soon as possible to obligate Water Conservation Field Services Program funds earmarked for this project.  There is an immediate need to initiate Phase 2 -Task 1 (SVID Water Measurement) within the next few weeks.  It is critical that the high water mark level downstream of the ramp flume must be accurately surveyed at peak flow (end of June ? early July).  The Benchmarking of Flexibility and Needs investigation was originally set up over six months ago as a task under the Cooperative Agreement.  The goal is to have the benchmarking investigation completed by September 30, 2003.  ITRC?s extensive working experience with Upper Columbia Area irrigation districts and with Reclamation, coupled with the organization?s unique qualifications of conducting numerous large-scale, multi-district benchmarking investigations will require minimal start-up time and allow the delivery date to be met.  After an exhaustive search of other accredited research organizations that work with irrigation districts, none of them had any experience in conducting and publishing benchmarking investigations.  None of them have developed any benchmarking methodology similar or equivalent to ITRC?s.   The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business July, 10, 2003 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<CONTACT>Steve Rolph Water Resources Program Specia 5095755848286  srolph@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>NA The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Okanogan County. The proposed action is to assist The Upper Columbia Area Office (UCA), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR/Reclamation), Department of the Interior as it participates in developing a detailed Methow Basin Water Management Plan (Methow Plan) for the Methow Subbasin.  The purpose of this Contract is to provide information necessary for the management of the Methow River subbasin.  Reclamation has been directed under the BiOp to work on instream flow issues in the Methow subbasin and Okanogan County is involved with the Methow Watershed Planning Unit (MWPU) in the development of a watershed plan for the Methow subbasin.  The watershed plan is being development as part of the Washington State watershed planning process (HB 2514) and as part of that process instream flow management recommendation will be made to the Washington Department of Ecology.  This project will allow for the development of sound instream flow management recommendations for use by both Reclamation and the MWPU. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a Biological Opinion (BiOP) in December, 2000 on continued operations and configuration of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS).  As part of the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPAs) to avoid jeopardy,  NMFS identified a need to improve migration, spawning and rearing habitat in priority subbasins as part of an off-site mitigation program (RPA No. 149).  In part to address that need NMFS required  that  BOR shall initiate programs in three priority subbasins identified in the Basin wide Recovery Strategy per year over 5 years. The priority subbasins in the upper Columbia River area, established by NMFS, are the Methow, Entiat, and Wenatchee.  These subbasins provide important spawning and rearing habitat for listed spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus).  This contract will provide information useful in implementing Reclamation's requirements under the BiOp. The objectives of this contract are to provide data for: developing instream flow management recommendations as part of the watershed planning process for the  Methow subbasin, characterization of hydrologic conditions to support Reclamation's participation in instream flow management planning and endangered species recovery actions, the Methow Subbasin Monitoring Project that is currently being implemented as part of Reclamation's RPA 183 action,  effectiveness monitoring for instream structures designed by Reclamation, designing instream structures as part of the RPA 149 program, evaluating the benefits of possible instream flow acquisitions under RPA 149, identifying, prioritizing, and monitoring salmonid recovery actions in the subbasin.  The Methow Subbasin provides habitat for anadromous and resident fish, including species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and are also used a source of water for irrigated agriculture. The information provided by this contract can be used to better identify instream flow needs in the subbasin.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey, Water Resources Discipline has a requirement for the drilling of four (4) monitoring wells in the vicinity of Kihei, Maui.  Three of the locations are close to the shoreline adjacent to South Kihei Road on land owned by Maui County.  A fourth site is located on State of Hawaii Department of Transportation land along Piilani Hwy.  A bid for the contract should include the Contractor's price for mobilization and demobilization to and from the area, costs to move between sites, and the costs to drill and construct each well, including all labor and materials.  The Contractor is responsible for obtaining at his own cost any and all necessary permits, licenses, permissions, and fees, which may be required by law to perform the work.  The Contractor is also responsible for working with the landowner to arrange access to the sites as well as obtaining a Right-of-Entry.  The Contractor is further responsible for adhering to all requirements imposed by the landowner regarding safety, damages, working conditions, and liability.  Geologic conditions consist of volcanic basalt, possibly overlain by some sedimentary coastal alluvium and reef material.  If drilling fluids are required, they should consist of air, water, and foam.  Drilling mud will not be used.  The Contractor shall provide a complete drilling unit with all necessary cranes, hoists, tools, accessories, water, power, lighting, bits, well casing, gravel, and all other equipment and materials.  The drilling unit and compressor must be in good working condition and of such capacity to drill to a depth of 200 feet (61 m) below the water table.  The contractor must also employ knowledgeable and experienced personnel to do this work, and be responsible for their performance and conduct.  The Contractor must supply all casing, well covers, cement, gravel, and water for the work.  Because the work will be near roads and recreational beaches, suitable mufflers or noise abatement may be required to comply with local regulations.  Control of noise, dust, water, and fluids from the drilling are the responsibility of the contractor, and must meet all local regulations.  The Contractor is also responsible for controlling access to the immediate work site and ensuring the safety of all bystanders and other people.  The Contractor is further responsible for clean up and any site restoration or property damages incurred during this work. The Government will furnish locks and Survey markers that must be installed by the Contractor upon completion of well construction at each site.  Each well at Sites A, B, and C should be approximately 110 feet (33.5 m) deep, so that the well penetrates 100 feet (30.5 m) into the water table.  The well must have solid casing from the top of the well to the water table, and open casing from the water table to the bottom of the well.  The well at Site D should be approximately 260 feet (79 m) deep, so that the well penetrates 200 feet (61 m) into the water table.  The well must have solid casing from the top of the well to the water table, and open casing from the water table to the bottom of the well.  All wells must be completed with nominal 2-inch (5.1-cm) diameter PVC casing.  Casing lengths must be screwed together or of the Certa-Lok type (which uses a spline to couple the sections).  Glue and solvents must not be used.  Open sections of the casing must have a slot size of 0.02 inches (0.5 mm) or similar.  The annulus outside of the open section must have a minimum of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) diameter of gravel packing around the slots.  Clean silica sand must be used for the gravel packing.  Solid sections of each well must have a minimum of 2 inches (5.1 cm) of grout seal around the casing.  Wells must be completed with a cement pad that is 4 inches (10.1 cm) deep.  The Contractor must provide a non-rusting protective cover with a secure locking cap.  The wells must be finished at-grade and secured with a flush-mounted cover to provide access for sampling and measurement equipment.  The completion date for this project is September 30, 2003.  The Invitation for Bid is anticipated to be issued July 10, 2003 and the bid opening date is anticipated to be August 10, 2003.  This construction project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000.

This procurement is conducted under simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14.  RFP 246-03-00342 should be referenced on all bids. The applicable NAICS code is 561410 with a size standard of $6 million.  This procurement is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The VA Medical Center, 1970 Roanoke Blvd., Salem, Virginia 24153 and the VA Medical Center, 1100 Tunnel Road, Asheville, North Carolina 28805 have a requirement for Transcription Services.    This procurement is to obtain the services of off-site dictation and medical transcription services, for the period September 1, 2003 up to and including August 31, 2004 with four (4) available one (1) year option renewal periods. Transcription services shall be provided seven days a week, 24 hours a day, within prescribed turn-around-times (=93TAT=94).  Contractor shall transcribe reports utilizing headers and footers and appropriate formats.  Contractor shall also transmit and/or upload completed reports to VA using transmission and batch protocols provided by VA. The dictated material includes highly technical medical terminology, and requires a comprehensive (minimum of three years) knowledge of specialized vocabularies.  Specialized vocabularies shall encompass a variety of subjects in the field of medicine and surgery to include, but are not limited to: ambulatory care, anesthesiology, cardiology, dermatology, dentistry, drug and alcohol treatment, endocrinology, general medicine, gastroenterology, general surgery, geriatrics, gynecology, hematology immunology, internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, nuclear medicine, oncology, ophthalmology, oral surgery, orthopedics, otolaryngology, otorhinolaryngology, vascular, pathology, psychiatry, psychology, plastic surgery, pulmonary, renal, radiology, rheumatology, spinal cord injury, thoracic surgery, transplant, and urology.=20 Material is dictated by a variety of clinical staff and requires adaptation to variations in accents, speech, tone, voice volume, delivery, pronunciation, and enunciation.  The dictated material includes, but is not limited to the following: discharge summaries, operative and non-operative (cardiac catheterization, endoscopy, dermatology)  reports, medical history and physical exam reports, radiology reports, emergency department notes, compensation and pension examination reports, transfer summaries, outpatient and inpatient progress notes, cardiology reports (Holter monitors, echocardiograms, stress treadmills), neurology reports (EEG, EMG, Dopplers), surgical pathology reports, cytology reports, autopsy reports, mental status examinations, Persian Gulf examinations, Agent Orange examinations, procedure notes, consultations, miscellaneous medical and other administrative reports. System:  The Salem and Asheville VAMC=92s have their own dictation equipment, Dictaphone Enterprise Express System.=20 The transcribed documents are either typed directly into the VAMC=92s Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) system or are typed and uploaded into the VISTA system.  Contractor capability to perform both functions is necessary. Contractor must be able to dial into the system, transmit transcribed documents, monitor jobs in the dictation system database and produce management reports from the database. Equipment necessary to comply with the terms of this contract is the responsibility of the Contractor.  Contractor must use communications software that is compatible with the VAMC=92S VISTA system.  The Contractor shall connect to the VAMC=92s system utilizing a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN).  The VA shall provide the license for the VPN.  Note:  Currently, there is no cost to the Contractor for a VPN license, but this may be subject to change.  Contractor shall pay for connect/toll charges for dialing any and all VA-provided telephone numbers.  Adequate power and connections will be maintained by the Contractor to provide uninterrupted service.  Any equipment, material, or services required in the performance of this contract (i.e. dialing toll charges, site visit(s) to the VAMC=92s for training the Contractor, background investigations, etc.) shall be included in the price of the line items. Line Count:  A Character Gross Line shall consist of a maximum of sixty-five (65) characters in length, with margins set for (65) maximum characters per visual line.  Font will be Courier New 11 Point.  Any line with typed text is counted as a billable line.  No charges are assessed for blank lines (a line containing no text). There will be no bolding or underlining of words in transcribed reports due to incompatibility with VISTA.  Transcription is completed in Microsoft Word.  (Specifically, Dictaphone=92s EX TEST database).  Site must be configured with the following line counting options enabled, unless otherwise specified in the contract or elsewhere in this section: Include Headers and Footers; Include Template; Include Tokens; Adjust character count to include spaces between words.  For billing purposes, lines are calculated by adding the number of characters in a report and dividing by 65. Header text is non-printable and non-billable characters. Not all characters in a report are countable for line counting and billing purposes.  Only those characters in a report following the header up to and including the footer are countable for line counting and billing purposes.  None of the text/characters in the header of a transcribed report shall be counted for line counting or billing purposes.  The header includes all text/characters including and between $HDR and $TXT.  The Contractor shall not bill the VA for any other typed characters - this includes but is not limited to transcriptionist comments, logs, TAT reports, e-mails or correspondence to the VA, and/or any typing required to upload patient reports into the patient=92s electronic medical record.  The VA shall be responsible for payment of lines received rather than lines transmitted.  TAT (Turn-Around-Time): The VA's Dictaphone system shall allow the Contractor to immediately access jobs through a pool assignment as soon as they are dictated.  TAT is the difference in time between the time the author hangs up at the conclusion of dictating into the Dictaphone system, and the time the Contractor's completed transcribed report is uploaded (regardless of upload methodology) into the correct patient electronic record in VISTA/CPRS.  When the author hangs up at the completion of a dictation, the dictation system shall record the date and time that the dictation was completed/closed.  The system shall also record the date and time the transcription of that report was completed.  However, it must clearly be understood that the date and time that transcription was completed has absolutely no bearing on the overall TAT.  It is not until the date and time that the transcription is uploaded into the correct patient=92s electronic record that the TAT can be calculated.  Turnaround Times:  History and Physicals 4 hours; Emergency Room Notes 4 hours; Transfer and Interim Summaries 4 hours; Stat Radiology reports 2 hours; Other STAT dictation=092 hours; Compensation and Pension Exam 24 hours; Discharge Summaries 24 hours; Progress notes 24 hours; Operative Reports 24 hours; Procedure Reports 24 hours; Radiology Reports 24 hours; Other non-stat dictation 24 hours. Note: TAT is calculated on a 24-hour basis, including weekends and holidays.

The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer with their proposal a Certificate of Insurance which shall contain an endorsement to the effect that cancellation of, or any material change in the policies which adversely affect the interests of the Government in such insurance shall not be effective unless a 30-day written notice of cancellation or change is furnished to the Contracting Officer.=20 Provisions and clauses found at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications =96Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items;  52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items apply to this RFP.

Accessories:   (*)  Regulator Model 7036 Stainless Steel:  The regulator protects the pump from pressure extremes associated with obstructions in the discharge line, while maintaining the established system pressure.  When no flow is required by the system, the regulator bypasses all the system flow. (*)  Pulsation Dampener Model 6014 Stainless Steel:  The pulsation dampener minimizes wear to down stream components caused by pulsation.  The pulsation dampener is precharges with dry nitrogen to 50% of the system pressure. (*)  Pressure Gauge Model 6097 Stainless Steel:  The pressure gauge is glycerin filled for consistent, accurate readings. A built in snubber reduces pressure fluctuations. (*)  Relief Valve Model 7036 Stainless Steel:  The relief valve provides back up protection to assure complete pressure relief for maximum system protection. The relief valve is set approximately 300 psi over operating system pressure. ( )  Inlet Strainer Model:  The inlet strainer protects the pump from any particles entering the pump.  The strainer has stainless steel reinforced ports for added pipe connection support. It flows from the inside out so sediment collects inside the filter.  The filter has an 80-mesh screen.

( )  Discharge Hose Model:  The discharge hose has a reinforced wire braid for strength and durability, it also is heat resistant, cleaning chemical resistant, and wear resistant. ( )  Thermo Valve Model:  The thermo valve protects the pump from premature failure of the seals by eliminating heat build-up in closed loop by-pass systems.  ( )  C.A.T.Model:  The Captive Acceleration Tube absorbs energy from a positive head to increase  fluid acceleration which significantly reduces cavitation, system surges, or hydraulic spikes. ( )  Vari-Nozzle Model:  The vari-nozzle can either be low or high pressure, just by pulling it forward or backwards. A smooth, easy right or left rotation adjusts spray angle from 0-60 degrees for cleaning flexibility.

Description

A.	INTRODUCTION. The Starfire Optical Range (SOR) Division of Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DES) is located at Kirtland AFB. The Government is interested in receiving proposals in the advanced technology development and research into optical beam control in the presence of the Earth?s turbulent atmosphere.  The total program hours budgeted for these efforts is 122,880 hours over five years (FY03: 7,680 hours, FY04: 24,960 hours, FY05: 24,960 hours,  FY06: 24,960 hours, FY07: 24,960 hours,  FY08: 15,360 hours.  Award to a single offeror is anticipated. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), 03-DE-02, will remain open 45 days after date of publication.  Proposals are solicited for solutions to the problems of optical acquisition/tracking, the sensing of turbulence-induced optical wave front distortions, and real-time mechanical correction of said distortions with adaptive optics techniques.  SOR has investigated and will continue to investigate application of these technologies towards:  1) high-resolution imaging of space objects; and 2) enabling of low and potentially high energy laser propagation systems that can realistically be expected to operate in the presence of the Earth?s turbulent atmosphere.  The contractor should consider innovative techniques for exploring technologies, concepts and applications in these areas.

Utilizing existing range assets and Air Force S&T and customer funding, the SOR seeks to explore and develop advanced techniques that will expand the current ?state of the art? of optical atmospheric compensation.  SOR is equally interested in demonstrating the defense-related capabilities and payoffs of this technology.  Contractors contributing to these efforts will be part of a large, dynamic, integrated team including military personnel, Department of Air Force civilians, and other contractor personnel.   The contractor should address each of the following concepts to insure the Contractor Statement of Work (CSOW) submitted is inclusive.

1.  Field testing of beam control technologies.  SOR is interested in the planning, design and engineering of experiment concepts investigating and demonstrating beam control technologies.  The particular interest is in such technologies as interfaced with large astronomical telescopes, in particular, the assets located at the SOR site.  The interest areas include both imaging and beam projection experimentation.  Innovative techniques and designs utilizing both specially developed technology and commercially available components are desired.  The vision driving all such experiments is the improvement of the Strehl ratio of overall telescope-atmosphere ?system?, and to measure, account for, and mitigate any factors that reduce the Strehl ratio.  To this end, we desire to investigate novel methods for both implementing adaptive optics concepts and measuring the performance of resultant systems.  SOR is especially interested in advanced, real-time Data Acquisition System (DAS) concepts for advanced electro-optical systems, as well as near-real-time processing, data basing, and storage of relevant assessment data.

2.	Analysis, modeling, and simulation.  Assessment of the relative merits of proposed and actual beam control technologies requires knowledge and a demonstrated ability to carry out detailed numerical, analytical and Monte-Carlo simulations of the propagation of light through turbulence.  The simulation of the interaction of light with real and proposed electro-optical and adaptive optical systems is also critical to expanding the state-of-the-art of this area.  Therefore, simulations of the ideas discussed in Area 1 are of interest.  Additionally, the SOR is interested in innovative approaches to analyzing the large volumes of data that would be collected from experiments in Area 1.  It is especially important that the relevance of the experiments to areas of DOD interest can be meaningfully extracted from such data and reported to interested parties throughout the DOD and government.  Unique algorithms and processes that are written in common computer languages and data visualization scripting languages are desired.  It is envisioned that these codes would be flexible, adaptable and user-friendly to the extent that they could serve the entire team of SOR scientists and analysts.

3.  Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program Status.  The engineering and analysis mentioned above works with the Ground-Based Laser (GBL) Advanced Technology Demonstration.   The effort will include contract coverage to SOR on current DEBCEA research effort (which includes the GBL ATD) including cost, schedule, and performance.  It is envisioned that contractor personnel will occasionally represent the SOR to other AFRL directorates and other DOD agencies.  They shall attend various program management meetings, project reviews, technical interchange meetings, etc., presenting and preparing materials describing SOR capabilities, activities, and ongoing projects.  External agencies include but are not limited to: government and non-government laboratories, academic institutions, all DOD services and government agencies.

B.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Work performed under any resulting contract may be classified up to the Top Secret Level. The contractor who is selected for an award under this BAA will be required to obtain a Top Secret facility clearance. Open communication with the Technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received.  AFRL evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation.

A site visit is scheduled for 28 Feb 2003.  Interested parties must fax a signed DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, and a Visit Request with clearance information for each visiting employee to the Project Officer, Major Allan Arb, AFRL/DES, FAX:  (505) 846-2213 no later than 21 Feb 2003.  Contractors must be U.S. citizens and will not be allowed to bring in portable computers, cameras, etc. The Project Officer will conduct surveillance of the visit.   No more than two people per firm will be allowed to attend the site visit.

The Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) term contract is expected.  In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror. If the offeror is a large business, any resultant contract will include a subcontracting plan, which will be submitted prior to award. In addition, AFMC 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause, will be applicable, with probable inclusion of Alternates III and VI.  The successful awardee will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the AFRL/DES support contractor to permit administrative access to proposal data.  Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.  It is anticipated that contractors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, in these cases, offerors will need to be certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) prior to submitting offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572), or logon to http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL for further information on certification and the approval process. All DOE Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs) and DOD FFRDCs C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory or Software Engineering Institute may submit proposals in response to this solicitation.  Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in the proposal that research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that the research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e). The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified.

For the purposes of this BAA the business size standard is 1000 employees, NAICS 541710. The acquisition is unrestricted, full and open competition. All firms submitting responses must reference this announcement and indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a woman-owned business, a hubzone certified small business, a historically black college or university, a minority institution, a veteran-owned small business or a service-disabled veteran owned small business.

C.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  Proposals will be evaluated using the following factors in descending order of importance based on scientific peer review: (a) capabilities and related experience, techniques or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives (b) overall technical approach and/or scientific merit of the proposed effort and its relevancy to current and future AFRL/DE needs, and (c) affordability. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the successful proposal other than price realism and reasonableness will be evaluated and negotiated on the proposal selected for award.

<CONTACT>Jay  Moore, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-2126, ext. 112, Fax 301-427-2164, Email jay.moore@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), Integrated Program Office (IPO), proposes to enter into a contract with the Ohio State University   Research Foundation (Columbus). The authority for execution of this proposed contract by NOAA is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The term of the contract will be for 12 months, with one 12-month option for extension to the term of performance.  During the initial year of performance, and expanding in the second year, Ohio State University will develop and demonstrate advanced technologies for interference mitigation in passive microwave sensors operating at C-band. In particular, a digital receiver-based microwave radiometer including an interference mitigation processor will be deployed in C-band brightness measurements from an aircraft platform.  The digital receiver will be capable of capturing 100 MHz of bandwidth at near 100% duty cycle through use of analog to digital converters (ADCs) operating at 200 mega samples per second (MSPS). High dynamic range (10 bit) ADCs will be utilized and are essential to this study; the resulting receiver will be capable of mitigating interference in real time through both temporal and spectral suppression operations. Interference mitigation algorithms will be developed in Altera Hardware Design Language (AHDL) and implemented in Altera Stratix Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) components. Data will be collected to quantify the ability of the interference mitigation processor to remove temporally and/or spectrally localized radio frequency interference contributions to observed brightnesses. These studies will be instrumental to designing and assessing modifications to the NPOESS CMIS sensor to improve performance in the presence of radio frequency interference.  The Ohio State University team has previously developed digital receiver technologies for radio frequency interference mitigation in microwave radiometry; the proposed project is based upon designs developed by this team. The expertise of this team has resulted in a digital receiver designs capable of capturing 100 MHz of bandwidth at near 100% duty cycle, and of mitigating interference in real time. The designs available are based on 200 MSPS, 10 bit ADCs, and intended for use in Altera Stratix FPGA components. The proposed co-Principal Investigators (co-PIs) have led a NASA sponsored Instrument Incubator Program to develop these technologies; the unique knowledge required to perform the studies of the proposed project is available only from this team. The Ohio State University team also has expertise in the design and implementation of interference mitigation algorithms. The proposed project will require continuous assessment and revision to the mitigation algorithms implemented in the processor, to ensure that maximum effectiveness is achieved. Past experience with real-time analysis and mitigation of radio frequency interference for microwave radiometry is essential for this project, and is available only from the proposed team. The system designs previously developed, the implementation expertise, and the experience in development and application of interference mitigation algorithms give the Ohio State University team the extent of unique expertise to perform this sole source requirement. The singular expertise and resources of the Ohio State team cannot be secured from other public or private institutions.  Any other party desiring consideration for this requirement must identify its full capability in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 days of this publication. No RFP or solicitation is available. No further CBD notice is planned.  See Notes 22, 25, and 26.

SECTION III
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
DoDEA 7-12 VISUAL ARTS PROGRAM

I.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of dependents of the military and civilian employees stationed in 14 foreign countries, 7 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. DoDEA enrolls approximately 106,000 students annually in grades PK through 12.  The school system offers a typical American education and uses materials and equipment comparable to stateside schools.

DoDEA is responsible for establishing curriculum and purchasing instructional materials for students enrolled in its 222 schools. The procedures for updating curriculum materials every 6 years are defined in the DoDEA Curriculum Development Cycle.  In accordance with these curriculum cycle procedures, visual arts educators have developed and written the DoDEA Visual Arts content standards (attachment 2) to reflect the philosophy and trends established in the National Art Education Standards. DoDEA also requires updated instructional development that helps correlate newly adopted instructional materials with the new visual arts content standards and professional development to help teachers effectively implement the new materials.

DoDEA currently requires educational materials and services for a Visual Arts Curriculum adoption covering the Visual Arts in grades 7 through 12. DoDEA will not purchase new text books, but will instead concentrate resources in supplemental art materials (print and nonprint), multimedia materials, and training designed to give DoDEA educators the expertise needed to implement the above mentioned materials.

II.  CONTRACT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

The contractor(s) shall provide visual arts program materials for middle school and high school instruction in grades 7 through 12 that compliment the current program. The current program consists of Introducing Art, Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, Exploring Art, Glencoe/McGraw- Hill, Understanding Art, Glencoe McGraw-Hill. The curriculum adoption program shall consist of instructional materials (art videos, art DVDs, art prints,  and appropriate art software), and related professional development training prior to the implementation of the adopted materials in the classroom.

The programs listed in Section III may be awarded individually or one contractor may be awarded more than one program. Priority will be given to the offeror(s) who include(s) many requirements into one comprehensive proposal

During the 18-month base period of this contract, the contractor shall provide instructional materials, pre-implementation in-service training, and web based, hot line, or other means necessary to support the scope of the DoDEA system.  The core instructional materials shall be ordered during the base period of this contract for initial introduction into DoDEA for School Year 2004/2005 and full classroom implementation during School Year 2005/2006.

During the four 12-month option periods thereafter DoDEA shall issue orders for the replenishment and replacement of instructional materials, as required by individual schools.

III.  INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND REQUIREMENTS:

Program materials to be supplied by the contractor for each grade level of each program shall consist of the following:
(1)	18 inch X 24 inch (minimum size) fine art prints. These fine art prints must be:
o	Divided into kits and each kit labeled according to grade level, name of company, Contract Line Item Number (CLIN);

In accordance with these curriculum cycle procedures, visual arts educators have developed and written the DoDEA Visual Arts content standards (see attachment 2) to reflect the philosophy and trends established in the National Art Education Standards. DoDEA also requires updated instructional development that helps correlate newly adopted instructional materials with the new visual arts content standards and professional development to help teachers effectively implement the new materials.

DoDEA currently requires educational materials and services for a Visual Arts Curriculum adoption covering the Visual Arts in grades PK through 6. DoDEA will not purchase new text books, but will instead concentrate resources in supplemental art materials, technology, software, multimedia materials, and training.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Scott Health and Safety (SHS) for the procurement of 130 Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) Universal Charging Wands.  The SCBA is a cylinder fed, open circuit respirator that supplies positive pressure breathing air to the user.  The SCBA is replacing the Oxygen Breathing Apparatus (OBA), which was once used primarily by firefighters aboard surface ships and submarines.  Only SHS can provide the universal charging wands for the following reasons.  The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has required all SCBA manufacturers to incorporate Rapid Intervention Crew/Company Universal Air Connection System (RIC) into all new SCBAs.  The new RIC system’s quick disconnect is different from the existing quick disconnect, thus ca using a compatibility issue between existing and future SCBAs.  SHS is the only company that has developed a hose assembly with a universal connection that will fit both existing and new SCBAs.  Additionally, SHS is the only manufacturer that provides a hose assembly that does not void the NFPA and NIOSH approvals of the SCBA equipment.

Offerors will be ranked based on technical evaluation criteria such as professional qualifications, specialized experience, technical competence, capacity to manage and accomplish the required services, and past performance.  The offeror determined to be best qualified will be asked to submit a cost proposal that will be subject to negotiation. Upon conclusion of negotiations, if any, the Government will request a best and final offer which will then be compared with the cost of performance by the Government.

The Government reserves the right to retain the work in-house and make no contract award.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.

<CONTACT>Linda Bender, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-338-9210, Fax 404-338-9233, Email linda.bender@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Atlanta, Georgia, has a requirement for Sign Language Interpretation to reasonably accommodate its deaf/hard of hearing employees working in various offices located in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area.  Sign Language interpretation is an ongoing requirement, with fluctuating needs arising throughout the year.  The IRS Atlanta (Chamblee) Territory presently has approximately 156 deaf/hard of hearing employees working in the Atlanta area offices during its peak season (October through May annually); and approximately 100 during non-peak.  The majority of deaf/hard of hearing employees work at the Atlanta Campus, located in Chamblee, Georgia.  The Atlanta Campus operates on a 24-hour day, 7 days per week work schedule, including Federal Holidays.

Sign Language interpretation is needed to accommodate deaf/hard of hearing employees in a variety of work-related settings.  Settings include, but are not limited to,  office and job-related issues  (e.g. work group meetings; employee orientations; training; conferences and seminars; employee/manager meetings, to include those regarding performance and/or disciplinary actions; and  other employment situations), medical or mental health issues (e.g. meetings with IRS Health Facility nurse or  Employee Assistance Program contractor), or assignments that may involve legal issues (e.g. participation in work-related legal procedures as a defendant, witness, suspect, etc.).

Interpretation services are primarily required for interpreting spoken English to American Sign Language and American Sign Language to Spoken English.  Any of the recognized sign languages (Pidgeon Signed, Exact Signed, Tactical, Oral, etc) may be required. 

The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supplies, and supervision necessary to successfully perform sign language interpretation services for IRS.

Only skilled Sign Language interpreters meeting the minimum qualification standards set forth in the solicitation shall provide interpretation services.  The contractor shall provide interpreters to perform services on-site at the IRS designated location.  Note: Alternate methods of interpretation service (e.g. video conferencing) may be proposed by prospective offerors. Such alternate methods are subject to review, evaluation and final acceptance by the Contracting Officer prior to contract award.
  
Offerors should note that IRS is proposing to hire and provide its own staff interpreter(s) to perform interpretation services.  Should IRS implement its plan for staff interpreters, the requirement for services under this contract is anticipated to decrease significantly.

Contract performance will be ordered based upon the actual needs of IRS to accommodate its employees, anytime 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, including Federal observed holidays. 

The contract term includes a base period and annual option renewal periods totaling 60 months.   All option periods will be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

Services will be ordered on an as-needed basis by issuance of individual task orders to the Contractor with as little as 24 hours notice.  Interpreting requirements may result in as many as 10 interpreters providing services on any given day.

The solicitation for sign language interpreting services is based on awarding a requirements type contract using fixed labor-hour rates.    

The solicitation includes two types of service requirements, On-Call, and OJI:

On-Call Services are interpretation services typically consisting of limited periods-of-performance.  On-Call services are used to accommodate deaf/hard of hearing employees for specifically identified tasks (e.g., attending a work group meeting or attend a training session on a specific date and time.)  
OJI services are interpretation services provided on a full-time basis (i.e. 8 to 10 hours daily) for designated deaf/hard of hearing employee(s) requiring on the job instruction, normally at the executive program level. Interpreter provides interpretation services on a full-time basis throughout the tour-of-duty of the employee.  Tours-of-duty are typically performed during the normal workweek (Monday through Friday) between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. 
  
The solicitation will be posted electronically on or about 03/20/2003 at the following website: www.procurement.irs.treas.gov .   The website should be checked frequently for updates.  Only sources having relevant contract experience performing similar services that are comparable in size and complexity will be considered qualified for award.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Notes 1 and 26.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is committed to meaningfully increasing the involvement of qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns in supporting its technical, scientific, and security endeavors.  Accordingly, the NNSA plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) inviting qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns to submit proposals for security and safeguards support services at the NNSA Service Center and its supported sites located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, NM.  The NNSA has determined that its programmatic and small business contracting goals can be satisfied by qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns; therefore, the NNSA plans to award one indefinite quantity task order contract having an estimated value of $50 million over a five-year period to a qualified HUBZone Small Business concern.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) specifies a corresponding size standard of $6 million. Development of the RFP is currently underway and the target date for issuance is August 2003.  Since a presolicitation conference or a preproposal conference will not be held - a final draft solicitation will be posted in July 2003 inviting comments from prospective Offerors.  All draft and final RFP documents will be posted on the DOE e-Center Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at http://e-center.doe.gov.  A site tour will be provided to interested Offerors approximately 15-30 days after issuance of the RFP; details will be specified in the RFP.  A draft of Statement of Work is currently posted on IIPS as an attachment to the Solicitation Form web page (click on the "Go to Solicitation" button located on this Solicitation Document web page). Since the NNSA will require all proposals to be submitted electronically via the IIPS system, Offerors will be required to register with and have a working familiarity with IIPS.  Assistance to register and use IIPS is available by clicking the Help button located on the DOE e-Center home page.  Submission of proposals by means other than IIPS is not authorized.  All questions pertaining to this announcement shall only be submitted via IIPS by clicking the Submit Question button located on the web page for this solicitation; any questions submitted by means other than IIPS (telephone, e-mail, etc.) will not be answered.  NNSA will make every effort to promptly post answers to questions submitted via IPPS. The NNSA mission includes being a responsible steward of the Nation's nuclear weapons.  The NNSA is a vital contributor to reducing the global nuclear danger through its national security, nuclear safety, nonproliferation activities, and nuclear materials stabilization by supporting a safe, secure, reliable stockpile, and the safe dismantlement and disposal of excess nuclear weapons. The multi-disciplined NNSA Service Center security and safeguards programs are the first line of defense against the insider threat and are designed to protect our most vital national assets.  These programs directly support weapons and national security objectives through an integrated nuclear weapon technology infrastructure and core competencies that ensure (1) safety, security, and reliability of the enduring stockpile; (2) the safe and secure dismantlement of nuclear weapons; (3) the safe and secure staging of nuclear components and materials awaiting permanent disposition; (4) proper classification and controlled information guidance is provided to the NNSA; (5) only trustworthy individuals receive/maintain a DOE access authorization to classified materials, information, and facilities; and (6) the protection of government property and personnel located at the NNSA Service Center and other sites located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is committed to meaningfully increasing the involvement of qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns in supporting its technical, scientific, and security endeavors.  Accordingly, the NNSA plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) inviting qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns to submit proposals for security and safeguards support services at the NNSA Service Center and its supported sites located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, NM.  The NNSA has determined that its programmatic and small business contracting goals can be satisfied by qualified HUBZone Small Business concerns; therefore, the NNSA plans to award one indefinite quantity task order contract having an estimated value of $50 million over a five-year period to a qualified HUBZone Small Business concern.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) specifies a corresponding size standard of $6 million. Development of the RFP is currently underway and the target date for issuance is August 2003.  Since a presolicitation conference or a preproposal conference will not be held - a final draft solicitation will be posted in July 2003 inviting comments from prospective Offerors.  All draft and final RFP documents will be posted on the DOE e-Center Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at http://e-center.doe.gov.  A site tour will be provided to interested Offerors approximately 15-30 days after issuance of the RFP; details will be specified in the RFP.  A draft of Statement of Work is currently posted on IIPS as an attachment to the solicitation web page (scroll to the bottom of the solicitation web page).  Since the NNSA will require all proposals to be submitted electronically via the IIPS system, Offerors will be required to register with and have a working familiarity with IIPS.  Assistance to register and use IIPS is available by clicking the Help button located on the DOE e-Center home page.  Submission of proposals by means other than IIPS is not authorized.  All questions pertaining to this announcement shall only be submitted via IIPS by clicking the Submit Question button located on the web page for this solicitation; any questions submitted by means other than IIPS (telephone, e-mail, etc.) will not be answered.  NNSA will make every effort to promptly post answers to questions submitted via IPPS. The NNSA mission includes being a responsible steward of the Nation?s nuclear weapons.  The NNSA is a vital contributor to reducing the global nuclear danger through its national security, nuclear safety, nonproliferation activities, and nuclear materials stabilization by supporting a safe, secure, reliable stockpile, and the safe dismantlement and disposal of excess nuclear weapons. The multi-disciplined NNSA Service Center security and safeguards programs are the first line of defense against the insider threat and are designed to protect our most vital national assets.  These programs directly support weapons and national security objectives through an integrated nuclear weapon technology infrastructure and core competencies that ensure (1) safety, security, and reliability of the enduring stockpile; (2) the safe and secure dismantlement of nuclear weapons; (3) the safe and secure staging of nuclear components and materials awaiting permanent disposition; (4) proper classification and controlled information guidance is provided to the NNSA; (5) only trustworthy individuals receive/maintain a DOE access authorization to classified materials, information, and facilities; and (6) the protection of government property and personnel located at the NNSA Service Center and other sites located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

<ARCHDATE>06222004
<CONTACT>RANDY JACKSON CONTRACTING OFFICER 3034452432     rjackson@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>NA The U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is requesting proposals for Research and Studies sponsored by the Weather Damage Modification Program (WDMP) from state offerors or state government/research entity offerors.  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships with states located within Hawaii and the 17 western states served by Reclamation, to address the potential for the mitigation of weather damage through weather modification techniques.  The goal of the program is to improve and evaluate physical mechanisms to limit damage due to weather phenomena such as drought and hail, and enhance water supplies through a regional weather modification research program, and to transfer validated technologies for implementation on operational programs. Weather-related natural disasters in the United States annually result in the losses of billions of dollars.  Drought, hail, floods, and tornadoes are among the most common causes.  The WDMP is consistent with national objectives to strengthen disaster mitigation capabilities of industry, and local, state, and federal governments, and with Reclamation's role as a water resource management agency. Efforts to directly mitigate weather-related losses through atmospheric water management technology (cloud seeding), are presently being conducted in many states.  However, local sponsors of these programs fund only the projects themselves, and provide few resources to scientifically evaluate questions on their efficacy, scientific basis, safety, and extra-area effects.  While state agencies are charged with the project regulation, and many also provide significant cost-sharing, little is being done to answer the questions that will ultimately determine how these technologies are improved and refined.  The WDMP is designed to produce those new technologies by funding scientific, peer-reviewed, research proposals submitted by state entities or state government/research entities having operational programs.  For fiscal year 2004, Reclamation is soliciting proposals in three (3) different research and study areas for projects of 12 months duration or less (follow-on funding may be available for additional research studies or future demonstration projects).  The areas of study are: Task A - Snowpack Augmentation for Drought Mitigation Studies; Task B - Rain Augmentation for Drought Mitigation Studies; Task C - Thunderstorm Hail Mitigation Studies.  State offerors or state government/research entity offerors must be willing to cost-share 50% or more of the project costs, as well as identify an existing operational program (or programs) that will allow the proposed research to be 'piggy-backed' onto existing operational cloud seeding activities and/or related research projects.  No profit or fee will be allowed.  Patent rights for any developments will be retained by the research partner (state offerors or state government/research entity offerors) in accordance with provisions contained in the solicitation. The WDMP is authorized in Fiscal Year 2003, Omnibus Appropriation Bill P.L. 108-7. Bureau of Reclamation - Water and Related Resources: The conference agreement includes $4,599,000.00 for the Drought Emergency Assistance Program.  Within that amount, $2,000,000.00 is for a regional weather modification program in the states of Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Funds in the amount of $400,000.00 is for draught emergency planning in Nebraska and $500,000.00 is to rehabilitate and replace existing wells and construct new wells in the City and County of Santa Fe, NM and $800,000.00 is for assistance to the State of Montana.   Also, Section 206(b) of the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-250) specifically authorizes Reclamation to fund the WDMP.  The specific provision follows: The Secretary is authorized to conduct a Precipitation Management Technology Transfer Program to help alleviate problems caused by precipitation variability and droughts in the West, as part of a balanced long-term water resources development and management program.  In consultation with State, Tribal, and local water, hydropower, water quality and instream flow interests, areas shall be selected for conducting cost-shared field studies on a 50-50 basis to validate and quantify the potential for appropriate precipitation management technology to augment streamflows.  Validated technologies shall be transferred to non-Federal interests for operational implementation. Proposals that were previously funded under the FY02 WDMP may apply for additional research funding through identification of new research needs under their existing contracts. Offerors interested in this project may request a copy of the solicitation package by providing a written request by facsimile to (303) 445-6345, or a request by email (RJACKSON@do.usbr.gov) or regular mail to the address provided herein.  TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.  The solicitation package is scheduled for issuance on or about July 10, 2003 with proposals due on approximately August 1, 2003.  It is anticipated that awards will be made in the early fall of 2003, with an anticipated project start date of no later than October 1, 2003.

<DESC>NA Skid Steer Loaders (SSL) will provide the Objective Force an array of capabilities that enhance soldier productivity and support essential tasks such as rapid runway repair that are critical to Enable Theater Access (ETA).  The accelerated tempo of modern combined arms warfare necessitates the need for a multifunctional system that can be rapidly deployed to effectively in execute mobility and sustainability tasks.  The need to rapidly shift battle focus, reconfigure and reconstitute forces, and move from o ne mission to another quickly and efficiently, demands assured mobility of the force be maintained.  This requires continual repair, maintenance and upgrade or roads and airfields.  The SSL is uniquely suited to perform many labor intensive tasks with a sm all footprint and to operate in restricted terrain/MOUT environments.  The SSL is also quite valuable when operating in conjunction with single purpose or larger systems, augmenting their capability.  Additionally the SSL is ideal when limiting the  effects of digging is critical to reduce collateral damage.  For combat engineers, the SSL significantly reduces manpower requirements for obstacle emplacement/marking and reduction/construction of protective structures.  The need for the SSL in constructi on units is two fold.  The SSL is capable of working in small tight areas where the Small Emplacement Excavator (SEE) or future High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE) cannot maneuver and tasks would have to be completed manually by soldiers.  Secondly, th e SSL with a smaller load and lift capability complements the SEE/HMEE by performing tasks that do not require the size of a SEE/HMEE, freeing it up to move and support higher priority operations where a self deployable vehicle is required.  In constructio n units currently equipped with SEE/HMEE, the Ã¢Â€Âœlike capabilities,Ã¢Â€Â though not as robust, allow a trade-off of equipment.  The SEE/HMEE is comparatively expensive and using two SSLs to accomplish like tasks in place of one SEE/HMEE will lower the SEE/HMEE requirement without compromising capability in certain units.  An Operational Need Statement (ONS) has been submitted in support of the need for the SSL to assist Combat Heavy units in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraq i Freedom (OIF).  The SSL is a solution for the Objective Force requirement for a small, selectably reconfigurable, lift and load system capable of providing mobility, general construction support, force protection, survivability and counter mobility suppo rt to construction and combat engineer units.  The SSL reduces mission time, soldier exposure and soldier fatigue.  For some of these missions, only an SSL is suitable because of manpower and time constraints.   These capabilities are required for combat s upport or combat service support operations throughout the entire theater of operations, and across the entire spectrum of conflict ranging from high intensity to Stability and Support Operations (SASO) and Small Scale Contingencie

<DESC>NA TRICARE Evaluation, Analysis, and Management Support (TEAMS) Contracting Office Address Defense Contracting Command - Washington,  Supporting OSD Health Affairs and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) 5109 Leesburg Pike, Skyline Six, Suite 401A Falls Church, VA  22041 Contract Specialist: Cindy Durling Contract Specialist: Pat Whitenton Description The Defense Contracting Command-Washington, on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), is seeking expressions of interest in the acquisition of management support services  under the TEAMS (TRICARE Evaluation, Analysis, and Management Support) Program.   TEAMS represents a opportunity to compete for the award of multiple contracts that will replace the present Program Management and Integration (PMI II BPAs) and the Defense Medical Information and Management/Design, Development, Operations, and Maintenance  Services II Ã¢Â€Â“ Technical Studies and Analyses  (D/SIDDOMS II, Lot I) contracts.   For information regarding the scope of the current PMI II BPAs or D/SIDDOMS II Lot I vehicles, please refer to the web page for TRICARE contracts at:  http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/otherservices/index.cfm?fx=contracts  The competition for the award of the TEAMS contracts will be conducted under full and open procedures; however, the contracting officer reserves the right to set-aside awards to small businesses.  Work will be performed in accordance with performance-based  work statements under delivery orders issued against indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contracts.  The term of each contract will be for a base year, options for four additional years, and award term options for five more years of performance, brin ging the possible term of each contract to a total of ten years.  TMA has categorized all its non-purchased care requirements into three broad  categories, as defined below, for purposes of identifying, avoiding or mitigating  against Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs) in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5.  These categories are defined as follows: Ã‚Â·	Category 1:  TMA Internal Support:  Services which, by their very nature, give the Contractor access to extensive data about the contracts of all other TMA contractors. Ã‚Â·	Category 2:  Program Management Support:  Services which assist TMA in planning and managing its activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  requirements analysis, acquisition support, budget planning and management, business process reengi neering, program planning and execution support, and independent technical management support. Ã‚Â·	Category 3:  Product Support.  Services or end items required to meet the mission requirements of TMAÃ¢Â€Â™s non-purchased care activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  concept exploration and development; system design; system developme nt and integration; COTS Procurement and integration; internal development testing; deployment; installation; operations; and maintenance. TEAMS is a category 2 requirement. Contractor participation in more than one of these areas may give rise to an unfair competitive advantage resulting from access to advance acquisition planning, source selection sensitive or proprietary information.  Furthermore, contractor participation i n more than one area may give rise to a real or apparent loss of contractor impartiality and objectivity whereas its advisory or planning assistance in one area potentially affects its present or future participation in another area. The purpose of this categorization is to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) to inform prospective offerors that TMA presumes that award of a contract or order in the subject category will give rise to real or apparent OCIs with respect to requi rements in the other two categories; (2) to assist current contractors and prospective offerors in developing their own busines s strategies regarding participation in TMA requirements and in identifying and, where possible, avoiding or mitigating against OCIs; and (3) to ensure that all current contractors and prospective offerors are afforded the maximum practicable opportunity t o compete for all TMA requirements consistent with the restrictions required under FAR Subpart 9.5 and sound business practices. For purposes of identifying, avoiding and / or mitigating against OCIs, TMA will examine all its non-purchased care requirements and acquisitions regardless of the cognizant contracting activity (e.g., DCC-W, GSA, VA, etc.) or the type of contract vehicle used (e.g., FSS order, Fair Opportunity competitive order under Multiple Award IDIQ Contracts, competitively negotiated awards under FAR Part 15, etc.).  Each TMA non-purchased care solicitation will therefore be designated as falling within one of the thr ee above defined categories.  The TEAMS Request for Proposals (RFP) is targeted for release by early Fiscal Year 2004.  Questions concerning the composition and requirements of the RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under TEAMS contracts, will no t be entertained at this time.  Offerors will be given ample opportunity to formally submit questions after the RFP has been released.  This announcement is an opportunity for those firms that are interested in participating in the TEAMS procurement to identify themselves. Such firms should submit a written declaration of interest to the following point of contact and should identify a poi nt of contact, an e-mail address, and a mailing address for the firm.  Telephone calls, e-mails, and personal visits related to TEAMS will not be acknowledged or entertained. No contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for any information or action forwarded in response t o this announcement.

<DESC>This is a re-announcement of an acquisition previously announced under Category R (see sources sought notice for Solicitation #NRCS-13-LA-03, posted 3/31/03).  This re-announcement serves two purposes: (1) notify potential offerors that this acquisition, which is being conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, is being transitioned to a Streamlined Competition under the procedures of the Revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. Certain deviations may be incorporated, as approved by OMB, for retention of the previous cost rules or procedures; and (2) notify potential offerors that it has been determined that the Brooks Act is applicable and procedures in FAR Subpart 36.6 will be followed. NRCS seeks qualified commercial firms to provide soil conservation technician services throughout Louisiana. In accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and the Brooks Act, the cost proposal of any selected firm will be compared with the Governments in-house cost estimate. A contract will not be awarded to the selected firm if Government performance is determined to be more cost advantageous. These services are currently performed by Government personnel. Major components of this work include: preparing and assisting in the preparation of formal conservation plans; preparing contracts for program funding, contract modifications, contract payment applications, and supporting documentation; performing conservation practice field investigations, surveys, design, construction layout, and final inspection of practice installation; documenting practice application according to policy and procedure; and coordinating activities with other federal, state, and local units of government and private groups and organizations. The applicable NAICS code is 541990. The anticipated date for receipt of SF-254s and SF-255s is on or about August 6, 2003. The U. S. Government reserves the right to retain the work in-house and make no contract award.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE TO CONDUCT SITE-SURVEYS, INSTALL, TEST, COMMISSION, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN INTERIM AND/OR PERMANENT FM BROADCAST FACILITIES IN IRAQ.  The U.S. Government, through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB) located in Washington, DC has an anticipated (but not guaranteed) requirement, subject to the availability of funding, for the complete shipping, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of up to eight (8) interim 1 kW and/or up to 13 (thirteen) permanent 1 kW, 2 kW, 5 kW, and up to 10 kW FM radio broadcasting systems provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in various cities in Iraq.  The IBB's Office of Contracts is conducting a market survey through this Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) public notice to identify vendors who are currently operating in Iraq and who are capable of performing this specialized work in a timely manner.  The vendor to which a contract is awarded shall be required to provide all supervision, security, site-surveys, labor, equipment, tools, materials, documentation, supplies, services, permits, follow-on training, staging, assembly, packing for shipment, and shipping necessary to complete the installation (including any necessary design and/or fabrication that is associated with the installation), testing, commissioning, and bringing to full operational capability several highly efficient and highly reliable solid-state interim (1 kW) and/or permanent (up to 10 kW) FM transmitting systems (consisting of mostly GFE).  In addition, the vendor to which a contract is awarded shall be required to operate and maintain each installed FM broadcast system through September 30, 2004 with a possible option to extend the work through December 31, 2005.  In order to be considered by the BBG/IBB to compete for this proposed work, interested vendors shall submit a comprehensive written "Capabilities Statement" which provides, at a minimum: (1) readily verifiable (by the IBB) evidence of specific examples of the vendor's successful past performance in the shipping, installation, testing, commissioning, and sustained operation and maintenance of broadcast systems (preferably FM broadcast systems); (2) readily verifiable (by the IBB) evidence of the vendor's current on-going operations in Iraq, the starting and ending dates, and an unclassified description of such current ongoing operations in Iraq; and (3) specific examples of the vendor's self-sustaining capabilities in Iraq that can also be readily verified by the IBB.  The IBB CANNOT guarantee security of any vendor's personnel, tools, equipment, transportation, translators, conditions of installation locations, or other logistics and/or operational support and/or on-site personnel/physical security capabilities required to complete the above-stated work in a high quality and timely manner.  A written "Capabilities Statement" shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Karen Harper, IBB Office of Contracts (M/CON), Switzer Building-Room 2529, 330 "C" Street, SW, Washington, DC 20237 not later than 15 calendar days after publication of this FBO public notice.  The IBB Office of Contracts (M/CON) will notify those vendors whose "Capabilities Statement" has been verified as meeting the above-stated minimum vendor capabilities to successfully perform the above BBG/IBB requirements of the opportunity to compete for this proposed work.  M/CON also presently intends to conduct a "Presolicitation Conference" in Washington, DC during July 2003 for those vendors who are notified that their written "Capabilities Statement," as verified by the IBB, meets the specialized performance and currently ongoing operations requirements in Iraq as stated in this FBO public notice.  Upon issuance of the solicitation to those vendors who meet the minimum capabilities criteria stated in this FBO public notice, the BBG/IBB may, if appropriate, award a contract without discussions with offerors who respond to the solicitation.  This FBO public notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site for the Department of Energy near Aiken, South Carolina, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to obtain license rights to market and distribute the following technology to commercial customers.  License rights may be granted on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  WSRC also may be available to assist in further research and development of the technology under a cooperative research and development agreement and/or may provide technical assistance during commercialization of the technology under a license agreement.  The technology is a new mounting system for flat panel video technology.  The plasma screen floating mount is a mounting system proven to eliminate vibration and dampen shock for mobile applications of plasma screens, thereby eliminating interference to the picture on the screen or damage to costly equipment.  Manufacturers recommend against mounting large screen displays in environments where shock and vibration occur.  WSRC devised the floating mount for use in a mobile laboratory van.  The large 42-inch screen using this mounting system provides stable, interference free pictures even while traveling at 65-70 mph.  The design of the current unit supports a plasma display screen with an approximate weight of 60 pounds.  The frame is designed to allow the display to “float” within a 2 dimensional space, both vertically and horizontally.  The ability of the screen to float eliminates vibration and dampens shock to the display in the event of external impacts such as pot holes or rough terrain.  The plasma screen floating mount should be useful for applications such as, medical, defense, environmental mobile laboratories, or mobile command centers, as well as numerous other governmental or private uses.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that July 24, 2003, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed nondisclosure agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a license will be required to submit a business plan prior to licensee selection and negotiations.  Company qualifications should include, but not be limited to, compatible product lines, sufficient manufacturing capacity, sound product develop plan, reasonable schedule for product launch, established distribution networks, evidence of sufficient financial resources for product development and launch.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice:  Dale K. Haas, telephone (803) 725-4185; fax (803) 725-4988; email dale.haas@srs.gov; or address Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #238, Aiken, SC  29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>A -- Laser Relay Mirror Workshop
<DESC>Title:  Laser Relay Mirror Workshop – 22-23 July 2003

The Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DE) and the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL/JTO) are hosting a Laser Relay Mirror Workshop at Kirtland AFB, NM, on 22-23 July 2003.  The goal of the meeting is to identify the most attractive and feasible applications of laser relay systems, to discuss architectures and Concepts of Operation/Employment/Execution for them, and to draft technology development roadmaps for these applications.  A panel discussion will focus on potential multi-Service missions, using surface or airborne laser sources, and with relays mounted on ground vehicles, uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs), or airships.  In addition to the panel discussion, there will be  presentations on critical technologies, platform options, and current and planned relay mirror demonstrations.  The second day, working groups will meet to discuss major military applications and required technologies.  These working groups will give out-briefs to the entire assembly.  A government-only caucus will draft a multi-Service and Agency laser relay development roadmap and identify potential Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topics for FY04.  White papers describing technologies and techniques relevant to the military use of laser relay systems, as well as potential FY04 SBIR topics, may be submitted for consideration by the relay mirror government caucus.  White papers should be no longer than two pages and potential SBIR topics should follow the standard SBIR format.  A more extensive white paper and/or a meeting may be requested at a later date. If you would like to participate in the Laser Relay Mirror Workshop, please contact the Workshop coordinator, Dr. Marc Hallada, Schafer Corporation, at 505-338-2853, mhallada@schaferalb.com, NLT COB on 11 July 2003.

<SUBJECT>Physical Access Control - Common Access Card Technical Forum - Updated
<DESC>The Physical Access Control - Common Access Card Technical Forum will be held at BAE Systems, Inc., 80 M Street SE, Washington, DC on 9 July 2003.  The hours will be 9:00am to 4:30pm EDT.  The BAE Systems facility is located directly across from the Navy Yard stop on the Washington metro's green line. Attendance must be confirmed by e-mail at frank.mazzone@navy.mil by 2 July 2003. ORIGINAL SPECIAL NOTICE:  Physical Access Control - Common Access Card Technical Forum The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston (SPAWARSYSCEN) is conducting a Physical Access Control ? Common Access Card Technical Forum on 23 JUL 2003 in Washington, DC (location to be determined) from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. (NOW CHANGED TO 9 JUL 2003 FROM 9:00 am to 4:30 pm.)  For years, manufacturers of Access Control Systems and readers have been asking the Federal Government for a set of policies and standards to govern the procurement of such systems for myriad Federal Agencies.  Several of these agencies have reached a consensus on Government Smart Cards/Common Access Cards and their role in the physical access community.  Further, a consensus has emerged on a Federal Credential Numbering scheme among these same agencies.  The vision embraced by these agencies is the recognition of a single credential or token for physical access across the entire federal government enterprise.  The Department of Defense?s most recent policy guidance on the use of the Common Access Card as the principal token for access to DOD bases, facilities and buildings reflects that vision.  While the opportunities for success are immense, the challenges to realizing this vision are daunting.  One such challenge is changing the commonly held definition of an ?enterprise?.  The federal government enterprise can no longer be measured in terms of hundreds or even thousands.  The new definition must be at least an order of magnitude above and deal with an enterprise of millions.  You are most cordially invited to a technical discussion of the opportunities and challenges this vision entails.  This technical discussion will be to provide clarity and foster cooperation between system manufacturers, reader manufacturers, and the federal government.  Any company that wishes to participate in this forum must convey its interest to Mr. Frank Mazzone, by e-mail at frank.mazzone@navy.mil, or by Office Phone: (843) 218-5411 or Mobile Phone: (843) 729-2601 by 23 JUN 2003 (NOW 2 JUL 2003).  Participation in this forum is limited to three (3) representatives per Corporation.  The proposed agenda for the forum is stated below: PROPOSED AGENDA Federal Government Perspective Department of Defense Perspective Standards Perspective  Communications  Credentialling Access Control Systems  Enterprise Definition  Reciprocity Definition Established Rules and Models  Encoding Model  Access Control Portal Model

<DESC>The Program Support Center (PSC) has a requirement for the Office on Women’s Health (OWH) to complete and disseminate a ToolKit to prevent overweight and obesity in adolescents with a focus on girls through a family oriented approach. This ToolKit builds on the success of the existing eating disorder initiative, BodyWise which distributed information packets to health care providers and school personnel. BodyWise has been evaluated and has been demonstrated to cause a significant positive change in the level of concern, attitudes and practices of school nurses in the identification and treatment of eating disorders. Preliminary work on this ToolKit includes bringing together experts to form an Obesity Steering Committee, reviewing literature and existing programs, conducting and analyzing focus groups with girls, parents and school nurses and developing and testing a draft ToolKit with pilot groups. The PSC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mary Lou Rife, Ph.D. of 2948 North Hampton Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20015 for her services.
The purpose of this 12 month contract is to adapt the ToolKit in accordance with the results from pilot testing, develop a prototype for demonstration purposes, develop a train the trainer manual for use with the ToolKit, develop a distribution strategy, develop print ready materials of the ToolKit, prepare and submit the ToolKit for Government review and approval, conduct training seminars, disseminate ToolKits and track dissemination of ToolKits.
This requirement has been justified in accordance with 
FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This project requires an in depth understanding of the elements of the Eating Disorder Campaign for the OWH which includes the development and facilitation of the Overweight and Obesity Steering Committee, production of a literature review on overweight and obesity in adolescents, conducting the OWH overweight and obesity focus groups, the development of BodyWise and the development of a draft ToolKit. Dr. Rife is uniquely qualified to accomplish this requirement due to her past experience in developing the Eating Disorder Initiative Campaign for the OWH which included the development and facilitation of the Overweight and Obesity focus groups and the development and pre-testing of the draft ToolKit.
Parties interesting in responding to this requirement shall provide a capability statement documenting their experience with similar projects focusing on overweight and obesity in adolescents.

Offerors that fail to furnish required representation and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration. Offerors are advised that pricing should be provided for the base year October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004, and each of four subsequent option years, the fourth year ending September 30, 2008. Pricing should be summarized by year.  Yearly summary figures should also be broken out according to the three major components identified under Requirements in Section 1 above (that is, TAM Services, Technical Support, and Technical Information Services).  Ceiling prices may be used.  That is, if the exact cost of the base or option year is not known at the time of the proposal being submitted, the offeror may include a ceiling price which would represent the uppermost cost to the government for that particular year, and not necessarily represent the actual cost, which could be lower. If ceiling prices are submitted, they will be used for evaluation purposes.    4. EVALUATION CRITERIA: This is not a best value procurement.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  GAO intends to make an award to the responsible offeror who proposes the lowest total overall price for the base and option years.  The government will determine lowest price by adding the cost of the base and each of the four option years for a total amount.

Niiler (1991): "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual".  Scripps Institution of Oceanography, SIO Reference 91/6.58pp., and updated in 1995, DBCP Tech Document Number 4).  Drifters must use the ARGOS system to send data using a 90-second repetition rate, with a 100% duty cycle.  The transmission power to ARGOS should be 1 watt or less.  The Drifters shall have Sea Surface Temperature, Submergence and Battery Voltage Sensors (see "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual" for complete specifications of all sensors, drogue, transmitter and drifter general construction guidelines); Drifters shall be built with a holey-sock "Mini-Drogue" that is a smaller (60cm diameter) version of the drogue specified in the "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual".  The length of the "Minim-Drogue" shall be chosen so that the drag-area-ratio of the complete drifter system shall be not less than 40.  The specific construction technique has to have a proven history of deployment at sea.  "Proven history" shall consist of 10 holey-sock drifters, transmitting for over 180 days without drogue loss.  Drifters shall use a "Mini-Drogue" with its deployed vertical center at 15 meters depth.  Specific "Mini-Drogue" materials and construction specifications:  a) The holey-sock should be made from fray resistant nylon clothe; diameter 60-63 cm, length computed to provide a drag-area-ratio of 40 or larger.  The holey-sock shall have at least three segments with supporting circular framing sewn into place.  Each segment shall have two pairs of 30cm diameter opposing holes, offset by 90 degrees from each other.  Drogue is centered at 15 m depth.  b) Inert ballast material shall be inserted into the lowest ring of the "Mini-Drogue" of sufficient weight that a net tension of 1.5-2.0 kg will be exerted by the tether on the surface float.  c) Rings made of hollow sea-water resistant, plastic tubing shall be used as the circular supporting framework for the drogue.  These shall be drilled to allow flooding d)  Attachment bridle of the drogue shall consist of hub and at least 4 spokes of 0.32 diameter polypropylene-impregnated wire rope radials, positively attached and epoxy-restrained at hub to tether from surface float.  Radials attach to top PVC ring using abrasions resistant cushions fixed at 60 - 90 degrees spacing.  10 cm-long rubber air hose carroting fitted where radial enter hub.  Attachment point of tether to hub covered with a minimum of 15 cm long polyurethane carrot.  E) The tether from the drogue to the float shall be at least 0.32 cm in diameter made of polypropylene-impregnated wire rope.  There shall be no sub-surface float attached to the tether.  The carrot to the spherical surface float shall be at least 15 cm long.  6.  SHIPPING CONTAINER:  The shipping container should be double walled container measuring less than 43" * 43" *43" cube capable of domestic and international air, land or sea transport.  Container should allow easy access for inspection and testing of instrumentation and ARGOS telemetry system at the point of delivery.  Containers and closures shall comply with the interstate Commerce Commission regulations, uniform Freight Classification Rules, or regulations of other carriers as applicable to the mode of transportation.  Individual Drifters should be configured so that deployment from Volunteer Observing Ships can be readily done without changing the shipping configuration.  The tether should be wrapped and taped with water-soluble tape around a water-soluble cardboard tube that should be left in place for deployment to prevent tangling.  The drogue should be wrapped with water-soluble paper tape that should be left on the drogue upon deployment.  The tape should dissolve quickly once the drifter has been deployed, allowing for an orderly release of the drogue.  Instructions for deployment should be attached to the outside of each unit.  Contractor shall complete the attached specification sheet and submit to Global Drifter Center before a GBL is issued.  Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provides calibrations and message format information.  7)  RELIABILITY CLAUSE - Drifter transmission power should last on average a minimum of 365 days.  A new "Specifications Sheet" must accompany any modification that is made if a buoy is found defective and is returned to the manufacturer for repair.  Manufacturer should cover shipping costs for any returned defective drifters.  Revised Specification sheets must be provided before drifting buoys are reshipped.  Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provide calibrations and message format information.
