<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to extend the subject contract for a basic period from April 11, 2002, thru July 10, 2002, and an option period from July 11, 2002, thru October 10, 2002.  This extension is necessitated solely to permit continuity of services during re-competition for a follow-on contract (see RFP4-00047).  Effort will involve range engineering and operations, Research Aircraft Integration Facility (RAIF) simulation engineering and operations, computer systems support and communications systems support. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase continuation of these services from Sparta, Inc., of Laguna Hills, CA.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1)--Only one responsible source.  Sparta is the incumbent contractor under NAS4-96009.  Any other firm, as prime contractor, would be required to implement their own unique business and personnel policies and procedures.  These include, for example, accounting, payroll, invoicing, procurement, and both profession and non-professional employee benefits (insurance, leave and pension plans).  These changes would involve considerable Government review and adjustment, and likely result in frustration of contractor personnel as compensation packages change and employee-employer relationships are jeopardized.  The current teaming arrangement (along with existing mentor-protege agreements), with their established roles and responsibilities, would also probably be disrupted.  Any new contractor would likely change management personnel, with subsequent revision to the current management approach and style for accomplishing the effort.  It is not practicable for these changes to be implemented for the short period anticipated by this procurement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

All of the items to be maintained are controlled by (and must interface with) the Access Gold™ Security Access Control System which reside on 3 operational Dell Optiplex Computers with Microsoft Windows 95 operating systems, internally mounted 3-1/2" 1.44 Mb Diskette Drive, built in CD-ROM drive, 4.0 GB SCSI hard drive, 64 MB RAM, with 15-inch VGA Color monitors, 1 parallel port, 2 Serial ports, a 16 port serial expander, all have internal IOMEGA 2 GB Jaz Drives with Seagate Backup Exec Software.  Two of the CPUs have 2 additional Serial ports.  There is an identical spare computer without the 2 additional Serial ports.  All of these computers have Dell service for the first two years.  The contractor is required to maintain the software on these systems, the video camera, digital signature pad, and the Fargo ProL printer that is used to print the Proximity picture badges.  There are uninterruptible power source systems for each of the computers that are to be maintained also. The maintenance shall be available on an as-called-for basis with up to 5 on-site visits per month included in the basic charges.  Maintenance hours are Monday through Friday 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. A telephone response is required within 4 hours of reported trouble.  Unless agreed upon by both NASA and the contractor, on site support is required within 48 hours (based on the twenty-four hour day.)  A 90-day warranty period shall cover the labor.

The badging station printer is to be realigned and cleaned at least twice a year oras needed.  Any update to the system software is to be installed as soon as practicable after its' release. All parts shall be furnished by the contractor. The scope of this Statement of Work is not to preclude other associated portions of the entire security system for Dryden.  This is to include, for instance, fencing, gates, both personnel and vehicle, closed circuit video applications, installation of either fiber optic cabling or copper cabling, upgrading of computer systems and/or software, integration of intrusion detection alarms, and installation of intercom systems. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Practical Technologies.  All items are controlled by and must interface with the existing NASA/DFRC security system, which is Access Gold™ Security Access Control System residing on three (3) operational Dell Optiplex computers.  In addition, NASA/DFRC has several specially modified security access systems that have been specially built by and are proprietary to Practical Technologies, Inc. who owns all the data and drawings. In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, NASA deems the Access Gold™ Security Access Control System and their maintenance to be available only through the original source, Practical Technologies, Inc.  This Purchase is considered to be a follow-on contract for the continued maintenance of the Access Gold™ system installed and developed for NASA/DFRC.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 8, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to make an award to Network Innovations, Calgary, Alberta Canada, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, to purchase additional satellite terminals, accessories, satellite usage and Mobile Packet Data Service (MPDS).  MPDS was developed by Network Innovations to be used in conjunction with SSA's Virtual Private Network (VPN) and, as such, is proprietary to Network Innovations.  The satellite systems are part of a pilot to provide services to American Indians residing on reservations in the mid-west. The satellite terminals must provide high-speed data services, including Integrated Services Digital Network and Public Switched Telephone Network.  They must have two RJ11 jacks for fax and telephone, standard DTMF telephones, standard RS 232 interface, audio ports for headphones and tape input.  They must be less than 6 kg, easy set-up and FCC compliant in the mid-west.  They must be digitally encoded, capable of upgrade for encryption at the STUI level, and capable of making and receiving telephone calls.  They must have a corded telephone with terminal adapter, have an analog modem throughput minimum of 28.8 kbps, have capability for mobile access to HSD applications, and be compatible with Inmarsat's Broadband Global Area Network Satellite. Based on the proprietary nature of the required software, and FCC compliance, Network Innovations is the only source known capable of providing the required satellite system.  If any vendor feels they have the ability to meet this requirement, they must respond, in writing, to Joan Smith, Contract Specialist, Office of Acquisition and Grants, 1710 Gwynn Oak Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21207-5279, e-mail joan.m.smith@ssa.gov.  Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. on March 8, 2002 and must provide detailed information on how the vendor feels they can meet this requirement.  The Government will consider all responses, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely under the discretion of the Government.  This is neither a request for quotations nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation in response hereto will not be honored or acknowledged.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.   If no viable responses are received by March 8, 2002, the Government will issue a Purchase Order to Network Innovations.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for fabrication services for beryllium parts.  Thirty to forty parts will be machined.  The largest parts will include two 9-inch x 9-inchx 2-inch housings and 6 cones approximately 6 inches in diameter at the base and 10 inches long.  A number of smaller parts will also be required.  Machining will include, but not be limited to, lathe work, milling, EDM, brazing, chemical etching, and bonding.  Some parts will include flatness tolerances on the order of1 mil over 9 inches.  Cones, tubes and machined areas of the housing will have wall thichnesses of 0.05 inches.  Dye penetration testing will be required on all finished parts.  All parts will require gold plating. Some parts will also receive black anodized and/or passivation.  Beryllium I220H grade 2 will be provided for the largest parts.  Smaller parts will be made from S200F beryllium, which will be provided by the fabrication shop.  These services are required for space-flight hardware for the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA). Delivery of these parts is required no later than June 17, 2002. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Assys Technologies, Inc.  Axsys Technologies has facilities that can perform all of MLA's beryllium fabrication steps in a single locations.  Performing all of the fabrication steps in-house will allow Axsys Technologies to eliminate extra shipping, receiving and inspection time.  NSAS/GSFC will provide raw beryllium material for large parts, but Axsys Technologies will provide additional materials for other parts.  Having material on-hand allows Axsys to eliminate material ordering time. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 14, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Previous work has successfully demonstrated operation of mLHP's with evaporator diameters of approximately 1/2".  The goal of this project is to develop a reduced scale mLHP with an evaporator diameter of approximately 1/4", for typical space hardware temperature ranges and with a transport capability of tens of watts or less. THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR THE BREADBOARD PHASE ONLY (PHASE 2).  The total value of each award for the breadboard phase is limited to $50K each.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  The design phase (phase 1) was synopsized and competed in July 2001, and was completed in January 2002. The full requirement is for the acquisition of a prototype of a miniature loop heat pipe.  The acquisition will be conducted as a 3-phased procurement using a progressive competition down-selection technique between phases.  In this technique, two or more contractors will be selected for Phase 1.  It is expected that fewer contractors for Phase 2 will be chosen from among the Phase 1 contractors after a competitive down-selection, and one contractor for Phase 3 will be chosen from among the Phase 2 contractors after a competitive down-selection. Phase 1 is a design phase.  Phase 2 is a breadboard phase.  Phase 3 is a prototype phase. The competition for Phase 2 will be based on the results of Phase 1, and the award criteria for Phase 2 will include successful completion of Phase 1 requirements.  The competition for Phase 3 will be based on the results of Phase 2, and the award criteria for Phase 3 will include successful completion of Phase 2 requirements. NASA does not intend to issue a separate, formal solicitation for Phase 2 and Phase 3.  Instead, Phase 2 proposals will be requested from the Phase 1 contractors and Phase 3 proposals will be requested from the Phase 2 contractors, both by means of a letter.  All information required for preparation of Phase 2 and Phase 3 proposals, including the final evaluation criteria and factors, will be provided at the time the letters are issued. Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be synopsized to the Federal Business Opportunites (FedBizOps) web page in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203 unless one of the exceptions in FAR 5.202 applies.  Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that only the Phase 1 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2 and that only Phase 2 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 3, proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  Any other responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to the Phase 2 and Phase 3 synopses, and NASA will provide that source all the material furnished to the Phase 1 and Phase 2 contractors necessary to submit a proposal. To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.  This demonstration shall include the following Phase 1 deliverables upon which Phase 2 award will be based:  Design Review package in electronic format and 5 hard copies including proposed design, preliminary drawings, preliminary parts and materials lists, proposed cleaning and charge procedures, proposed tests and analyses, and expected mLHP performance capabilities, in accordance with the statement of work/specifications issued with the phase 1 solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DOC9. The anticipated date to solicit proposals from the Phase 1 contractors is March 1, 2002, with aproposal due date of March 29, 2002. All qualified responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 2000 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  If you plan to submit a proposal to be considered for the Breadboard Phase (Phase 2) award, submit your request in writing (fax or e-mail) for Phase 1 information to the identified point of contact.  Requests shall include the following information:  Company name, point of contact, address, phone and fax numbers. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential quoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for remedial maintenance and parts as necessary for an Eaton NV-1002 implanter. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to acquire the maintenance and parts on a sole source basis from Axcelis Technologies, Inc., Allentown, PA, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC owns an Eaton NV-1002 middle current, high voltage implanter machine; only five such systems have been built.  The machine is located in GSFC's Detector Development Laboratory (DDL).  This tool is fundamental for development and manufacturing of semiconductor devices.  It is imperative that this equipment be maintained operational with minimal down time, as most of the projects supported by the DDL depend on this machine.  This semiconductor tool uses many custom parts, which have to be calibrated and approved by Axcelis (formerly Eaton Corporation).  To maintain the integrity and reliability of the system, replacement components and parts must be manufacturer-recommended.  Axcelis is the only source for technical assistance and custom-made parts. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact on or before Marcb 14, 2002, 4:30 p.m. local time.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request For Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program.  The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate Fellowships to U.S. citizens and nationals who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering.  Preference is given to applicants who indicate an intention to pursue a doctoral degree in, or closely related to, aeronautical and astronautical engineering; biosciences (includes toxicology); chemical engineering; chemistry; civil engineering; cognitive, neural, and behavioral sciences; computer science; electrical engineering; geosciences (includes terrain, water, and air); materials science and engineering; mathematics; mechanical engineering; naval architecture and ocean engineering (includes undersea systems); oceanography (includes ocean acoustics, remote sensing, and marine meteorology); and physics (including optics).  NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with an accredited program in the appropriate discipline.  The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the institution of choice.  The current stipend amount starts at $23,000, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year.  Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military or other service obligation.  Assembled evaluation panel in the science and engineering discipline of the applicant?s proposed degree program review, evaluate, and rank the NDSEG Fellowship applicants.  Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research.  The present contract (F49620-99-C-0054) was awarded in 1999.  The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants' stipends and academic fees.  The present contract's period of performance for the pass through funding is scheduled to end July 2002.  AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract.  AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program.  The successful offeror will be required to work with the incumbent contractor, as necessary, to smoothly transition administration of the program; as well as be required to transition administration of the contract to a successor contractor when the contract performance period ends.  Functions required to administer the program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  advertising the NDSEG Fellowship program; soliciting qualified applicants; receipt and organization of applications; distribution of applications among the disciplinary panels for evaluation and to the three participating DoD services for selection; making offers of appointment to selected applicants and notifying unsuccessful applicants; administering payment of stipends to Fellows and payment of tuition and required fees to institutions; and gathering and maintaining data, suitable for analysis and presentations, from current and former participants and unsuccessful applicants.  DoD anticipates awarding a minimum of one hundred (100) and a maximum of three hundred (300) new three-year NDSEG Fellows each fiscal year subject to the availability of funds.  A basic performance period of three years with two one-year option periods is anticipated to cover three classes of Fellows.  Under a contract, the administration provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Feearrangement, the pass through funds for students' stipends, tuition and fees will be through a Cost Reimbursable arrangement.  The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $5.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  Interested sources are requested to provide a concise capability statement, limited to three pages, addressing experience relevant to the above described functions, to include experience in similar programs; knowledge of appropriate means to publicize the program and recruit participants; familiarity with issues related to conducting research in science and engineering; ability to attract university faculty members of the science and engineering community to serve on evaluation panels; cost accounting and financial management systems adequate to track costs, issue stipends and pay academic expenses; database management capabilities to gather and maintain data; and other resources necessary to conduct a program of this magnitude in a timely manner.  Reference to past customers for similar services should include organization name, point of contact name and telephone number.  Capability statements will be screened using the above described capabilities to identify qualified sources.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:   This technology represents a new, three-dimensional, general purpose, imaging technology that does not use intrinsic or extrinsic fluorescent labels but is instead based on molecular vibrations, making it theoretically applicable to any sample (e.g., biological samples, phase transitions in ceramic materials, etc.). The image formation is produced by CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy) making the method particularly useful for samples with strong Raman transitions. The CARS method uses two or more independently tuned laser beams such that the frequency difference can be tuned to a molecular vibration, thereby generating a species-specific imaging methodology without requiring fluorescent molecules that are either intrinsic to the sample being viewed or are attached as labels as does commercially available optical microscopes using ultrafast lasers. The time required for scanning an image is substantially less than with a conventional Raman microprobe since the signal levels are many orders of magnitude greater.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to issue a sole source modification for additional work under an existing contract which provides technical assistance for resolving comments on draft NUREG 1640, and preparing the publication-ready manuscripts and other materials for final publication.  NUREG 1640 contains methods for translation of concentrations of radioactivity in or on certain metals and concrete into radiation dose as a result of clearance of these materials.   In finalizing NUREG 1640, the contractor is required to review and respond to major significant technical comments received from the public, NRC staff, and the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analysis on draft NUREG-1640.   In an effort to respond to the technical comments, it was determined that additional work is required for resolution of the comments.  Technical Assistance is currently being performed by S. Cohen and Associates (SC&A) under Contract No. NRC-04-01-065.  SC&A is knowledgeable and has performed the resolution of comments for draft NUREG-1640, which entailed analyzing the parameter usage, model assumptions, and mathematical formulations accompanied by actual spreadsheet manipulations.  All responsible sources can respond.  Written responses should provide evidence of the respondent's capability to perform the required services.

System Design:  Final system design will be achieved once the RF Engineering is completed.  The design aspects will include: cable and connector placement, component placement, antenna placement, shelter & tower runs, conduit runs, rack requirements, and power requirements. 

Frequency Licenses:  Due to the frequency range of the proposed system, Contractor will provide the coordination to obtain the FCC Frequency License.  This should be one of the first steps performed of the system implementation due to the time that may be required to obtain the operating license.  Once the license and frequencies are obtained, the radio equipment will be shipped with the proper assigned frequency.

System Installation:  Contractor will install the proposed microwave system and follow the FCC and Wireless Industry Guidelines and Regulations.  The new system must be installed without interruption of the existing system.

Changing software or suppliers would be a duplication of cost, pose schedule delays, and inhibit ability to produce consistent and quality results for the program. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 14, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Rita Belfiori, 410-436-4205
<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332116 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Solicitation DAAD13-02-T-0005 is issued as request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation documen t and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-04.  Requirement is for a commercial off-the-shelf Grappling Hook, Collapsible (GHC).  The GHC shall be a lightweight, portable, and reusable device that can be used by the individual soldier for entry into, and exit from buildings (or other structures) during Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) missions. Since this is the continuation of an on-going program, the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center (RMAC) intends to limit competition to the following vendors, who have been previously identified and have met stringent technical requirements for their GHC: Schaeffer Marine Inc, Tactical and Rescue Equipment, LLC, and Safety Systems Corporation.  RMAC anticipates the award of a firm priced price contract.  The proposed contract will be in two parts.  Part 1 of the contract will include the purchase of a quantity of six (6) GHC (CLIN 0001). The GHC thus purchased will undergo the same testing as initially conducted at the onset of the program. The test conducted will be tensile strength tests on an Inst ron machine to ascertain if the GHC can meet the Governments average yield strength requirement of 1,608 lbs. Part 2 of the contract is an option (CLIN 0002) under which the government reserves the right to exercise the option, with one vendor considering the down-select criteria, to purchase up to an additional 2,400 GHC, based on requirements and availability of funds.  The down-selection evaluation will consist of tests conducted by military users to determine which GHC best meets the requirements. User tests will consist of attaching the GHC to a scaling rope and throwing it onto a second or third story roof (or inside a window). Soldiers will then attempt to climb up the rope and onto the roof (or inside the window). Data generated for the final down-se lection will consist of interviews and questionnaires completed by the test participants at the end of the testing period to determine which GHC best meets the requirements. Questionnaire forms will seek subjective and objective opinions from the user troo ps by utilizing a combination of items that will elicit open-ended comments, written by soldiers, as well as responses to “yes, no and multiple choice” type questions.  The GHC shall meet the following performance requirements: The GHC shall be compatible with the standard clothing and individual equipment (CIE) normally worn, carried, or used by the soldier. No interference with other standard CIE items is acceptable. Th e GHC shall be usable by the 1st to 99th percentile male Soldier. Appropriate dimensions include, but are not limited to, weight, height, and width at chest. These dimensions can be found in the 1988 Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Army personnel: Methods an d Statistics, which is available at http://www-sscom.army.mil/busops. The objective is for the GHC to support the weight of a 99th percentile male Soldier (238 lbs) with his fighting load (25-30 lbs) clearing the assault lead during MOUT operations. The GH C must have a built-in safety factor of no less than 6.0 (which means it supports 268 lbs x 6.0 = 1608 lbs, without bending) to ensure the GHC does not deform when supporting the weight of the Soldier with fighting load. The GHC shall be capable of being c ollapsed, folded or retracted into a compact shape. The desired weight of the GHC is 1.5 lbs or less. The GHC shall have a 1-inch open ing in the shaft to allow for the attachment of ropes up to 1 inch in diameter. The GHC shall not require any undue logistical considerations. Manpower, personnel, and training shall not be impacted by the use of this item. The GHC shall be capable of bein g set-up and ready for operation by an individual Soldier from its collapsed state within 30 seconds. Conversely, the time it takes an individual Soldier to reconfigure the GHC into its collapsed state shall be 30 seconds or less. These tasks shall be acco mplished without the use of tools. The GHC design and construction shall enable it to withstand rigorous usage including, but not limited to cross-country transportation, operation in extreme environments and at high altitudes, operation and storage in ope n air, and exposure to the elements for extended periods of time. The GHC shall be resistant to wear, abuse, rust, decay, and corrosion in operational climates. The GHC shall operate and function in all climatic types and at all altitudes and temperatures that fall within the range of –35 degrees F to +120 degrees F.  The GHC shall also be capable of operating during adverse weather and conditions such as, falling snow, sleet, rain, freezing rain, and blowing dirt/sand.  The GHC shall not introduce any unique requirements for maintenance support such as, maintenance facilities, tools, or Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE). No special or new Military Occupational Specialty/Additional Skill Identifier/Special ty Skill Identifier shall be required. Operator maintenance shall be limited to inspecting, cleaning and lubrication. MANPRINT (MANpower and PeRsonnel INTegration) considerations (encompassing the seven domains of manpower, personnel, training, human facto rs, system safety, health hazards and Soldier survivability) shall be integrated into the design of the GHC so as to allow its safe and efficient operation, and maintenance by the Soldier in all specified operational and environmental conditions. System Sa fety and Health: The GHC shall have no uncontrolled safety or health hazards and shall conform to best commercial practices and military standards when applicable. No part of the GHC shall introduce safety or health hazards to the Soldiers when properly us ed, transported, and maintained. Personnel operating the GHC will be able to refer to the operator’s instructions on the packaging. The items shall be preserved, packaged and packed for domestic shipment in accordance with best commercial practice. Shippin g container markings shall be durable and legible and shall include the National Stock Number (NSN) (if applicable), item nomenclature, quantity, weight and cube, contract number, and contractor name and address. Delivery of CLIN 0001 shall be 30 days following issuance of a purchase order; delivery of CLIN 0002 shall be 90 days following exercise of CLIN 0002 option. Delivery of CLIN 0001 shall be FOB Destination to the U.S. Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Co mmand, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  Delivery of CLIN 0002 shall be FOB destination to continental U.S. locations.  Delivery addresses for CLIN 0002 will be included in the modification exercising the option; however, a central point of Pine Bluff Arsenal,  Arkansas, shall be used for pricing purposes.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offers-Commercial, 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  The following factors, which are listed in descending orde r of importance, will be used to evaluate offers for the down-select:  1) Technical:  Capability of how well the GHC meets the performance requirements stated herein.  2) Price:  The proposed total price for GHC for CLINS 0001 and 0002 will be evaluated fo r fairness and reasonableness based on price analysis.  3) Past Performance:  The offeror’s relevant current and past performance in manufacturing and delivering GHC’s or similar items will be evaluated to determine the degree of ris k associated with how well the offeror provided a quality product and on-time delivery consistent with a cooperative business manner.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The IC portion must be able to run independently and simultaneously from the FIA portion of the system. (3) The system must be field upgradable for up to 8 analytical channels.  These channels can not be stacked over other instruments components reducing the risk of liquid leaking on electronic parts and causing instrument downtime.  (4) The system must be field upgradable when used with an XYZ sampler for an intelligent variable automatic dilutor with dual resolution capabilities. (5) The chemistry manifolds must not require compressed gas or debubblers/rebubblers. (6) All chemistry manifolds must use inert PTFE tubing or an equal. (7) All methods must include linearity, precision, accuracy, and method detection limit data. (8) The system must have a 1 year warranty on upgraded parts and labor with extended warranties available on request.  Parts or components must be available for loan within 48 hours of request made. Loaner part must be available both during and after the warranty period. (9) Vendor must provide a service to repack cadmium and sulfate columns eliminating the need for local disposal. (10) The system software must include the following features to reduce the time needed for the operator to run QC analysis.  This software must run in the background for each sample run and provide the following capabilities: A) QC limits for each QC check standard, both relative and absolute B) User-defined QC limits with out of range detection and immediate correction prior to any inaccurate data generation for any type of sample C) Automated QC/QA protocol to monitor both accuracy and precision D) Operator selected types of QC samples i.e. blanks, knowns, checks, duplicated, spikes, and spiked duplicated for each sample E) Automated calculation of the USEPA Method 
Detection Limit (MDL) (!!) The upgraded instrument should provide the ability to do selected nitrogen and phosphorus species analysis at the 2 to 10 part per billion range.  The methods to accomplish these low range an analyses should be documented and supported by the instrument manufacturer.  Technical support should be via internet access to a degreed Technical Scientist who will review and assist with questionable data.  Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice.  It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Lachat Instruments without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The anticipated award date is March 14, 2002.

<DESC>17(i). This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, the test program in FAR Subpart 13.5, and FAR Part 15, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

17(ii). Solicitation Number 7TF-02-0004 Request for Proposal.

17(iii). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-04.

17(iv). This is a full and open procurement under NAICS Code 541512 Information Management computer systems integration design services.

17(v). There are several contract requirements:  REQUIREMENT LISTED UNDER 17(vi).  Section 508 does not apply to this procurement.  

17(vi). Description: This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the need and specifies the requirements for design and development of one set of simulated radio control panels.  The simulated control panels will be installed in a Cessna-like aircraft cockpit simulator. The simulator cockpit utilizes full-size video monitors to simulate gages, dials, and other cockpit instruments. Because of space limitations caused by the video monitors, the stack of seven simulated radio control panels must themselves be reduced in size to fit into the cockpit configuration.  The simulated control panels will meet the requirements of the following paragraphs. The simulated control panels will duplicate the look, feel, and functionality of the actual radio control panels except as noted for each panel.  The actual depth of all simulated control panels will be not greater than 2 and 1/2 inches, and all control panels will be the same depth.  Measurements for the control panels will be taken from the rear edge to the front-most portion of the panel faceplate (excluding knobs, buttons, etc.).  The seven simulated control panels to be developed under this SOW include one Bendix/King KC-191 Autopilot control, one KMA-24 Audio control, one KR-87 ADF control, one KT-70 Transponder control, one KN-62A DME control, and two KX-155 NAV/COMM radio controls.  The six unique simulated control panels, when delivered, will include a data package that contains, but is not limited to dimensional drawings, parts list, pin-out data, electrical block diagrams, and circuit schematics.  An interface control document will be provided as the initial delivery.  General design criteria are located in the following paragraphs for the individual simulated control panels.

Detailed design specifications will be defined as the engineering design task commences.  Due to the space limitations of the cockpit discussed in Paragraph 1.1, a connector, mounted in the physical center of the rear panel, will be capable of mating with 50-pin ribbon cable carrying I/O signal, power, and ground.  The cable connector, when mated with the control panel connector, will be recessed enough to allow for zero-clearance.

The preferred data type for communication for the instruments utilizing RS-232 is 8-bit unsigned byte (char).

NOTE:  Due to technical problems in transferring data to FedBizOpps, the tables referenced below are not contained in this notice.  Please send your request for a copy of the tables to elaine.lacker@gsa.gov.

The KC-191 Autopilot simulated control panel will utilize +5 VDC discrete digital signal I/O.  It will provide outputs and drive inputs for the capabilities listed in Table 1-1.  Pin-outs will be defined as part of detailed design.

The KMA-24 Audio control simulated control panel will utilize discrete signal I/O.  It will provide outputs and drive inputs for the capabilities listed in Table 1-2.  Pin-outs will be defined as part of detailed design.

The KR-87 ADF simulated control panel will utilize RS-232 serial signal I/O.  It will provide outputs and drive inputs for the capabilities listed inTable 1-3.  Pin-outs will be defined as part of detailed design.

The KT-70 Transponder control simulated control panel will utilize RS-232 serial signal I/O.  It will provide outputs and drive inputs for the capabilities listed in Table 1-4.  Pin-outs will be defined as part of detailed design.

<DESC>Reduced manning and increasing mission requirements will demand greater competencies of Naval warfighters than ever before. Proper selection, training, and system design are inseparable components of a triad necessary to ensure that future combatants and related sea-service components are adequately staffed and have high readiness.

The Capable Manpower Future Naval Capability is dedicated to exploiting technologies that will enable rapid transition of products to fleet acquisition programs in order to improve selection, training and performance of Sailors and Marines, enabling significant Manpower, Personnel and Training (MPT) cost savings and improving warfighting readiness.

In order to ensure that the Future Naval Capabilities products will transition, an Executive Integrated Product Team (EIPT) comprised of Naval representatives for Requirements, Acquisition, Science & Technology, and Resource Sponsorship has been established. The Fleet and the EIPT have defined three equally important and complementary enabling capabilities. The three enabling capabilities are:

1.  ACQUIRE:  Acquire and match Sailors and Marines to the right jobs at the right time while balancing individual and Naval needs.

2.  DESIGN:  Design affordable warfighter-centered systems, organizations and jobs by applying knowledge of human capabilities, limitations, and needs.
.
3.  EQUIP:  Equip Sailors and Marines with effective mission-essential competencies when and where they are needed at affordable cost.

The Execution Office of the Capable Manpower (CM) Future Naval Capability (FNC), sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, is inviting pre-proposals. These pre-proposals should suggest new S&T solutions to one or more of the eight CM FNC Supporting Technologies detailed below:

Specific Supporting Technologies:

(1) Whole Person Assessment (WPA)

WPA will make the best possible training and career assignments for incoming Sailors and Marines.  It will maximize the use of their personal characteristics to benefit the individual and the Service, while reducing unwanted attrition and increasing career satisfaction, retention, and fleet readiness, now and in the future.

(2) Sailor / Marine Career Management System (S/MCMS)

Distribution, assignment, and career management administrators will be supported by sophisticated decision support tools, providing rapid assessment of personnel shortages and surpluses in specific units.  Mathematical models will quickly examine the many assignment combinations and suggest optimum matches and analytic tools to examine trends and patterns in the execution of important personnel policies.  A single, mis-assigned Sailor or Marine could have significant impact on the unit??s ability to perform.  The future distribution, assignment and career management system will be the cornerstone that ensures the Navy and Marine Corps ??put the right people in the right jobs at the right time.??

(3) Personnel Situation Monitoring, Analysis, and Response Technology (P-SMART)

P-SMART will provide the ability to quickly access and analyze comprehensive and accurate personnel information, and to make informed decisions to ensure the current and future health of the force.  Relevant force information will be available in the system, and the system will intelligently prioritize displays so that emerging potential problems or opportunities would be clearly evident to force managers. 




(4) Advanced Interface Design and Training Capability (AID/TC)

AID/TC will develop a prototype command and control interface using human-centric design principles.  Rapid prototyping technology will enable emulation of task requirements in future combatants.  The prototype interface and training capability will be delivered for transition to fleet acquisition and training commands.  With initial focus on Land Attack Warfare (LAW), AID/TC will develop prototype interfaces for the advanced Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS), and the follow-on integrated Land Attack Combat System.  The AID/TC effort will evaluate operator proficiency issues and develop an embedded and stand-alone training capability.  Stand-alone ??pre-training?? via personal computer or intranet will allow operators to gain valuable training on prototype shipboard command and control systems in multiple LAW areas prior to team training conducted at training commands and aboard ship. 

(5) Advanced Distance and Distributed Learning

Advanced Distance and Distributed Learning  (ADDL) will develop technologies and techniques to deliver training on-demand in remote locations.   ADDL will possess the capability to support distance learners in demanding technical courses.  This program will also develop authoring tools that support pedagogically sound ADL development.  Consideration must be given to technologies that optimize Sailor and Marine job performance by mating appropriate instructional techniques with existing and emerging networking and distributed computing technologies.

(6) Objective-Based On-The-Job Training and Maintenance Support for Individuals and Teams   (OB/OJT)

OB/OJT will produce tools, guidance and specifications to enable continuous learning and performance support beyond traditional schoolhouse or formal training programs.  OB/OJT will produce systems which optimize identifying training needs, providing training (through intelligent tutoring systems, IETMS, mentoring interactions, and simulation-based team training) and assessing training effectiveness ON-THE-JOB. 

(7) Virtual Technologies and Environment (VIRTE)

Develop and test virtual training systems to supplement and complement live training of Navy and Marine Corps warriors.  There is no capability for realistic VE training that creates a full-immersion perceptual illusion for the trainee that incorporates tactile, auditory, visual, haptic/kinesthetic, ballistic and environmental virtual technologies.




(8) Visualization-based Training and Support Systems (VISTRA)

VISTRA will develop and test shore-based and at-sea operational support, training, exercise support, and feedback systems for multi-platform undersea warfare planning and tactical execution, for use at the platform, battlegroup, fleet, and theater levels. 

Additional information regarding the Capable Manpower FNC can be found at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/futurenaval.htm.


Available Funding Levels, Period of Performance and Expected Award Instrument: 

Individual proposals that address emerging technology (6.2) or advanced technology (6.3) solutions are desired in the cost and period of performance range set forth below:

?h Yearly Funding:  not to exceed $750,000/year
?h Period of Performance: Up to three years
?h Total Amount of Award: Up to $2.25M
 
ONR anticipates that funding will be available to make up to eight (8) awards.  Proposals for less than the maximum dollar award are welcomed.  Awards will primarily be in the form of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to award grants, cooperative agreements, or other transaction agreements to appropriate parties, should the situation warrant use of a non-contractual instrument.

White papers must be received no later than 4 p.m. (EDT), 15 APR 2002.  White papers received after the due date will not be considered.  The technical part of the white paper should include the above stated items, but should not exceed 7 pages and should focus on the proposed technical concept and approach using the above-mentioned technical section outline.  The cover page and curriculum vitaes will not count toward the seven-page limit.  White papers exceeding the page restrictions may not be reviewed. Initial Navy evaluations of the white papers will be issued via E-mail notification on or about 24 MAY 2002. Detailed technical and cost proposals will be subsequently encouraged from those offerors whose proposed technologies have been identified through the above-referenced E-mail as being of "particular value" to the Navy. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as being of "particular value". However, the Navy's initial evaluation of the white papers should give proposers some indication of whether a later full proposal would likely result in an award. Full proposals will not be considered under this BAA unless a white paper was received before the white paper due date specified above.





Full Proposals: The due date for receipt of full proposals is 4 p.m. (EDT) on 08 JUL 2002. Full proposals shall consist of two separate sections, one for Technical and another for Cost. Both of these sections shall reference the BAA number and include the offeror's project title. Titles given to the white papers/proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not be merely a copy of the title of this solicitation. 

The technical section of the full proposal should follow the following format: 1) List of Project Manager(s) and a Description of Programmatic Structure (including Subcontractors if any); 2) Technical Objective and Expected Payoff, Quantified to the Extent Possible; 3) Naval/Military Problem/Deficiency Thereby Addressed and Resulting Capability Enhancements; 4) Proposed Technical Approach; 5) Schedule/ Milestones/Deliverables; 6) Relationship to Other Projects in Which the Offeror Participates; 7) Summary of Qualifications/Experience of Key Personnel (including formal resumes); and 8) Statement of Work (which should be provided as an attachment to the proposal and should otherwise be provided as a separate section that does not include proprietary information to allow for incorporation into a contract award). The technical portion of the full proposal, excluding the resumes, should not exceed 25 pages in length. 

The cost section of the full proposal has no page limitation. The cost section should include the following: a detailed Cost Proposal, a completed Certification Package, and a Small Business Subcontracting Plan (if applicable).

The detailed cost proposal should fully segregate costs by cost category and should include the following cost items, if appropriate: direct labor, fringe benefits, indirect labor, materials, subcontracts, consultants, travel, other direct costs, G&A, cost of money (COM), and fixed fee. Direct labor should show each individual labor category or person, with associated hours and specific unburdened direct labor rate. All indirect costs (including fringe, indirect labor, G&A, and COM) should show base amount and rate. Details/explanation of all other costs items should be given in this section. 

The cost section should be accompanied by a completed certification package.  The package can be accessed on the ONR Home Page at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/repcert.htm Proposals for CPFF contracts should use the certification package entitled ??Representations and Certifications for Contracts.??

For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI). The North American Industry Classification code is 54171 (replaces Standard Industrial Classification code 8731) with the small business size standard of not to exceed 500 employees. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  No portion of this BAA has been set aside for HBCU and MI participation, though their participation encouraged.  


Proposal Evaluation:

White papers and full proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance: 

?h Overall technical merit, quality, and feasibility of the research
?h Potential to enhance the overall management of military personnel, which includes selection, training, distribution, assignment, and the design of human decision interfaces
?h Originality of the research
?h Perceived need and benefit of the proposed research and understanding of the Fleet capability or warfare area to which transition would occur
?h The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Technical Investigator, Project Manager, and other key personnel critical in achieving the proposed objectives
?h The offeror??s facilities
?h Reasonableness of cost
?h Socio-economic merits (contracts only).


Use of Animals and Human Subjects in Research:

If animals are to be utilized in the research effort proposed, the offeror must complete a DoD Animal Use Protocol with supporting documentation (copies of AAALAC accreditation and/or NIH assurance, IACUC approval, research literature database searches, and the two most recent USDA inspection reports) prior to award. Similarly, for any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects, the offeror must obtain approval from the offeror's committee for protection of human subjects (normally referred to as an Institutional Review Board, (IRB)). The offeror must also provide NIH (OHRP/DHHS) documentation of a Federalwide Assurance that covers the proposed human subjects study. If the offeror does not have a Federalwide Assurance, a DoD Single Project Assurance for that work must be completed prior to award. Please see http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/howto.htm for further information.


Industry-Academia Partnering

ONR highly encourages partnering among industry and academia with a view toward speeding the incorporation of new science and technology into fielded systems.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a sole source Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of 10 lbs. of 6573 Propellants. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Based on the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(i), NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Alliant Ammunitions and Powder Company LLC.  This Alliant propellant was purchased previously and has already been through an extensive qualification testing with the shuttle program.  In order to switch propellant vendors, qualification testing would have to be repeated on the cartridge, thruster, and entire thruster assembly.  These costs would greatly exceed the cost of the propellant.  Competition of this procurement would not be feasible due to the qualification requirements to certify another vendor. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 5, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

SEE NOTE 1.  The proposed services will be obtained by a negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contract.  The base year of the contract shall not exceed $ 1,000,000.  Projects will be awarded by individual Task Orders.  Individual task orders are expected to be in the $10,000 - $300,000 range. The contract period is one year from date of award, with two - one year option periods with an additional ceiling am ount of $1,000,000 for each option year exercised.  Contract options may be exercised before the expiration of the base contract period (or preceding option period), if the contract amount for the base period (or preceding option period) has been exhausted  or nearly exhausted.  Unused monetary capacities from previous years (base and Option) can be carried forward to the present year.  The maximum contract value is $3,000,000.  To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contracto r Registration (CCR) database, via the CCR Internet site at http://ccr2000.com or by contracting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

NISA of substructures for construction, transportation ballasting and service loads may also be required.  Activities include finite element modeling of navigation components to establish performance characteristics and limit state criteria for input into time dependent Monte Carlo simulation reliability models on cast-in-place, floating precast, prestress, post-tensioned  concrete structures, and hydraulic steel structures using two dimensional and three dimensional models.  Concrete hydraulic structures would be cast-in-place concrete, specialized precast concrete shells with concrete in-fill, tremie concrete, roller comp acted concrete and pre-placed aggregate concrete or similar structures.  Hydraulic steel structures would include (but not be limited to) large water control valves and gates.  Some design work in regards to these structures may also be required.

<DESC>Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound (FISCPS) intends to procure "Tube Lox" Scaffolding in support of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on a sole source basis from Patent Construction Systems, Harsco Corporation, 1 Mack Centre Dr, Paramus NJ 07652. This procurement is sole source based on the requirement for the materials to be used with the extensive current inventory of Patent's "Tube Lox" scaffolding equipment.  Introduction of alternate scaffold products would be incompatible with the existing scaffolding.  Due to the unique nature of each manufacturer's scaffolding, intermixing different manufacturer's products poses a serious safety hazard. In fact, CFR 1926.451(b)(10) states, "Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be intermixed unless the components fit together without force and the scaffold's structural integrity is maintained by the user. Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be modified in order to intermix them unless a competent person determines the resulting scaffold is structurally sound." In the past, the Government has used MIL-S-29180B "Scaffolding Components, Steel, Tube and Coupler" to procure tube and clamp scaffolding.  The products received by PSNS when ordered to this Mil-Spec do not consistently intermix properly with the existing scaffolding equipment. PSNS has submitted recommended changes to the Mil-Spec to NAVSEA for review, testing and approval, with the desire to provide for future competitive procurements.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity supply type contract. The period of performance is from date of award through one year thereafter.  FOB Destination at PSNS Bremerton WA. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No telephone requests will be accepted. Requests may be submitted via fax to (360) 476-8701 or an email to julie_a_thomas@puget.fisc.navy.mil.

The purpose of this amendment to the PRDA (originally posted on October 19, 2001) is to: 1) clarify that vessel sales to interested parties is considered a viable option under this PRDA, 2) provide greater distribution of the announcement in order to reach foreign and domestic companies that were unaware of the original PRDA posting, and 3) offer interested companies an opportunity to visit the fleet sites to view the vessels available for disposal. 

Description:
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management/economic solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of any or all non-retention, obsolete vessels in its custody.  The Government will consider innovative solutions including, but not limited to, vessel sales and ship disposal methodologies using and/or developing Government facilities.  Due to budgetary constraints, MARAD must place emphasis on the cost effectiveness/economic feasibility of any proposed approach. 

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established three periods, March 19, 20 & 21, April 16, 17, & 18, and MAY 21, 22 & 23 2002, for interested parties to visit the 3 fleet sites and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  The purpose of the fleet site visits is to provide interested parties with a general indoctrination tour of the fleets with minimal boarding of a few vessels that are representative of the types, ages and condition of MARAD?s obsolete ships.  The site visits are not intended as opportunities to conduct vessel surveys or acquire detailed information on specific vessels.  MARAD requires those interested in visiting one or more of the fleets sites to contact the point of contact (POC) at each site to be visited not later than Friday, March 15, 2002 to request to register for the March 19-21 fleet site visit, not later than Friday, April 12 to register for the April 16-18 fleet site visit, and not later than Friday, May 17 to register for the May 21-23 site visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time and date for the visit.  The POC will also inform potential visitors of fleet security requirements that shall be complied with prior to and during the visit, and will provide information regarding the location of the fleet sites.  Fleet Points of Contact:
- James River Reserve Fleet, Fort Eustis, Virginia, USA  
- Mike Bagley ? (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, email - cynthia.stockwell@marad.dot.gov
- Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, Benicia, California, USA
- Gail Burch ? (707) 745-0487, email ? SBRFReservations.MARADWR@marad.dot.gov
- Beaumont Reserve Fleet, Beaumont, Texas, USA 
- John Hickey - (409) 722-3433,  email - greg.meyer@marad.dot.gov 
 Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

&#61608; Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
&#61608; Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
&#61608; Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
&#61608; Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
&#61608; Funding requirements and/or sales offers associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

&#61608; Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
&#61608; Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
&#61608; Cost efficiencies, cost sharing, and vessel sales or purchase approaches which will facilitate a near-term ship removal and disposal process
&#61608; Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
&#61608; Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
&#61608; Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels

Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution.

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.  As part of the best value decision process, the Government will also consider innovative technical/management solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria, which offer viable sales and/or cost-sharing approaches. 

The program funding level associated with MARAD ship disposal was $10 million in FY 2001.  However, no funding was made available for Fiscal Year 2002, and no established funding stream/guarantee is available for the program?s outyears.  The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 
 Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
&#61608; Production throughput/capacity
&#61608; Environmental considerations
&#61608; Worker safety and health considerations
&#61608; Hazardous abatement considerations
&#61608; Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
3. Cost-sharing or sales approaches must be provided in sufficient detail to permit a thorough evaluation of the proposed sales/pricing arrangement. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror?s may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

<DESC>This modification replaces the Description previously advertised.

C130 Engineering is seeking sources and a budgetary quote to replace or refurbish the chemical toilet holding tanks (P/N 2901-001) used on it?s fleet of twenty-seven (27) HC-130H aircraft.  Monogram Sanitation of Compton California manufactures these toilet assemblies (P/N 2900-001).  The current system has a serious problem with regard to internal and external leakage of waste fluid.  Numerous instances of chronic leakage have resulted in major structural damage.  The cause of these leaks is mainly isolated to the drain assembly P/N 3328500-1.  This neoprene rubber duct assembly is secured with standard hose clamps, and attaches at the tank and the externally mounted service panel for routine waste disposal.  Because this duct assembly is susceptible to the extreme temperature changes of high altitude flight, frequent leakage occurs.  Additionally, recent inspections have revealed leakage from the holding tank assembly due to deterioration and cracking of the fiberglass ?gel coating?.  We are looking for replacement, or refurbishment of existing chemical toilet holding tanks that are compatible with the existing toilet assembly; have a tank capacity of at least 24 U.S. gallons; can be emptied from the outside of the aircraft; has leak proof hoses and seals; and is FAA approved.  The vendor will be required to install one modified chemical toilet holding tank into a Coast Guard C130 toilet system for first article testing.  First article test period will be for six (6) months and the test criteria will be: no measurable leaks from the tank, valves, plumbing, or any components of the chemical toilet system.  Vendors must provide the Coast Guard with sufficient data that will allow Coast Guard personnel to install, operate, service and maintain the chemical toilet system.  Vendors that can offer acceptable replacements/refurbishments are encouraged to provide literature and specifications that clearly detail their product, and an estimated cost adequate to determine approximately how much this project will cost the Coast Guard.  Literature packages of less than twenty (20) pages may be submitted via facsimile transmission at (252) 335-6452.  Vendors are encouraged to arrange a visit to a U.S. Coast Guard facility that has operational HC-130H aircraft to gain a more thorough understanding of the problem described above.  Visits can be coordinated through MR. KENNETH BLY at (252) 335-6501 or email kbly@ arsc.uscg.mil.  All technical questions should also be addressed to MR. BLY.  This is a request for information only.

52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

 	1) Technical Experience and Past Performance

Technical Experience--The offeror shall submit documentation describing its experience as a company or corporation or by its employees or personnel they have retained in performing and managing maintenance and repairs of hoists.  Experience may be commercial and/or Governmental.  Offerors shall have a minimum of 10 years cumulative experience working on the specified types of hoists.   This experience requirement relates to the company and/or key personnel.  Thus, a firm in existence for less than 10 years, but having key personnel with at least 10 years of required experience, may be able to meet this requirement.

Past Performance--The offeror shall submit references relevant to the nature and magnitude of this requirement for the past ten (10) years from previous/current requirements of this type of work.  Required documentation shall contain the name of the reference, a point of contact, phone number and address for each reference.   This information shall be submitted with the offer and shall include, but not be limited to, contract number, scope and magnitude of the contract, point of contact name and telephone number.  It shall also include a short narrative which adequately describes the offeror's actual past performance.  For example, the narratives shall describe the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, as well as business-like commitment to customer satisfaction.  Past performance will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offerors lacking past performance information will be rated neutral (=pass).
  
2) Price    

Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  The lowest price offer will be computed by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basis period.  Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in Far 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness.

Technical experience and past performance are significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The above Provisions and Clauses may be obtained via Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil. All proposals must be mailed to Carl See at 97 CONS/LGCA, 205 S. 6th Street Altus AFB OK 73523-5147, or may be faxed to Carl See at fax number (580) 481-7472. Award will be made to the lowest responsive and responsible offeror. Proposals are required not later than 2:00 PM CST, 6 MAR 2002. All contractors must be registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration database prior to any contract award. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available. This solicitation is distributed on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Internet site only.

<DESC>NA This amendment is to inform offeror's to view an attachment located on the IBOP website https://abop.monmouth.army.mil entitled V4 Performance Specifications V3.1.  The Government requires a System Integrator and Service Provider for the management of the Appliqué Computers, and related System Integration and Support Services, as a part of the Force Twenty-One, Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) System.  The government intends to acquire approximately 1,500 to 3,000 Appliqué computers per year, and t he platform unique installation kits, installation services, training, site operations, field support and maintenance of these systems. The Appliqué computer is a ruggedized computer system, which consists of a CPU Unit, a display unit, a removeable Hard D isk Drive and detachable Keyboard unit.  The CPU should contain a current year technology processor,  a minimum of 512 MB of RAM, minimum 10 GB removeable Hard Drive and a full complement of I/O ports and interfaces.  The display unit is a minimum 256 colo r LCD with a minimum 800 x 600 pixel resolution.  The display has an internal touchscreen capability, and is fully sunlight readable in bright sunshine, with brightness level that is gradually adjustable from full brightness to total blackout conditions fo r night time operations. The Keyboard unit uses a standard 84 key QWERTY layout, which is hot pluggable into the Display unit. It also incorporates backlight of keys, which provides the user a range of brightness adjustments and full blackout capabilities. The computer system must be capable of running the Solaris X.86 version 8.0 operating system and FBCB2 application software version.  A detailed performance specification can be provided upon request to the Government POCs.  The Government POCs are Major E ric Piatt, 732-427-4061 and Mr. Joseph Hill, 732-427-2862.   This effort is anticipated to begin in November 2002 and is a five-year effort.  This acquisition for the PM Force Twenty-One, Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) is to continue the ongoing  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) effort, to continue to implement the Army's objective of digitizing the battlefield, and may transition to become the Full RateProduction (FRP) contract for the program.   This procurement is subject to Full and Open com petition.  TRW, Tactical Systems, Systems and Information Technology Group, Carson, CA is the incumbent on the initial LRIP effort which ends January 2003. TRW is the software developer under a separate Systems Engineering and Integration contract.  The su bcontracted computer manufacturers are Northup-Grumman located in San Diego, California and Paravant located in Melbourne, Florida.  The contract will be an IDIQ contract consisting of a five-year effort, spanning the 2003- 2008 years.  The contract type is expected to be Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) for the hardware and selected services, FFP for data and appropriate services, with T&M for selected support services and tasks. This contract will be awarded to a System Integrator and Service provider, who wi ll take the most current version of GFE FBCB2 software, load it onto either subcontracted or GFE computer hardware, install on various platforms and perform the support services as required at various site locations.  To mitigate the Government's risk in t he area of hardware production, the first two years of this effort will be performed using computer hardware that is to be produced by one of the successful initial subcontracted LRIP manufacturers.  The System Integrator and Service provider will conduct a competition for a potential second source of computer hardware using a government coordinated performance specification during the first year of this effort, complete a first article qualification and reliability test prior to a source selection.  The se cond year of the effort the computer buy may be 75% awarded to the successful LRIP manufacturer, with the winner of the source selection potentially subject u p to 25% of this years buy.  During the remaining years of the procurement, the System Integrator and Service Provider may determine the computer hardware source.   Award is anticipated in November 2002, with initial deliveries of computer hardware in June  2003, with support services, training and site operations beginning in January 2003.  Installation schedules will be established yearly, with site operations anticipated at Ft Hood, Ft Lewis and other locations.  Respondents should specifically address th eir capability to provide all the above mentioned services and activities at the various location required, how they would conduct a competition for a potential second source of computer hardware using a government coordinated performance specification dur ing the first year of this effort, and how the Service Provider would meet the government's need for a Total System Integrator.  Respones should be mailed to U.S. Army, CECOM Acquisition Center, AMSEL-ACCB-RT-K(MAT), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008 or emailed  to Alex.Matejka@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The synopsis/solicitation number is DAAD13-02-R-0011 and is a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Fe deral Acquisition Circular 97-17.  The Department of Defense (DOD) is seeking sources for a commercially available Individual Riot Control Agent Disperser (IRCAD).  The IRCAD is intended to provide the soldier with a means to disperse approved riot control  agents (RCAs) against individual personnel targets using a self-contained and portable disperser.  Additionally, DOD is seeking a realistic operational equivalent (inert or practice) training disperser.  DOD anticipates the award of a firm fixed price con tract.  The contract is in three phases. Phase 1:  This phase of the contract will include the purchase of 40 IRCAD and 40 training dispersers from each interested party no later than 30 calendar days after contract award (CDAC). Ship the 40 IRCAD and the 40 training dispersers to Commander, U.S.  Army Aberdeen Test Center, ATTN: CSTE-DTC-AT-WC-S (Mr. Butch Wagoner, 410-278-8516), Bldg 358, APG, MD 21005-5059.  Down select evaluation and testing of these dispersers is scheduled to begin 17 June 2002.  The Key Performance Parameter (KPP) criteria fo r down select testing during Phase 1 are:  The dispersers shall be able to disperse designated RCAs (5-6% Oleoresin Capsicum (OC), and either 0.1% Dibenz-(b,j)-1-4Oxazepine (CR) or Ortho-Chlorolbenzalmalononitrile (CS)) [Note:  CS is used as a generic refe rence to include at source's discretion CS powder, CSX liquid, CS1, CS2 and CSX] and inert substances for training purposes for at least 15 one-second spray/stream bursts (threshold), with an objective of 25 one-second spray/stream bursts, at 3 feet and 10  feet against individual personnel targets with an objective from the point of discharge to 15 feet.  Candidates’ products that do not meet threshold criteria will not be considered for further testing.  Candidates’ products that meet or exceed the thresho ld requirements will go into phase 2.   Phase 2 (Option 1).  This phase of the contract is an option to purchase an additional 170 IRCAD from the sources qualified in Phase 1.  These dispersers will be used for Government Production Qualification Testing (PQT) and User Demonstration (UD). The 17 0 dispersers shall be delivered within 21 calendar days after exercise of Option 1.  In this phase the down-select criteria for the dispersers are:  1) 90 percent reliability; 2) non-flammable dispersing solution; 3) employ while wearing work gloves, with and without liner (e.g., Military Black Leather, Shell  and Liner “Glove, Men's and Women’s, Light Duty, NSN 8415-01-310-7338”); 4) compatibility with an OC/Mace pouch size of 6.303 inches in length, 1.50 inches in width and 1.756 inches in depth (front to  back).

<DESC>The Southwestern Region of the U.S. Forest Service will be establishing Blanket Purchase Arrangements (BPA's) with qualified firms for an unspecified number of professional land appraisals in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas Panhandle, and Oklahoma Panhandle.  The total dollar amount of each appraisal is not expected to exceed $25,000.00, and each appraisal over $2,500.00 will be competed for among those firms that have established BPA's on a rotating basis among the firms that have established BPA's in the specific areas.  It is anticipated that the establishment of a BPA will be a two-step process.  Step one:  Firms expressing an interest in establishing a BPA will be sent a package of the general requirements of the work that might be performed under the BPA's, and list of evaluation factors that must be completed by the firm and returned to the Forest Service for consideration.  Step Two:  The evaluation factors submitted will be evaluated by a Technical Panel, and a "Pass or Fail" will be given to each firm.  Those firms who received a "Pass" rating will have a BPA established, and become eligible for consideration in the award of procurements.  Once a BPA has been established, those firms will receive, on a rotating basis, orders to bid on specific projects.  All firms interested in being considered for the establishment of a BPA should submit a written request to:  USDA, Forest Service, Southwestern Region, 333 Broadway, SE, Albuquerque, NM  87102, ATTN:  Christine O'Guin.

<DESC>The work includes four(4) indefinite quantity contracts for miscellaneous design and engineering services for underwater facility assessments of Government waterfront facilities at various locations, worldwide.  The general intention is for the contractor to provide design and engineering services that will be described and procured through appropriate task orders for each contract.  The government intends to set aside two of the three contracts for Small Business.  Two of the four contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.  Small Business size standard is $13.5 million over three years.
Underwater assessment includes, but is not limited to, underwater inspection; engineering analysis of existing conditions in comparison to design requirements, previous inspection reports and/or drawings of the facilities; engineering calculations for structural analysis with or without previous design calculations; documentation of findings; and recommendations with cost estimates for follow-on actions.  All underwater assessments will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers.  For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC).  That EIC shall supervise the diving, dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.  The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report.  The EIC shall ensure that all diving is performed in accordance with OSHA standards.  US citizenship is required for access to inspection sites.
Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings and SPECSINTACT specifications; bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; engineering report review; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; engineering calculations; static and dynamic structural and using computer modeling; three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including analysis of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes; water tank inspections in accordance with applicable standards of the American Waterworks Association and NAVFAC MO-210.9; and FHWA certified bridge inspections using NBIS standards for overland and over water bridges.   
A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.  This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations.  Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, potable water storage tanks, dams, water control structures; instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, bridges, underwater cables, or any similar structure.
The duration of the contracts will be for a period of one base year, with the possibility of two option years.  The guaranteed minimum amount under each contract shall be $20,000 for the base year only.  The estimated total amount contracted for each contract shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.    The selected firms for these contracts will be required to provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal for each task order.  Each task order will be fixed price. 

SF 254  Block 10 and SF 255 Block 8 should not exceed 20 pages total.  The other sections of the SF 254 and SF 255 is not restricted in page count.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to FACCO_PROPOSALS@nfesc.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that proposal are received at above site.  Submittals are due no later than 2:30 P.M. EST, March 26, 2002.
 
Firms that wish to be considered for this project will be evaluated upon the following criteria.  Criteria numbers one and two are of equal importance and the other criteria are shown in descending order of importance after criteria one and two.
1.  Professional qualifications and technical competence of the team proposed for this project in the type of work required.  Professional qualifications include professional registrations of the design personnel assigned to the project.  Qualifications for all diving personnel include the ability to meet OSHA safety standards and dive industry standards.  As well as professional qualifications for design personnel, diving team members will be evaluated upon certifications earned that are generally accepted certifications for the diving industry.
2.  Specialized experience in the type of work required.  This criteria includes experience in the following areas:  a.  Design and engineering services for repairs of waterfront structures using destructive and non-destructive (NDT) techniques.  b.  Static and dynamic structural analyses, including seismic vulnerability assessments and vessel/structure interaction analyses of waterfront facilities using computer tools.  Evaluation of both impressed current and sacrificial anode type cathodic protection systems on submerged structures.  c.  Experience with and capability to provide engineering submittals in electronic format(s).  (Submittals will include, but are not limited to:  contract bid documents, web-enabled multimedia inspection reports, three dimensional models and renderings.)
3.  Capacity of the firm to perform the work in the required time period.  Capacity includes the firm?s ability to perform multiple tasks concurrently in the required timeframe.  Condition assessment reports will be required with 60 to 120 days after completion of the field inspection, depending upon the number and size of the facilities inspected.
4.  Quality control and safety assurance procedures for underwater inspections, report preparation, structural assessments and design services.

These procedures need to be submitted electronically and are not included in the 20 page count.
5.  Past performance on projects of similar size and scope.
 
In addition to the above criteria, the following considerations will be used in the case that firms are found to be equally qualified.  It is the intent of the Department of Navy to award these contracts to firms that are the most highly technically qualified and these considerations will only be used in the case of equally technically qualified firms.
a.  Volume of work awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 month with the idea of sharing the wealth of DoD contract dollars among highly qualified firms.
b.  Superior performance on past contracts.  This may be demonstrated by providing copies of design awards, excellent performance evaluations, letters of recognition, etc.  These documents are not included in the 20 page count.
c.  Commitments that firms are willing to make to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, etc., in subcontracting possibilities.

Classification Code:	A -- Research & Development
Contracting Office Address
Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate, 2251 Maxwell Ave, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 
A ? REQUIREMENT
This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) requests proposals for Advanced Beam Control/Compensation Technologies.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBA), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals for the Analysis, Engineering, Research or Simulation for Optical and Laser Systems (AERoSOLS) program. Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) and Airborne Laser (ABL) transmitting systems, including the extended-range ABL (ER ABL) scenarios, require advanced beam control/compensation techniques to correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence.   The purpose of this acquisition is to contract for research, analysis, simulation and instrumentation development work relevant to beam control and atmospheric characterization.  The main technical objective is to perform modeling, simulation and analysis of advanced concepts and to baseline them for testing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Labs (MIT/LL) Advanced Concepts Laboratory (ACL).  Concepts with promising ACL results will be field tested at North Oscura Peak (NOP). If they show promise there, they will be candidates for insertion into the systems mentioned above.   A secondary objective is to develop or support innovative techniques for measuring and predicting atmospheric turbulence for the laser or imaging systems of interest. A third objective is to improve or advance instrumentation state-of-the-art for systems or experiments to advance the first two technical objectives.

1.  Concept Generation and Validation:  This objective seeks innovative concepts to improve tracking and atmospheric compensation for ABL, ATL, or ER ABL missions. It may include the analysis, simulation, experimental planning, experiment participation and data analysis, to verify the efficacy of said concepts. 

2.  Simulation and Analysis:  This objective provides for analysis and simulation in support of DEBA's various efforts in ABL, ATL, ER ABL and atmospheric turbulence measurement and prediction. It also includes tasks to provide data analysis of experimental data taken in support of these efforts. 

3.  Instrumentation Improvements and Support:  Design, build and implement Instrumentation primarily, but not exclusively, in support of experiments at NOP, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), and ACL at MIT/LL as well as various atmospheric measurement efforts  

4.  Atmospheric Characterization Efforts:  This objective provides for atmospheric characterization efforts that involve development of instrumentation and systems, data collection, analysis of data, and simulation of results.  The instrumentation development involves developing or improving sensors, data collection systems, and platforms. Data collection includes using these new systems as well as other existing systems as specified by the government.  Analysis of data includes observations from such systems as well as from other sources as satellite-obtained observations, radiosonde observations, and weather maps.  Simulations include efforts related to the measurement programs for incorporating estimated effects.

AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  2.  Affordability will be evaluated using the factors of reasonableness and realism. 3. This evaluation will lead to a categorization of proposals as Category 1, Category II, or Category III.  4. Proposal categories are as follows:  (i) Category I:  Well conceived, scientifically and technically sound proposals pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results.  Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals; (ii) Category II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals requiring further development and are recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I; (iii) Category III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs.  5. Following proposal categorization, AFRL will enter into negotiations with selected Category I offerors. Cost realism will be assessed for those offers selected for negotiation and price reasonableness will be determined prior to making any award. If AFRL enters into negotiations with an offeror, but is unable to reach agreement, that proposal may be displaced by a lower rated proposal. AFRL may at that time enter into negotiations with an offeror not originally contacted for negotiations.

F ? OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR AWARD: 1. In order to receive a DOD contract, offerors must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program utilizing a DD 1540 form. For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil. 2.  Interested concerns shall have or be capable of obtaining a SECRET facilities clearance.  It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal.   3. In accordance with FAR 16.301-3(a)(1), before an offeror can receive a cost-reimbursement contract, the offeror must possess an accounting system that is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.

G- MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION: 1. This PRDA does not commit the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract. 2. An Ombudsman has been appointed to mediate concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions. The Ombudsman does not participate in proposal evaluation or contractor selection. The Ombudsman can work with responsible acquisition officials to respond to concerns, but will not detract from the authority of the Project Manager or Grants/Contracting Officer. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain the confidentiality of sources. The Ombudsman at Phillips Research Site is Mr. Eugene DeWall, Director of Contracting, Det 8 AFRL/PK, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773; (505) 846-4979.

Both modules should include basic information about telework for Federal employees, how to get programs started, and how to track telework utilization.  The modules should also include some interactive tools that would help managers and employees establish and maintain a successful telework program.  You are asked to provide written information about your firm's ability to supply these modules, including your corporate experience or capabilities for supplying learning tools of this kind, to the address below by March 14, 2002.

<DESC>The Southwestern Region of the U.S. Forest Service will be establishing Blanket Purchase Arrangements (BPA's) with qualified firms for an unspecified number of professional land appraisals in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas Panhandle, and Oklahoma Panhandle.  The total dollar amount of each appraisal is not expected to exceed $25,000.00, and each appraisal over $2,500.00 will be competed for among those firms that have established BPA's on a rotating basis among the firms that have established BPA's in the specific areas.  It is anticipated that the establishment of a BPA will be a two-step process.  Step one:  Firms expressing an interest in establishing a BPA will be sent a package of the general requirements of the work that might be performed under the BPA's, and list of evaluation factors that must be completed by the firm and returned to the Forest Service for consideration.  Step Two:  The evaluation factors submitted will be evaluated by a Technical Panel, and a "Pass or Fail" will be given to each firm.  Those firms who received a "Pass" rating will have a BPA established, and become eligible for consideration in the award of procurements.  Once a BPA has been established, those firms will receive, on a rotating basis, orders to bid on specific projects.  All firms interested in being considered for the establishment of a BPA should submit a written request to:  USDA, Forest Service, Sosuthwestern Region, 333 Broadway, SE, Albuquerque, NM  87102, ATTN:  Christine O'Guin.

J85 Engine Industry Day and Pre-solicitation Conference Minutes
15-16 November 2001

1.	Col. James S. Johnson welcomed the attendees and made opening comments to the conference.  

2.	Paul Ford, the J85 Program Manager, provided some opening comments and presented a high level J85 program overview where he discussed the following topics:
?	J85 world-wide engine inventory
?	J85 three level maintenance concept that includes flight line, base I&#64979;Level/ATC Engine Regional Repair Center (ERRC), and contract depot. 
?	Overhaul requirement for MISTR items and engines 
?	The need to keep MISTR items returned from drone engines separate from all material was stressed because drone items are in some instances exposed to salt water.
?	The two improvement programs, Life Cycle Fatigue (LCF) and Propulsion Modernization Program (PMP) were discussed for information purposes only. These programs were presented because of the potential impact they might have on the BEQs.  It was stressed that the Government has taken LCF and PMP into consideration when they developed the BEQs. This discussion was provided to give the contractors a better understanding of improvements that are ongoing and their impact on the depot program.  The depot contractor is not expected to accomplish any of the LCF or PMP installation at depot level. 
?	Whole engines are overhauled at the depot only in the event of an ACI, an FMS return or if an FMS country that wants to lease an engine that is currently in AMARC, which must go through the depot. 

3.	The next presentation was the Navy J85 Program Review that was presented by Dick Branch, Navy Engineer and Rich Croley, Navy Logistician.  In their presentation they showed a number of charts that identified the components that are cost or readiness drivers for the Navy.  They also noted that the information was based on fleet wide data that included all levels of maintenance.  The Navy has not made a final decision on incorporating the PMP kits into the J85-4 and J85-21 engines.

4.	Lacradia Gadison, Deputy J85 Program Manager, presented a brief overview of the J85 program repair requirements identified in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD) that included:
?	Minimum Offeror requirements (skills/experience and facilities)
?	Review of requirements for the two transition plans 
?	Review Government responsibilities (GFM, correlation engines) and contractor responsibilities (including facilities, tools, fixtures, test equipment, and repair material after 24 months).

5.	Doug Pangborn, Chief of the OC-ALC Acquisition Support Team (AST), made the final presentation.  He described the organization and responsibilities of the AST.

6.	Normally at this time a review of contractors questions and Government answers would be conducted.  However, since EID was being combined with the Pre-solicitation conference this item was delayed until later in the day.

7.	Diana Carreon, J85 Contracting Officer, presented the Pre-solicitation Briefing.  In her presentation she reviewed the key aspects of the RFP and major milestones for the solicitation.  She stressed that contractors will need to provide prices on the Exhibits, not the CLINs.  In addition she indicated that the minutes would be provided to all attendees by 26 November 2001.
