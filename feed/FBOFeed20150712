Statement of Work:  
RELATIONSHIP- BASED HOLISTIC SELF CARE TRAINING FOR NURSES
Title of Project
VA New Jersey Health Care System (VA NJHCS) is requesting education and support for the Nursing Staff in self-care practices based on the facility focus on human interactions, adoption of relationship-based care and ability to advance self-care from within the healthcare system. Period of performance is from September 1st, 2015 thru August 31st, 2016.
Description of Need/Background
As a VA Center of Innovation for Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, VANJHCS looks to demonstrate excellence in the delivery of patient care. VANJHCS recognizes the importance of the healthcare provider's healing relationship with the self as an intricate part of the healing process and an important component of providing excellence in patient care.    
This Relationship-Based Holistic Self Care educational program reinforces the provider's relationship to "the self" and care of the self as an essential component of nursing practice.  Relationship to self involves a "sense of knowing" and a commitment to taking care of one's self in a holistic way -physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Self-knowing implies an inner awareness of the healer's or healthcare provider's personal needs, goals, values, beliefs, choices and confidence.  A lack of self-knowing may adversely affect personal growth and interpersonal relationships including the expression of compassion or empathy for others. Without a clear understanding of "self", the healthcare provider may not realize her/his full potential as a healing agent or her/his effect on other team members.  This lack of understanding could negatively affect a healthy or healing relationship with other team members and affect team work.  The therapeutic relationship between nurse and patient can also be affected. 
In the Holistic Nurse framework, wholeness and healing exists when the healer or healthcare provider is able to establish meaningful relationships with patients, colleagues and self.  Acceptance of self however, is not only dependent on recognition of needs but also on the doing of the work to meet those needs. "Self-care work "includes holistic mind-body-spirit practices and/or techniques that address physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wounds.
Nurses need to learn how to care for the self.  Restoring caring and compassion for self will restore caring and compassion to the nurse's nursing practice.  Nurses need to be supported in that journey as they walk down the self-care path of wellness and self-healing.  Learning holistic and resilient mind-body-spirit practices will help nurses to restore and renew the self, avoid burn out, promote compassion for self and others and model a personal wellness path for their patients and colleagues. 
The healing relationship to self will be strengthened by the holistic and self-care practices of a Relationship Based Holistic Self Care Program and will be reflected in a number of metrics.  Nurses will approach nursing practice with renewed mindful awareness, presence and intentionality. 


Description of Work
The contractor shall provide:
1.	 A sufficient number of credentialed educators/practitioners to conduct all educational sessions.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

<p>This Request&nbsp;for Information is to encourage early industry involvement for the Range Support Services (RSS) II contract.&nbsp; This is for informational purposes only and information contained herein may change as the strategy is finalized.&nbsp; Services are to be performed at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).&nbsp; Contract award is anticipated by June 2017 with a contract transition start date of 01 July 2017.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Government is anticipating release of the&nbsp;RSS II&nbsp;Request <a></a>for Proposal (RFP) Fall of 2015.&nbsp; This will be a full and open, two (2) phase source selection, utilizing Best&nbsp;Value<a></a>Trade-off source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government is encouraging teaming arrangements from offerors<a></a><a></a><a></a>.&nbsp; Only the three (3) most highly evaluated&nbsp;offeror <a></a><a></a><a></a>teams will be provided the RFP in Phase 2.&nbsp; Based upon previous industry feedback, each&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> team will be provided no more than twenty (20) program briefed personnel positions for proposal development in Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated value of this acquisition is $3.6B<a></a><a></a><a></a>.&nbsp; The Government anticipates a single&nbsp;award of a Requirements contract.&nbsp; (While the Government will abide by the intent of the Requirements contract wherein the contractor will receive the preponderance of the work identified in the PWS, the Government will reserve the right to meet mission needs, a large in-flux of customer requirements due to DoD shifting priorities, or work that falls under a governance structure, such as construction, through other means of support (e.g.&nbsp;government or through other contracts).)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp;resulting contract&nbsp;will&nbsp;have a potential 16-year period of performance (including options and award terms) plus be a 3-month transition period beginning on 01 July 2017.&nbsp; The pricing arrangements will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP<a></a><a></a><a></a>) (transition in), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF<a></a><a></a><a></a>) (range support services - organic labor (e.g. prime plus teaming partners)), and Cost&nbsp;Reimbursable<a></a> (CR)(travel, material, non-organic labor sub-contracts, and other direct costs).&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Offeror teams may not have any foreign ownership, control, or influence.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must meet all requirements of the attached&nbsp;DD Form 254 (e.g.&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must have&nbsp;Special<a></a>&nbsp;Access Program Facility (SAPF<a></a><a></a><a></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must have&nbsp;a proposal<a></a>&nbsp;team that has TS/SSBI<a></a><a></a><a></a> clearances and is program&nbsp;briefable<a></a><a></a><a></a> on Day 1 of Phase 2.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; See the attached security questionnaire required from every member of the proposal team.&nbsp; Any "yes" answers on the questionnaire is likely to result in an individual not being&nbsp;briefable<a></a><a></a><a></a> due to time to adjudicate.)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Proposals will only be accepted from&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> teams that have experience in all&nbsp;functional<a></a><a></a>&nbsp;areas of the Performance Work Statement (PWS<a></a><a></a>).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Government will perform a responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part&nbsp;9.104 on the prime&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a>&nbsp;and team-members in both Phase 1 and 2 of the RFP.&nbsp; The Government will not evaluate a proposal from any&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> team member that is found to be non-responsible.&nbsp; Non-responsible&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> teams shall not be considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government will not delay the issuance of the proposal submission due to changes in the&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> team's personnel security or facility status.&nbsp; Failure to meet and retain these requirements may result in an offer team's disqualification from the competition and from further consideration.</p>
<p>An&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> team's engagement with the program security office, for the&nbsp;purspoes<a></a><a></a> of meeting&nbsp;DD Form 254<a></a><a></a> requirements (e.g.<a></a><a></a>establishment of a&nbsp;SAPF<a></a><a></a> facility or program access), shall not constitute&nbsp;discussions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Source Selection Evaluation Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Phase 1 will consist of an&nbsp;offeror <a></a><a></a>self-scoring scorecard, utilizing a pre-determined set of criteria and associated values.&nbsp; The&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> team is&nbsp;required<a></a> to provide evidence to support the assertions in the scorecard.&nbsp; The Government will validate the information provided and calculate the&nbsp;offeror <a></a><a></a>team's overall score.&nbsp; Past performance (recency and&nbsp;relevancy) of the&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> team will be included in the Phase 1 criteria.&nbsp; The Government&nbsp;will<a></a> select the three (3) most highly evaluated&nbsp;offeror <a></a><a></a>teams to proceed to Phase 2 of the RFP - receipt of the solicitation.<br /><br />Phase 2 will be a trade-off consisting of the following factors and sub-factors, in descending order of importance:</p>

<p>Factor 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost/Price</p>
<p>The Technical Approach/Risk&nbsp;sub-factors are individually significantly more important than Cost/Price.&nbsp; <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Tentative Acquisition Schedule</span></strong></p>

<DESC>--- CHANGE 1 --- <br>  <br> The Theater Contracting Center (TCC) may establish a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with up to eight (8) general construction firms for a variety of construction, repair, renovation, upgrade or demolition projects at any Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany installation or facility.    <br>    <br> A Basic Ordering Agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between a Government contracting office and a contractor, that contains:  <br>    <br>  1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (BOA Orders) between the parties during its term;  <br>  2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided; and,  <br>  3) methods for pricing, issuing and delivering future orders under the Basic Ordering Agreement.    <br>    <br> A BOA agreement is NOT a contract.  Each Order issued against a BOA is considered a stand-alone contract, but shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, conditions of the BOA.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar/euro amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOA. And, there is no contract or BOA maximum dollar/euro ceiling.  <br>  <br> The intention is for the BOAs to have terms up to 5 years; however, in accordance with FAR 16, the Government shall review and assess the BOA annually.  If the Government decides that overall contractor performance has not been satisfactory during the preceding performance year and/or that the requirement for a BOA is no longer needed, the Government can cancel the BOA within 30 days of notification to the BOA holder (contractor).     <br>  <br> Only BOA Holders will receive a project scope of work RFP for review, estimation and proposal development.  The Government may provide the project RFP to the BOA Holders via email or through a FedBizOpps posting.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate project proposals in any methodology it deems necessary and/or appropriate (depending on complexity, dollar value, urgency, etc.) -- for example, Trade-Off; Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable; based on Technical Analyses in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(e); Lowest Responsible Offeror, etc.  The proposal evaluation scheme will always be specified in the Project RFP. <br>  <br> On the following amendment to this Pre-Solicitation Notice, submittal requirements to be evaluated for BOA Holder qualification, will be provided to all prospective offerors.  <br>    <br> If your firm is interested in entering into a Basic Ordering Agreement with the Government for the aforementioned requirement and your firm is able and capable of executing multiple Construction BOA task orders in short notices in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, please email your interest to Ms. Mary Harding at mary.j.harding8.civ@mail.mil no later than 1700 HRS local German time on 15 July 2015.
