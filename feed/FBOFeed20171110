<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>

See the attached conformed BAA with changes highlighted in yellow.<br/><br/>Amendment 01: The purpose of this amendment is to make administrative changes as highlighted in yellow in the attached.<br/><br/>Original Synopsis Below:<br/>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of novel computing architectures. The Page 3: Architectures thrust of the Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) seeks to demonstrate heterogeneous computing systems that provide the performance advantages of specialized processors, while maintaining the programmability of general purpose processors.<br/><br/>The goal of the Software Defined Hardware (SDH) program is to build runtime-reconfigurable hardware and software that enables near ASIC performance without sacrificing programmability for data-intensive algorithms. SDH will create a hardware/software system that allows data-intensive algorithms to run at near ASIC efficiency without the cost, development time or single application limitations associated with ASIC development. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the Domain-specific System on Chip (DSSoC) program is to develop a heterogeneous SoC comprised of many cores that mix general-purpose processors, special-purpose processors, hardware accelerators, memory, and input/output (I/O). DSSoC seeks to enable rapid development of multi-application systems through a single programmable device.<br/>

<DESC>November 10, 2017 - Please note that the submission date has changed to better accommodate the holiday period. Please enjoy your holidays.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) - Contracting Office - Defense Healthcare Management Systems (CO-DHMS), in support of the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) Program Office, intends to issue a sole source modification to contract N00039-15-D-0044 with Leidos, Inc. of Reston, VA, for operational management services (PSC D318) in support of its Tier 1 Enterprise Hosting Environment, in addition to the Tier 2 through 4 hosting environments already within scope of the contract.  The contract action described below may be solicited and awarded without full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1).<br /><br />N00039-15-D-0044 was awarded on July 29, 2015 to Leidos, Inc. after a full and open competition.  The total award ceiling was $4,336,822,777 across a potential 10-year ordering period, if all optional ordering periods are exercised and award terms are earned.  The contractor is providing an off-the-shelf (OTS) electronic health record (EHR) system for deployment across the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise.  Leidos, the prime contractor, serves as the service provider-integrator (SPI). <br /><br />MHS GENESIS consists of inpatient and outpatient solutions from Cerner and a dental solution provided by Henry Schein.  MHS GENESIS will replace functionality of core legacy systems (AHLTA, CHCS, and Essentris, among others), and will be deployed to both fixed medical treatment facilities and operational medicine facilities all over the world.  The Leidos Partnership is supporting the integration, configuration, testing, deployment, training, and sustainment of MHS GENESIS.<br /><br />On 18 DEC 2015 in synopsis number N00039_SNOTE_000C62BA, the Government announced its intent to add Tier 1 hosting to the DHMSM contract with Leidos.  Following this notice, the Government executed a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) on 29 JAN 2016 to add Tier 1 hosting scope to the DHMSM contract and modified the contract accordingly.  The Government's analysis of the Tier 1 hosting solution determined that the cost would exceed the estimate in the original J&amp;A; accordingly, the Government amended the J&amp;A to reflect the new dollar values, although the overall award ceiling of $4,336,822,777 remained unchanged.  The amendment also limited the time period of the J&amp;A to the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) phase of the DHMSM contract to allow the Government the opportunity to leverage potential future market changes that may enhance the competitive environment for the hosting services.<br /><br />On 10 OCT 2017, the DHA assumed all contracting responsibilities for the DHMSM contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.<br /><br />On 23 OCT 2017, MHS GENESIS went live at its final IOC site, Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC).  This "Go Live" was later than expected, and because MAMC is the largest IOC facility, and the first to practice in many of the medical specialties, the Government has been unable to fully analyze the system or finalize its IOC technical solution, which will be achieved before the Full Deployment Decision (FDD).  Over the coming months, MHS GENESIS will continue to undergo independent operational testing in support of obtaining its FDD, which will formally end the IOC phase of the Program.  In addition, the DHMSM Program Office will continue to monitor and assess the technical performance of the solution, finalize clinical configurations, and solidify the solution baseline that it will deploy during Full Deployment.  Because of the IOC deployment delays, these activities will not be complete until after the current hosting services expire.  As a result, the Government intends to issue a new J&amp;A to provide continuity for the hosting services, without which the Government cannot operate the MHS GENESIS system.<br /><br />The scope being added under this modification will allow for the ordering of operational management services for three additional contract years, to include Tier 1 hosting, on the existing DHMSM IDIQ contract.  The total ordering ceiling and the period of performance of IDIQ contract N00039-15-D-0044 will also remain unchanged. <br /><br />For this time period, the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health remains the only source for the required services.  The Government would be unable to finalize its technical requirement, and, if satisfying the Government's hosting requirement in another datacenter is determined to be technically feasible, would not be able to 1) compete a contract action, 2) allow for the provisioning of the new datacenter, 3) completion of cybersecurity Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements, and 4) transition of the system to a new datacenter, prior to the end of the three-year period without significantly jeopardizing the stability and functionality of the system.<br /><br />Please note that if the Government at some point determines that competition of follow-on services is possible, the Government will seek to allow for the appropriate time to compete a solution and allow for overlap between contracts to successfully transition between environments.  As a result, follow-on contracting actions may occur prior to the end of this three-year period contemplated by this notice.  Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps for updates about the DHMSM contract requirements.<br /><br />Currently, some MHS GENESIS capabilities cannot be fully realized unless they are hosted in the Cerner environment.  In order to fully enable these functionalities, MHS GENESIS requires direct access to proprietary Cerner data, which is only available within the two (2) Cerner-owned and operated datacenters at this time.  The proprietary data consists of quantitative models and strategies which are the result of extensive Cerner-funded research and development efforts conducted over 15 years.  The models are based on analysis of clinical, operational, and financial data associated and incorporate vast amounts of actual longitudinal patient data and information collected through other Cerner applications.  Forward deploying MHS GENESIS into any other hosting solution would prevent access to these models and data.  Significant functionality exists within the required system that utilizes machine learning and computational statistics to enable predictive analysis and decision support that directly impact patient outcomes.<br /><br />In order to support its analysis and to assist in ascertaining what hosting options are available to potentially meet its EHR hosting requirement, the Government requests that any responses to this synopsis include any potential solutions for providing secure direct access to the proprietary Cerner data necessary to fully enable the capabilities of MHS GENESIS with high levels of performance in a Citrix environment.  Further, the Government is requesting any information about timelines to 1) provisioning a new datacenter, 2) completion of cybersecurity C&amp;A requirements, and 3) transition of the system to a new datacenter.  Any solutions that do not clearly address and demonstrate the ability to fully satisfy these requirements will be considered non-responsive.<br /><br />Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing these services may be considered by the Agency.  Interested parties shall identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis within 15 calendar days of publication, and must clearly demonstrate their ability to successfully fulfill all of the above requirements, including written permission from Cerner to connect to its proprietary data.  The Government reserves the right not to respond to any expressions of interest received.<br /><br />Any comments, questions, or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to Matthew Hudson, Contracting Officer at matthew.g.hudson2.civ@mail.mil.  No telephone responses will be accepted.<br /><br />Submissions will NOT be reimbursed by the Government and the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Any Justification &amp; Approval resulting from a decision to award the proposed sole source action will be posted on this website.<br /><br />All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Submissions will not be returned nor will the Government confirm receipt of submissions.<br /><br />In addition, respondents should be aware that the DHMSM Program Office may utilize contractor support personnel from the below listed companies (under existing contracts) to review responses and information submitted.  These companies and individual employees are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information, and they will take all reasonable action necessary to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a respondent's proprietary data.  Submissions MUST clearly state whether permission is granted allowing the program office support contractors identified below access to any proprietary information:
