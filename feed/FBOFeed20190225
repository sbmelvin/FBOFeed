<RESPDATE>030619
<ARCHDATE>03072019
<CONTACT>WASHINGTONI NLN, CONTRACT OFFICER, Email washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov
<DESC><strong>THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</strong> Under the authority of FAR 13.106, the USDA ARS intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Firm Fixed Purchase Order (PO) to Brigham Young University (BYU), a-285 ASB Campus Drive, Provo, UT 84602-1231. For continuity of required services &amp; research data, this order will attain additional BYU Services for Genome Sequencing using PacBio Sequel in support of the ongoing research at USDA ARS, Forage and Range Research Laboratory, (FRRL), Logan, UT.
<p><strong>The Firm Fixed PO will include the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. BYU SERVICES: GENOMIC DNA SEQUENCING WHICH INCLUDES:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; SMRT cell for v3 cells; approximately 62+ cells for this project. <br />&bull; Isolating very high MW genomic DNA and then shearing it to 60kb on BYU Megaruptor. <br />&bull; Libraries will be constructed using the PacBio SMRTbell Express Template Prep kit and then purified on a blue-pippin size selection gel using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. <br />&bull; DNA sizing will be checked using a fragment anlayzer and or pulsed field gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p><strong>2. BYU DATA ANALYSIS REPORTS &amp; DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>USDA ARS, FRRL</strong> research has an essential requirement for genome sequencing of hexaploid hard fescue using a new version 3.0 of the PacBio Sequel platform, which gives sequence reads at an average of 40kb and is sequenced on &lsquo;SMRT' cells. In this process, FRRL requires ultra-pure PacBio sequel v3.0 DNA library preparation with additional purification, size selection above 40kb, sequencing of up to 60 SMRT cells with the version 3.0 Sequel chemistry, and guaranteed sequencing of 13 Gb of high-quality sequence per SMRT cell.</p>
<p>FRRL sequencing requires ultra-pure DNA that is high molecular weight - in order to provide long reads in excess of 30Gb. The BYU DNASC is the only PacBio vendor with expertise in DNA purification and high length and quality sequencing that provides this. They alone conduct an internal DNA purification method to ensure pure high molecular weight DNA. Although other vendors do conduct PacBio Sequencing, none conduct the essential additional purifications to FRRL's DNA as part of their library construction nor guarantee FRRL at least 13Gb per SMRT cell. BYU DNASC is the only one.</p>
<p><strong>Along with FAR Part 12 &amp; FAR Subpart 13.106 procedures, pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETTIVE QUOTES;</strong> a determination, by the Government, not to compete this proposed order/contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit documentation that clearly demonstrates their capability. The Government will consider all responses received by<strong> 10:30AM PST, MARCH 06, 2019.</strong> Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to the Primary Point of Contact: Washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov.</p>
<p><strong>THE AWARD DATE WILL BE ON OR ABOUT MARCH 07, 2019,</strong> and again, this Notice of Intent is not considered as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Open Medicine Institute (OMI) for Multi-site Clinical Assessment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) in Children and Adolescents (a.k.a. Pediatric MCAM study). This contract is to collect follow-up data on the patients seen by the OMI clinician network at the Baseline phase. For patient confidentiality, no alternative vendor could contribute this follow-up data collection. Additionally, this contractor will allow us to have sufficient and timely data to examine the similarities and differences between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls and whether they are comparable to adult cohorts that we will be closing the work under a previous contract. Open Medicine Institute (OMI) established a clinician network as OMI consortium to recruit patients at the Baseline phase for th MCAM study. OMI has been working with the CDC ME/CFS program by contributing their patient data for the MCAM study since 2012. In addition, no other vendor can conduct the follow-up data collection for the patients previously enrolled by OMI, by the nature of the follow-up phase of the MCAM study we will use the procedures described in the IRB approved protocol to monitor the changes over time.
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).

<CONTACT>Sarah Turner, Contract Specialist, Email KWP9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to VWR International, LLC for the purchase of PCR Kits, reagents, and related materials. These materials are required to maintain and continue existing molecular diagnostics research in the Dengue Branch laboratory. These reagents ensure the operational readiness of critical laboratory instruments. The laboratory participates in standard laboratory operations as well as public health emergencies; the materials have proven to produce high quality data in molecular diagnostics research. Reagents from vendors other than VWR would negatively impact the validity of results. Without valid, reliable, and reproducible results, years of research would be jeopardized because data from an incompatible system would not be directly comparable or consistent with data that has been collected and analyzed over time. Due to the highly technical, carefully engineered nature of the molecular laboratory instruments, VWR is the only vendor that can provide these reagents. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS; however, all quotations/responses received within four (4) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a market survey for upgraded Land Mobile Radio (LMR) communication capabilities to substantially reduce and/or eliminate the radio dead zones in order to safely support field operations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel. The Government has created an initial design based on linear simulcast technology.  Also included are stand-alone repeaters at certain locations to support Office of Field Operations (OFO).  Simulcast is required based on the limited spectrum in the areas requiring improved coverage. This effort must validate the initial Government design, deliver, install, configure, integrate, and test the solution as well as provide training and documentation.  The project will provide the specific hardware, software, accessories, and services required to deliver a fully-functional system. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this market survey. 

It is the FAAs intent to develop, award, and administer a contractual agreement on behalf of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to support this effort.

Responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals at this time. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense. 

The FAA anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance consisting of one (1) 24 month base period with one (1) 12 month option period.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

This market survey will be utilized to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, in particular service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the required support. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1,250 employees.  

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors based on the attached draft SOW:

1. Clearly state whether or not you can meet all of the requirements of the SOW; e.g., Program Management, System Design, System Staging and Implementation, Training, and Testing.

2. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
     - Type of services provided by your firm
     - Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)
     - Number of years in business

3. Business size
     
All responses to this market survey must be received by 12:00 p.m. CT on March 11, 2019.   All responses to this announcement should be submitted via email to the Contracting Specialist and Technical POC at the following:

bill.white@faa.gov (Contracting Specialist)

Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  As a minimum, the following should be provided in SF330, Part I, Section F:
(1)	Block 25: Include the DUNS number along with each firm name.
(2)	Block 21: Include a contract number or project identification number.
(3)	Block 23(c): Include an email address and phone number for the point of contact.
(4)	Block 24: Include (a) contract period of performance; (b) contract award amount; (c) estimated construction cost; (d) general description of project; and (e) a detailed description of specialized design and engineering services.
(5)	Block 24: Include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the firms specialized experience.
 For projects performed as a subconsultant or a joint venture (JV) involving different partners, specifically indicate the value of the work performed as a subconsultant or by those firms proposed for this contract, and identify the specific roles and responsibilities performed as a subconsultant or by those firms on the project rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the firms on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

If the firm is a JV, projects performed by the JV should be submitted.  However, if there are no projects performed by the JV, projects may be submitted for each JV partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) relevant projects.
 Failure to submit experience for all JV partners will be evaluated less favorably.

A subconsultants specialized experience will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the JV partner(s).  Prime contractor-sub-contractor/JVs/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects will be considered more favorably than those without such history.



CRITERION 2  KEY PERSONNELS PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE:

Firms will be evaluated for (a) professional qualifications of key personnel proposed for two (2) design teams and, (b) specialized experience in relevant projects.  Submission of relevant projects with more variety of specialized experience and within Hawaii, Guam, Tinian, Diego Garcia, Australia, Japan, Korea, and other Pacific Ocean areas within the NAVFAC area of responsibility will be more favorably considered.
 Specialized experience and a relevant project are defined in Criterion 1.

Submission Requirements:

(a) Professional Qualifications of Key Personnel

SF330, Part I, Section H.  Identify key personnel for two (2) design teams.  Key personnel for each team shall be limited to the following: Principal-in-Charge of the prime AE firm, Prime Electrical Project Manager, Prime Electrical Engineer, Project Architect, Mechanical Project Engineer, Civil Project Engineer, Structural Project Engineer, Fire Protection Project Engineer, Geotechnical Project Engineer, and Cost Estimator.

SF330, Part I, Section E.
 Specialized experience shall be limited to the two (2) Prime Electrical Project Managers.  Specialized experience for other key personnel is not required and if submitted, will not be considered in the evaluation.  Complete Blocks 12 through 18 for all key personnel.  Complete Blocks 12 through 19 for Prime Electrical Project Managers.

Provide a maximum of five (5) relevant projects demonstrating specialized experience.  If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will only evaluate projects up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.  A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an IDIQ contract.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.
 The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract and will only evaluate individual task order information.  Each project shall include project title and location, year completed, brief description, point-of-contact name, email address, phone number, contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance, contract award amount, and the role and experience the Prime Electrical Project Manager had in performing the project.  If a project description does not clearly define the work performed by the Prime Electrical Project Manager, including the specialized experience, or if the project does not provide the requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project may be evaluated less favorably.


CRITERION 3  PAST PERFORMANCE:

Firms will be evaluated for past performance of relevant projects with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.
 Evaluation of past performance will be based upon information provided in CPARS/ACASS or Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) for Criterion 1 relevant projects.  Customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criterion may be used in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:

SF330, Part I, Section H.  Submit a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation for each project submitted for Criterion 1.  If a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation is not available, the PPQ (Attachment A) included in this notice may be submitted.  Do not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS/ACASS is available.

PPQs shall be completed by the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.
 PPQs shall not be completed by the prime contractor on a design-build project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a subcontractor.  Firms may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP as long as it is on the same form posted with this Synopsis.  Firms shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other AE services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

Firms may provide any information on problems encountered and the corrective actions taken on projects submitted under Criterion 1.  Firms may also address any adverse past performance issues.
 Information shall not exceed two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) in total.  If more than two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) are submitted, the Government will only evaluate pages up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.

The Government is not restricted to the information provided by the Firm and may use other sources to assess past performance, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and inquiries with previous customers/owners.  PPIRS will be evaluated for the firm that will perform the work and search will be based upon the CAGE/DUNS number provided for the firm.

Awards, letters of commendation, certificates of appreciation, etc.
shall not be submitted and will not be considered in the evaluation.

A subconsultants past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the JV partner(s).

CRITERION 4  CAPACITY

Firms will be evaluated on the Firms capacity to accomplish the work in the required time and ability to accomplish multiple projects concurrently.

Submission Requirements:

SF330, Part I, Section H.  Address staffing and capacity to accomplish the work under this contract by describing the following: (1) the proposed teams (prime and subconsultants) ability to complete several large task orders concurrently with a quick turnaround; (2) the firms present workload and the availability of the project team (including subconsultants) for the specified contract performance period; (3) the workload and the availability of the key personnel during the anticipated contract performance period; (4) the ability of the firm to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services.

Description shall not exceed two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) in total.
 If more than two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) are submitted, the Government will only evaluate pages up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.

General statements of availability or capacity may be considered less favorably.

CRITERION 5  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN

Firms will be evaluated in terms of their knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts through an integrated design approach and designing in accordance with sustainable design third party certification rating systems (LEED, Green Globes, Guiding Principles Compliance, or equivalent rating systems).

<DESC>This is a synopsis to add items to an existing repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Raytheon Company (072E5). This serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by NAVSUP WSS for the period a five-year period ending on January 25, 2023 for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the items specified within the attached document

The ten (10) items listed on the attachment is subject to the Buy American Act (BAA), which requires delivery of end products of specified countries or as otherwise consistent with the governing statute and implementing regulations. The applicable BAA clauses and certificates will be included in the solicitation and contract.
Other potentially applicable clauses and certificates, for example those governing specialty metals, commercial derivative military articles, and the prohibition against acquiring munitions list items from Communist China military companies, will also be included. No other restrictions (for example, those for clothing, roller bearings, etc.) have been identified as applying to the 10 items.

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.navsup.navy.mil/public/navsup/business_opps/

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE

On behalf of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC), 3350 Illinois Street, Great Lakes, IL, 60088, the Great Lakes Acquisition Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract with Quest Diagnostics for Reference Laboratory Testing Services, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

Services required include the transportation of clinical laboratory specimens to the Contractor s laboratory(s), the performance of analytical testing as defined by the Contractor s reference test manual of approximately 780 different tests, the electronic interface reporting of analytical test results into VA and DOD systems, a specimen processor, and consultative services. The performance period will be 01 March through 31 August 2019.

Quest Diagnostics is the only known contractor that has the current resources (manpower, experience, technical/operational knowledge, interconnection of the two computer systems, VA VISTA and DOD CHCS, and confirmed operational test databases) to perform the critical mission for the short-term contract by 01 March 2019 without interruption. Awarding to any vendor other than Quest Diagnostics would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the FHCC Red Rover Clinic s requirements and the consequences would be detrimental to providing timely patient care and meeting military missions. In order to electronically transmit test results into the two computer systems in use at the FHCC, contractors are required to have an existing interface with the VA and DOD. In addition, any individuals involved in the creation of a test database or specimen processing at the FHCC must have an ANACI Background Investigation initiated prior to accessing the FHCC s computer systems.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511   Medical Laboratories, with a small business size standard of $32.5 million.  

This notice is NOT a request for competitive offers; however, if a vendor feels it can meet the needs of the Government, the following information shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at becky.cincotta@va.gov by Tuesday, February 26 at 3:30 p.m. central.  

Contractor s Test Manual & pricing
Evidence of Insurance 

No telephone responses will be accepted. Information received will be used to determine whether it is in the Government s best interest to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is for the United States Government (USG) to determine the industry capabilities to produce and integrate a MCWS using a XM813 (30x173mm cannon) onto a Stryker DVHA1. PMO SBCT produced a MCWS on a Flat Bottom Hull, as a replacement to the Remote Weapon Station (RWS) currently on the platform in support of an Operational Needs Statement (ONS). The USG is considering the pursuit of a potential future system to be integrated fleet wide on the DVHA1 chassis. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) is currently the prime manufacturer of the Stryker DVHA1 and a complete systems-level Technical Data Package (TDP) is not available.
<p>The MCWS program is pre-decisional. Any information received in response to this survey will be used by the USG to aid its current Stryker Acquisition Planning effort and a potential competitive Request for Proposal (RFP). Currently, the USG plans to obtain the prospective requirements identified within this survey from a source that has the ability or capability to meet the USG's requirements.</p>

<DESC><strong>Description</strong>: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. <br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is developing a new laboratory with state-of-the-art imaging equipment to allow for pioneering research in the relationship between human neurological disorders and brain function at the molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>: The Laboratory of Circuits, Synapses, and Molecular Signaling (LCSMS) requires state-of the-art-imaging equipment to accommodate its research. This laboratory will be overseen by the new Scientific Director, whose space renovation for this equipment is scheduled to be completed by September 2019. The goal of the research is to delve into the relationship between human neurological disorders and brain function at the molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. The LCSMS will include two multiphoton microscopes, both of which will be capable of simultaneous multiphoton imaging and photoactivation (i.e., optogenetic stimulation or neurotransmitter uncaging). For these microscopes, the LCSMS requires two tunable laser systems: one (1) Broadly Tunable Laser (680-1300 nm) and one (1) Tunable Laser (690-1040 nm).<br /><strong><br />Project Requirements</strong>:<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Broadly Tunable Laser (680-1300 nm) - Quantity of 1<br /></span></strong><br />a. Laser must have software-controlled automated tuning across a range of 680-1300 nm with a single output beam across the complete tuning range. <br /><br />b. The two lasers of this purchase description will sit on the same 5' x 10' anti-vibration table, along with two multiphoton microscopes and various equipment for physiological and behavioral experiments. Space is therefore at a premium. The light source system must be contained in a single enclosure no larger than 36" x 24" x 7.5".<br /><br />c. The laser will be shared by two microscopes, making high power imperative. Consequently, the laser shall have the specified average power vs tuning:<br /><br />700 nm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1 W<br />800 nm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1.5 W<br />900 nm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;2 W<br />1000 nm&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1.8 W<br />1100 nm&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1.6 W<br />1200 nm&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1.4 W<br />1300 nm&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;1 W<br /><br />And the laser shall have the specified peak power vs tuning:<br /><br />700 nm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;100 kW<br />900 nm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;200 kW<br />1000 nm&nbsp; &gt;175 kW<br />1200 nm&nbsp; &gt;125 kW<br />1300 nm&nbsp; &gt;100 kW<br /><br />d. Laser system output pulse width must be &lt;120 fs throughout the complete tuning range of 680-1300 nm.<br /><br />e. The laser system must have automated dispersion compensation (pulse width &lt;120 fs) throughout the complete tuning range.<br /><br />f. Synchronization via BNC connection for timing of other experimental equipment is to be standard.<br /><br />g. Beam parameters comparable to the following are desired:<br /><br />&bull; Pulse width: &lt;120 fs at 920 nm <br />&bull; Tuning Speed: 50 nm / sec, full range<br />&bull; Diameter: 1.1 +/- 0.2 mm (900mnm)<br />&bull; Divergence: &lt;1.5 mrad (900 nm)<br />&bull; Polarization: &gt;500:1 (900 nm)<br />&bull; Spatial mode, M-squared:: &lt;1.2 (900 nm)<br />&bull; Roundness: 0.8-1.2 (900 nm)<br />&bull; Noise: &lt;0.5% RMS [10 Hz-10 MHz at 900 nm]<br /><br />h. Laser system shall have an automated software-controlled tuning speed &gt;50 nm/sec as measured over the full tuning range.<br /><br />i. Laser system design shall be capable of providing a second fixed output at ~1045 nm with a power of 3.5 W, which is synchronized to the fully-tunable output with a fixed delay so as to enable dual-wavelength imaging or uncaging.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tunable Laser (690-1040 nm) - Quantity of 1<br /></span></strong><br />a.

<SOLNBR>2019_I-WEPTAC_Industry_Day
<RESPDATE>032219

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: 2019_I-WEPTAC_Industry_Day</p>
<p>The Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC) Commander will host the 3rd Annual Installation and Mission Support Weapons and Tactics Conference (I-WEPTAC) Conference April 8-10, 2019. This conference will focus on the energy and creativity of our young warfighters on the toughest challenges the Air Force is facing in combat support. The theme of the 2019 I-WEPTAC is "The Installation Weapons System in Multi-Domain Operations." This conference will bring together hundreds of warfighters from the Air Force to discuss current and future issues, and provide solutions to potential topic/mission scenarios. The culminating event will be the Final Outbrief which will be presented to the over 50 General Officers and Senior Executive Service Civilians from 1-star to 4-star ranks. In addition, multiple Mission Support Group Commanders and Senior Enlisted Leaders form all Active Duty Air Force Bases will be in attendance along with several hundred attendees from the local Installation and Mission Support Center Staff. A highlight of the conference activities is the chance for these attendees to engage with industry during the 9 April, 2019 Industry Day events.</p>
<p>The mission of AFIMSC is to deliver globally integrated combat support and shape the foundation of America's Air, Space, and Cyberspace power. AFIMSC is one team around the globe revolutionizing combat support. The AFIMSC cross-functional team provides globally integrated management, resourcing and combat support operations for Airman and family services, base communications, chaplain, civil engineering, contracting, logistics readiness, public affairs, security forces and financial management programs.</p>
<p>The topics that will be presented during the conference are: <br />1. Command &amp; Control of the Installation as a Weapons System - Today's Air Force does not possess the doctrine, organizational structure, or standardized and integrated common operating picture to enable command and control of the installation as a weapons system in the current or future fights.<br />Objectives of working group - <br />- Propose Installation C2 doctrine for Annex 3-30<br />- Design organization structure for installation C2<br />- Propose an integrated C2 node<br />- Develop requirements for a common operating picture that will link all requisite elements of operations and installation support to enable decision makers at all levels.</p>
<p>2. Integrating Technology for the Installation We Need - Today's Agile Combat Support (ACS) paradigms lack the technology needed to support tomorrow's Air Force We Need (AFWN).<br />Objectives of working group -<br />- Recommend doctrinal and policy changes to improve acquisition, accountability, and oversight of integrated technology<br />- Mitigate the gap between disparate data sources and decision-makers to enable multi-domain operations against high-end threats<br />- Enhance the support "tail" necessary to enable the operational "tooth" in tomorrow's AFWN<br /><br />3. Integration of Training &amp; Technology Across Multi-Domain Operations - The Air Force lacks comprehensive multi-domain training integrating Mission Support and Operational objectives.<br />Objectives of working group - <br />- Identify a method to validate Mission Support multi-domain tactics and how these tactics directly impact operational execution<br />- Identify a process to compile and distribute mission support operational and tactical friction points<br />- Identify venues for hands on tactical training for the multi-domain force</p>
<p>4. Logistics Under Attack - The Air Force has inadequate contingency plans to identify, respond, recover, and continue to operate through enemy multi-domain attacks on logistics supply systems. <br />Objectives of working group - <br />- Analyze current logistics/mission cyber system vulnerabilities in CDO environment<br />- Identify logistics system requirements to support Dynamic Force Employment (DFE) operations<br />- Evaluate adequacy of logistics lines of communication<br />- Communication/ push vs pull supply systems<br />- Transportation (inter/intra theater)<br />- Specifically logistics/supply chain resiliency and adequacy<br />- Develop solutions/COAs to:<br />- Build logistics system resiliency in DFE ops<br />- Sustain logistics support in CDO<br />- Develop PACE plan for logistics lines of communication</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole-source, fixed price blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with Nikon Inc., 1300 Walt Whitman Road, Melville, NY, 11747-3012 for the purpose of procuring repair services for its existing Nikon, Inc. photographic equipment inventory.
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a large inventory of Nikon Photographic equipment that is maintained by the Operational Projects Unit (OPU), Laboratory Division. The total inventory exceeds a replacement cost of $20,000,000.00. OPU averages one hundred and fifty repairs with Nikon each year. A BPA with Nikon, Inc. would allow OPU a mechanism for acquiring repair services as needed to support the OPU Field Photography Program, OPU forensics cases and to prepare for emergency response missions.</p>
<p>Nikon, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing all of the repair services to the FBI's existing Nikon photographic equipment. All repairs must be performed by an Authorized Repair station to maintain the manufactures warranty. Although Nikon does have Authorized Repair Stations that are independent businesses, Nikon not does not authorize them to repair all of the Nikon equipment such as lenses. Therefore, Nikon is the only vendor that is capable of meeting OPU's requirement for repair services for its entire inventory of Nikon equipment.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Nikon Inc. is the sole source to provide all the required repair services for the FBI's existing inventory of Nikon photographic equipment.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811211 Consumer Electronics Repair and Maintenance.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency/U.S. Fire Administration/National Fire Data Center (DHS/FEMA/USFA/NFDC) intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 6.302) with PG Public Services, LLC (PGPS) located at 2200 North George Mason Drive #766, Arlington, VA 22207.</p>
<p>More than 40 years ago, the 93rd Congress enacted the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-498). This legislation directed the establishment of the agency known as the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA). Among the law's directives was that the "Administrator shall operate, directly or through contracts or grants, an integrated, comprehensive National Fire Data Center (NFDC) for the selection, analysis, publication and dissemination of information related to the prevention, occurrence, control, and results of fires of all types." In the legislation, the following functions of the NFDC were delineated: (1) Provide an accurate nationwide analysis of the fire problem; (2) Identify major problem areas; (3) Assist in setting priorities; (4) Determine possible solutions to problems; and (5) Monitor the progress of programs to reduce fire losses.</p>
<p>To accomplish these functions, the NFDC is directed to gather, analyze, and disseminate information on: (1) The frequency, causes, spread and extinguishment of fires; (2) The number of injuries and deaths resulting from fires as well as their causes and nature; (3) Property losses; (4) Occupational hazards faced by firefighters including the causes of deaths and injuries; (5) All types of firefighter activities, including inspection practices; (6) Technical information related to building construction, fire properties of materials and similar information; (7) Fire prevention and control laws, systems, methods, techniques, and administrative structures used in foreign nations; (8) Causes, behavior and best method of control of other types of fire, including forest fires, brush fires, underground fires, oil blow-out fires and water-borne fires; and (9) Other useful and applicable information.</p>
<p>One of the tools the NFDC established to accomplish its charter was the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). NFIRS was established to collect both data on the fire incident and data on the technical components of the fire itself in an effort to better understand the nature of the national fire problem. NFIRS is a voluntary system, and it includes only those incidents reported to the system by fire departments that report to NFIRS. Therefore, the NFIRS dataset is not based on a statistically selected sample, nor is it a complete count of incidents or casualties.</p>
<p>NFIRS currently receives data from approximately 80 percent of the Nation's fire departments. Participating fire departments report an average of 21,000,000 non-fire incidents and 1,000,000 fire incidents each year. In addition, other organizations, both public and private, collect supplementary fire-related data, conduct independent fire surveys that are separately analyzed, and provide yet another useful analysis of the Nation's fire problem.</p>
<p>Over the years, NFIRS data files have been provided to the public in multiple formats: dBASE (.dbf), Comma Separated Values (.csv) or delimited text (.txt) files. The current file format is delimited text (.txt) and the files are generally queried using SQL, ACCESS, or statistical software packages such as SAS, SPSS or R. The NFIRS is a relational database that requires analysts to link various data modules together based on unique incident id keys in order to analyze the data. For each NFIRS data module, the qualitative data are collected at a very detailed level based on coded values. Because NFIRS consists of a very intricate structure of detailed codes and the fact that it is not based on a statistically selected sample, NFIRS data analysis is very complex and requires extensive knowledge of the system and its data. NFIRS has unique analytic issues that apply only to this system. For these reasons, it takes several years for analysts to learn the complexities of the system. NFIRS data can present analytic challenges for many fire topics studied.</p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of the system, NFIRS has numerous data quality issues that also present additional analytic challenges. NFIRS participation is completely voluntary and data entry is performed by fire departments and personnel that may have limited NFIRS training and system knowledge. Due to this, there are many missing or conflicting values in the data which require the use of sophisticated analytic techniques when analyzing the data. Part of the data analysis includes devising methods to deal with the data quality problems as they arise such as missing and unknown data and invalid values.</p>
<p>With the goal of creating a single, consistent, authoritative source of national summary fire data, the USFA/NFDC determined a need to develop a new, transparent, fire incident estimation methodology using public data sources, along with NFIRS data. As a result, Contract No. GS10F0195X, Task Order No. HSFE20-12-F-0240 and Order No. HSFE20-17-P-0268 were awarded and focused on the task of developing a new fire incident estimation methodology. The data analyses performed as part of these contracts required: (1) analysis of large, relational databases with millions of data records, (2) analysis of databases with a coded variable structure similar to NFIRS (i.e., using qualitative data analysis methods), (3) analysis of data that are not based on a statistically selected sample, (4) analysis of data with various data quality issues common to standard databases used in all national fire data analyses, (5) develop new statistical and analytic methodologies for analyzing fire data, and (6) develop imputation techniques to handle unknown and missing data. It was anticipated that the new methodology would replace the existing one used by the USFA/NFDC to establish national annual fire incident estimates of fires, fire deaths, fire injuries and dollar loss.</p>
<p>The new fire incident estimation methodology will be completed by the end of July, 2019.</p>
<p>The new contract/order is a logical follow-on to work performed under Contract No. GS10F0195X, Task Order No. HSFE20-12-F-0240 and Order No. HSFE20-17-P-0068. The work performed under these past contracts/orders focused on the analyses of fire related incidents. The intent of the upcoming new contract/order is to focus on developing a new non-fire incident estimation methodology with the goal of establishing a new and previously unpublished annual U.S. national estimate of non-fire incidents to which fire departments respond. Non-fire incidents include EMS, EMS/rescue, haz mat, false alarms, service calls, etc.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to meet the core responsibilities for this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>1) analyze large, relational databases with tens of millions of data records,<br />2) analyze databases with a coded variable structure similar to NFIRS (i.e., using qualitative data analysis methods),<br />3) analyze data that are not based on a statistically selected sample,<br />4) analyze data with various data quality issues common to standard databases used in all national fire and non-fire data analyses,<br />5) develop a national non-fire estimation methodology using the national fire estimation methodology developed in the previous contracts/orders as a basis. <br />6) develop new statistical and analytic methodologies for analyzing non-fire data, and<br />7) develop imputation techniques to handle unknown and missing non-fire data.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contractor:</p>
<p>1) personnel must have a minimum of 5 years' experience working with NFIRS data and demonstrate that they have an in-depth knowledge of NFIRS and a deep understanding of how the data can and cannot be used.<br />2) must have a fully developed analytical database consisting of 10 years of National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) data of valid NFIRS incidents.<br />3) must have undertaken an exhaustive literature search in peer-reviewed journals, PhD theses, and published reports to identify factors which may influence outcome of fire or non-fire incidents. <br />4) must have undertaken an exhaustive data sources investigation to identify alternate sources of data for casualties from incidents responded to by fire departments. <br />5) must demonstrate that it understands and can replicate the methodology used by USFA to extract data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality data set.<br />6) must have working data correction models to account for fire departments' incomplete fire or non-fire incident submission. These models must be immediately available to run on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available. <br />7) must have the capability to identify unique NFIRS (fire or non-fire) incidents for analyses and estimates, including mutual aid incidents reported by an aid-giving department for which the aid-receiving department did not participate in NFIRS that year. This capability must be immediately available to be applied on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available.<br />8) must have the capability to account for likely numbers of fire or non-fire incidents in geographic areas where no incident data was submitted to NFIRS. This capability must be immediately available to be applied on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available.<br />9) must be able to account for known fire departments who failed to submit incident data in a given year. This capability must be immediately ready to be applied on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available.<br />10) must have a peer-reviewed paper, suitable for publication that outlines a detailed method for estimating annual fire incidents that may be used as the basis for a method to estimate annual non-fire incidents. <br />11) must have working models to estimate the numbers of casualties from annual fire incidents that may be used as the basis for estimating the numbers of casualties from annual non-fire incidents. These models must be immediately available to run on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available.<br />12) must have working models that identify the key data elements, ancillary data, and their inter-relationships to produce preliminary estimates of the direct dollar loss associated with an incident where appropriate. These models must be immediately available to run on prior year NFIRS data and on the current NFIRS data when that data is available.</p>
<p>Based on the above information, the only company known which can provide technically acceptable services for the National Fire Data Center is PGPS.</p>
<p>PGPS has an in-depth knowledge of the NFIRS system and its data. They have a thorough understanding of how the data can and cannot be applied. They have the ability to: perform data analyses tasks such as analyzing large, relational databases with millions of data records; analyze databases with a coded variable structure similar to NFIRS (i.e., using qualitative data analysis methods); analyze data that are not based on a statistically selected sample; analyze data with various data quality issues common to standard databases used in all national fire data analyses; and most importantly, they have an intimate understanding of the standard national estimates methodologies currently in use by USFA and have been key in developing new national estimates methodologies.</p>
<p>PGPS has demonstrated extensive experience working with NFIRS data; performing data analyses; producing analytic reports and integrated survey sample results that add to the body of knowledge of the fire situation in the U.S.</p>
<p>PGPS has a history of performing comprehensive statistical research and detailed fire data analyses of NFIRS data in conjunction with various other data sources, including but not limited to U.S. Census Bureau data, National Fire Protection Association data, National Center for Health Statistics data, and other data sources.</p>
<p>FEMA has determined that PGPS is uniquely qualified to perform this work, possessing the expertise and qualifications necessary to complete the required tasks. PGPS performed and completed work under Contract No. GS10F0195X, Task Order No. HSFE20-12-F-0240 and Order No. HSFE20-17-P-0268. Based on their innovative proposed approach and proprietary analytical techniques and methods used, the Government has determined PGPS is the only candidate capable of developing the methodology.</p>

<p>Issue Date: 25 FEB 2019 - Closing Date: 08 MAR 2019 - 2:00 PM EST</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for ELECTRONIC WARFARE.</p>
<p>SPECIAL NOTICE - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/Sources Sought:    The Government is issuing this RFI/Sources Sought announcement in order to identify interested parties for the redesign of the Low Noise Oscillator (LNO), P/N 459525-1.  The LNO is a Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) in the Universal Exciter Upgrade (UEU), with the UEU being a Weapon Replaceable Assembly (WRA) in the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS).</p>
<p>This redesign is being undertaken in order to eliminate the use of obsolete parts, and this effort will result in the fielding of a fully qualified, two-way interchangeable, form/fit/function replacement of the current LNO.  This effort includes Design Requirements Definition, Design, Engineering Documentation, Testing, Manufacture of Engineering Development Models (EDMs) &amp; Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Units, and Program Management, inclusive of Program &amp; Engineering Reviews.  Additional details concerning the requirements governing this redesign can be found in the Statement of Work (SOW), which is an available attachment associated with this announcement.</p>
<p>The "Draft" Statement of Work (SOW), is being provided with the issuance of this RFI/Sources Sought announcement for consideration and feedback from Industry to formulate a final SOW for issuance with the RFP. This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate or provide written feedback to the "Draft" Statement of Work will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government requirements to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this full-, free-, and open- competition process or to provide written feedback may result in a future Government Statement of Work and/or specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide services and supplies that meet the Government's requirement may respond.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a "white paper" no longer than 10 pages, and/or other pertinent information.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI/Sources Sought shall include the following:</p>
<p>a.	Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Business Size<br />b.	Company Point of Contact including name, telephone number, and email address.<br />c.	Information describing the Company's capabilities, resources, and experience that demonstrate an ability to perform this redesign effort.<br />d.	Feedback and questions regarding the requirements cited in the SOW.  <br />e.	Descriptions of any preliminary redesign approaches for the LNO, such as whether the design approach should focus only on removing/replacing the obsolete components or whether it would be more prudent to execute a complete redesign of the LNO.  <br />f.	Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to perform this redesign, in accordance with the requirements cited in the SOW.  <br />g.	Estimated time period to complete all aspects of the SOW.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Information (GFI):  The SOW and applicable specifications/documents that are referenced in the SOW, but that are not commercially available, need to be requested by the Contractor.  However, in order for the Government to provide these documents to the Contractor, the Contractor must be registered by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Program (i.e., have a DD 2345 approved by said agency).  Information about the JCP is located at https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx.</p>
<p>Contractors must also be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM).  Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>All information received in response and marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  NSWC Crane makes no implied or in fact contracts by issuing this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NSWC Crane's view of the information received. Do not send any material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or identify information that is business sensitive. Responses to this notice will not be returned. Telephone calls/questions or inquiries will not be accepted. All information provided becomes U.S. Navy property and will not be returned. All proprietary information will be treated appropriately. Your interest in this RFI/Sources Sought announcement is appreciated.</p>
<p>This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>

<br />
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span>The Other Transaction Authority (OTA), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to "carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be carried out by the DoD, or to improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces." </span><span>Constant innovation and rapid technology advances are occurring throughout the world. Partnerships with commercial industry, the civil maritime sector, and others will be used to leverage these approaches and increase flexibility and agility, reduce cost, improve technology and capability insertion, and decrease program development cycles. The </span><span>OTA offers an alternative to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&#8208;based acquisitions, allowing for access to participation by non-traditional defense contractors with innovative solutions that may not normally desire to participate in government procurement. <br /><br /><strong>Requirement</strong><br /><br /></span>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) requires innovative technological solutions to address current and future security threats in the surface and maritime environment. NSWCDD's intent is to competitively establish an Other Transaction (OT) Agreement with a single Consortium, a legal entity whose members will be comprised of both traditional and non-traditional defense contractors. As part of the selection of the single Consortium, the Government will evaluate the Consortium Manager (CM) proposed to manage the operations of the Consortium based on its Consortium Membership Agreement. The Consortium Management Firm will sign the Base OT Agreement on behalf of the Consortium.&nbsp; Prototype projects will be awarded to the CM on behalf of the Consortium member or team proposing the project.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>Objectives of establishing the Base OT Agreement with the CM (on behalf of the Consortium) include: 1) minimizing barriers to entry for small businesses and non-traditional vendors to work with the Government and to identify and realize teaming opportunities among entities to promote integrated research and prototyping efficiencies; 2) facilitating proposal development; and (3) reducing the cost of prototype development.</p>
<br />
<p>Following selection of the Consortium and Consortium Manager by the Government, and upon execution of the Base OT Agreement, the CM will be responsible for further building membership by attracting, retaining, and mentoring members to prepare them to compete for forthcoming prototype projects that will be solicited by NSWC Dahlgren. The CM will also be expected to aid in building teaming arrangements among Consortium members, as needed, to best meet the requirements of individual projects.</p>
<br />
<p>Competing the Base OT Agreement, as well as competing each of the ensuing prototype projects among the consortium membership, will also satisfy the requirements of the authority granted in 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b that permit the streamlining of potential future follow-on production awards resulting from successful prototype projects.</p>

<p><br />The extension will allow the program to build upon the advances made during the previous five years of TEPS interventions to target peace and reconciliation, conflict mitigation and prevention, civil society, good governance, respect for human rights, and grass roots democracy. TEPS' will meet the essential community-level needs and issues of returnees: access to water for drinking and irrigation; food production and access; availability of markets; and livelihoods.</p>
<p>USAID/Sudan intends to negotiate non-competitively with only one source (AECOM International) under the authority of USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) 706.302-70(b)(5) which states that "An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays." The contract was originally awarded to AECOM International, 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 700 Arlington, VA 22201 using full and open competition on September 15, 2014 with a period of performance ending September 14, 2019. The extension will extend the period of performance of the contract by approximately one year from September 15, 2019 to September 14, 2020 and the estimated cost of this extension is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p>Provide your responses NLT 2PM, Mountain Time, 8 March 2019 to william.t.rawe@usace.army.mil. Ensure your response is limited to 5 pages and the Subject Line of your response includes "PLA Survey - Consolidated Space Operations Facility". Please provide your contact information in the body of the email.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 22.503) Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(i) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and</p>
<p>(ii) Be consistent with law. Reference: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Request responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the reference project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>(3) Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would affect the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>(4) Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>(5) Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>(6) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>(7) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>The information gathered in this survey should include the following information on projects completed in the last 2 - 5 years:</p>
<p>1) Project Name and Location<br />2) Detailed Project Description<br />3) Initial Cost Estimate vs. Actual Final Cost<br />4) Was the project completed on time?<br />5) Number of craft trades present on the project<br />6) Was a PLA used?<br />7) Were there any challenges experienced during the project?</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>Design-Bid-Build</p>
<p>Construct a three-story Consolidated Space Operations Facility (16,505 SM) with reinforced concrete foundation, steel structure, clad with precast concrete panels and a low slope membrane roof. Construct a new electrical feeder connecting to the central utility plant and a new buried concrete utilidor connection to support redundant potable water, steam and condensate piping service to the new building. Connect the sanitary wastewater, fire protection, and water service to respective infrastructure. Construct a power generation and steam heat plant adjacent/attached to the CSOF to provide back-up power and HVAC. Construct a one-story entry control facility (595 SM) at the south side of the restricted area with reinforced concrete foundation, steel structure, clad with precast concrete panels, a low slope membrane roof and all necessary utilities and infrastructure along with a south vehicle parking lot. The CSOF must be constructed to meet Protection Level 2 requirements and designed for a future expansion. To ensure reliable operations, the CSOF will have multiple active power and cooling distribution paths and redundant components to meet the fault-tolerant facility "Tier IV" standard as defined by The Uptime Institute. The CSOF will include facilities designed and constructed to the current ICD/ICS 705 standards. The CSOF will also include a dining area (585 SM) to support 24/7 operations.</p>
<p>The estimated construction cost of this project is between $125,000,000 and $140,000,000.</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance is 1,000 calendar days.</p>
<p>Contractors responding to this market survey must submit their responses via e-mail to William Rawe at william.t.rawe@usace.army.mil no later than 2PM Mountain Local Time, Friday, 8 March 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (USACE-HECSA) on behalf of the USACE Institute for Water Resources Risk Management Center (IWR-RMC) intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price supply &amp; service contract to Isograph, Inc. 375 S Main Street, Suite 4, Alpine, UT 84004-2009 (DUNS 008876315; CAGE 1TQN1) for the purchase of Reliability and Availability software licenses for version 13, and maintenance and support services of software licenses. The software has been in placed used nationally since 2006. The Dam and Levee Safety and Asset Management has completed a substantial number of projects relating to flood control, navigation, and hydropower with the analyzed results using tools from the reliability and availability workbench software. The continual updating of files is required after each operation condition assessment, periodic inspection, or assessment. The purchase of software by another manufacturer would require additional training of personnel, conversion time of archived files for project use which will result in a significant increase in the overall cost to the Government. <br /><br />The maintenance support services will provide IWR RMC with upgrades to the Software as upgrades become available. The maintenance support ensures that IWR RMC can continue to use the software per the licensing agreement, and that IWR RMC receives the necessary software upgrades at no additional costs. The statutory authority permitting the acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) citation is 13.106-1(b(1)(i), and the FAR citation title is "Only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, brand name or industrial mobilization)".<br /><br />The IWR RMC has a mission to provide analysis of emerging water resources trends and issues, state-of-the-art planning and hydrologic engineering methods, models and training, and national data management of results-oriented program and project information. IWR RMC currently uses previous version of Isograph Reliability and Availability workbench software. Major version changes have occurred in both programs and the updating of licenses and redistribution of RWB to AWB licenses is critical to maintain and keep up with the continuity of increased usage with the USACE safety programs. <br /><br />This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is for informational purposes only in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.201 and not a request for competitive proposals. Therefore, no solicitation document exists for this requirement. Interested parties should submit a Capability Statement and pricing information for this requirement within fifteen (15) days of public notice to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.<br /><br />Interested contractor shall submit the Capability Statement in response to this Notice of Intent to Sole Source electronically by 10:00 A.M. (EST) 12 March 2019 via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Jessica L. Wright at jessica.l.wright@usace.army.mil.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-70 CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS <br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. <br />(a) Definitions. <br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. <br />(b) Requirements. <br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. <br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. <br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. <br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. <br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. <br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. <br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. <br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. <br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. <br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. <br />For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: <br />&bull; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&bull; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&bull; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&bull; Text: (202) 335-0265 <br />(d) Confidentiality. <br />Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e) Remedies. <br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: <br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>

<p>5.1 Overnight guest Accommodations<br />(Room block held for booking &amp; payment by individual participants) <br />5.2 Meeting Space<br />5.3 Audio Visual Equipment<br />5.4 Food Services</p>
<p>5. QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN:</p>
<p>Note: the following Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is OPM's codification of its method of implementing FAR 37.601, which requires that performance-based contracts or task orders-</p>
<p>a) Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; <br />b) Use measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans; <br />c) Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements; and <br />d) Include performance incentives where appropriate.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete the QASP as part of their proposal. A description of the columns and information to be entered follows below.</p>
<p>We will use the information provided as part of our evaluation of your offer.</p>
<p>(1) Deliverable: One of the deliverables described in the "Deliverables" section above.</p>
<p>(2) Performance Standard: The level of performance which the Government considers acceptable. A good performance standard in general shall:<br />&#61607; Measure important things;<br />&#61607; Be simple, but not too simple;<br />&#61607; Be auditable and capable of validation (quantifiable measures preferred, as they are less subjective);<br />&#61607; Attainable and worth the cost;<br />&#61607; Have a level of detail that corresponds to the intent of the stated measure and expectation;<br />&#61607; Be consistently combined with other measures to reflect corporate priorities; and<br />&#61607; Be controlled by the contractor.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable Quality Level: The range of deviation-if any-in which the Government will consider performance to be acceptable. Each offeror shall propose an Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for each performance standard for each deliverable. If the selected offeror fails to achieve stated AQLs, OPM will reduce the offeror's payment for the services rendered in accordance with the disincentive formula. You shall enter the AQLs for each deliverable in the Performance Requirements Summary Template for each deliverable that has a performance standard.</p>
<p>(4) Monitoring Method<br />(a) This is the method OPM will use to monitor performance and determine the extent to which performance has met the standard. Offerors are encouraged to propose a sound process for verifying the accuracy of performance data on a continuing or recurring basis. Regardless of the method or degree of monitoring, we reserve the right to audit all performance data to independently verify its accuracy.</p>
<p>(b) In general, we prefer monitoring methods that automatically capture measurements as part of the process and do not place a burden on either the offeror or OPM to collect and analyze data.</p>
<p>(5) (a)Your selection of AQLs, will be important to our evaluation. Your response shall specify the proposed method for measuring your performance against each performance standard, which we will compare to relevant industry benchmarks. OPM will provide positive performance evaluation as a non-monetary incentive that is commensurate with performance above the AQL.</p>
<p>Performance Requirement Summary Template</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation competition utilizing FAR Parts 12 and 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />
<p>Please see the attached document for the solicitation, statement of work, and clauses.<br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) invites your company to submit a quote for contractor services for an event to be held in Washington, D.C., in June 2019. Specifically the USCG is looking for conference space, parking spaces, conference A/V equipment, and tea and coffee (light refreshments) services for its 24th Annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit (MMCDS). The MMCDS will attract a large group of counter narcotics professionals from nearly 25 countries. The conference space must be in DC area and must be convenient to lodging locations. The USCG requires meeting/gathering space for presentations, networking, international cooperation discussions, and a social engagement.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all supplies and services for conference space and food services to accommodate approximately 175 attendees, 85 of which are foreign nationals. The contractor shall provide fully furnished conference facilities, including audio/visual equipment, office equipment, Wi-Fi/Internet service, and onsite support. Conference space must be large enough for all attendees as well as translation equipment for the summit (this is not being procured as part of this requirement).</p>
<p>This is a full and open competition.</p>
<p>EVALUATION METHODOLOGY: <br />Quote shall be evaluated on a best value basis. The Government shall evaluate the quotes provided for the best value.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: <br />In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-2(b)(3) the USCG shall not establish a formal evaluation plan or scoring method and quotes may be evaluated comparatively against one another, not just against the standards established in this solicitation. Also in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(a)(2), the relative importance assigned to each factor is not required. The evaluation factors shall not be weighted and the USCG reserves broad discretion in evaluating the quotes; detailed technical evaluations with adjectival ratings shall not be used. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a single contract without clarifications with Offerors, if possible. Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government does reserve the right to conduct clarifications if it is determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government reserves the rights to conduct clarifications with one, some, or all Offerors if the Government determines this to be in the best interest of streamlining this procurement. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities (including minor pricing irregularities) in offers received.</p>
<p>The following shall be considered during the evaluation and are thus the evaluation factors:</p>
<p>A) The location of conference space (must be within the DC area and must be within a convenient location to lodging spaces - this solicitation does not directly solicit for lodging for the conference attendees); <br />B) The available dates of conferences space (the USCG prefers 11-13 June 2019, but shall also accept 18-20 June 2019 or 4-6 June 2019); <br />C) Space and capability considerations (such as the size of the area, parking availability, the A/V equipment, etc., which may include a site visit from the USCG to inspect the conference space); and, <br />D) Price.</p>
<p>Please see the attached document for the solicitation, statement of work, and clauses.<br /><br />RESPONSIBILITY DETERMINATION AND SAM AVAILABILITY:<br />In order to be considered acceptable for award, your company must be listed in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov). Those who provide quotes but are not listed in the System for Award Management shall be considered technically unacceptable and not eligible for award. Please provide your DUNS number in your quote so the Government can confirm your entry in the System for Award Management (as well as other systems [if used, as this shall be optional by the discretion of the Government] such as CPARS to check responsibility). If your company cannot be determined to be responsible then you may not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>QUOTE CONTENTS:</p>
<p>Section 1: Capability Statement or Additional Documentation<br />Your quote shall include content that contain your best quote for providing the services. The USCG shall evaluate the contents in accordance with the above and may visit the site. Enough information must be provided to ensure that your services meet the specifications of the requirement. Please see the attached document for the solicitation, statement of work, and clauses.</p>
<p>Section 2: Price<br />The pricing section shall contain pricing information that clearly breaks down the prices for the service.</p>
<p>UNSUCCESSFUL OFFEROR LETTERS:<br />Unsuccessful offeror letter shall NOT be sent out as a result of this solicitation and award. Your company may request an unsuccessful offeror letter, but must request it in the same email that your company submits quote.</p>
<p>QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br />Please submit your quote to Contracting Officer James Robinson at James.R.Robinson@uscg.mil on or before 3PM ET, on 03/06/2019. This RFQ does not represent authorization to award or to proceed with the subject effort, nor does it represent a promise of future direction to proceed. Offerors are solely responsible for this RFQ's submission costs even if this RFQ is canceled in its entirety and RFQ preparation costs shall not be reimbursed in any way.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:<br />Any questions or concerns regarding any aspect of this RFQ shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, James Robinson, via email at James.R.Robinson@uscg.mil on or before 12PM Noon ET, on 02/28/2018. Questions shall be answered via an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Please see the attached document for the solicitation, statement of work, and clauses.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. <br />Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84 dated Nov 1, 2015. This is a total small business set aside. All responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. Past performance will be considered in the selection of the awarded vendor.
<p>The United States Coast Guard Surface Force Logistics Center has a requirement for the following:<br />SERVICE:</p>
<p>Place and Period of performance: Due to operational security, Location and Dates to be provided upon request</p>
<p><br />Vessel Details:</p>
<p>USCGC BERTHOLF</p>
<p>Description of Problem:</p>
<p>Background. BERTHOLF is experiencing unexpected loss of power on both #1 and #2 SSDGs. #1 SSDG has a long history of dropping power and SFLC continues to troubleshoot to correct the discrepancy, however #2 SSDG has recently began experiencing phantom overspeeds causing it to drop power and secure. Local troubleshooting and maintenance has been expended with OPTESTs ranging in run time from 1 hour to 60 hours while loaded and paralleled. Without a reliable #1 and #2 SSDG, BERTHOLF is relying heavily on the #3 SSDG, which is now a single point of failure and would render BERTHOLF not mission capable. In addition, multiple reliable SSDGs are required for high risk evolutions such as fueling at sea.</p>
<p>Work to be performed:</p>
<p>The scope of this work is on the USCGC BERTHOLF and consists of foreign travel for 4 days of on site tech service along with parts. Tech service will include working alongside CG active duty and civilian personnel while troubleshooting and repairs.<br />If tech is non-English speaking, a translator is required.</p>
<p>The following parts are to be provided and installed:<br />MODEL: 3512B <br />SERIAL NO. NSC00002<br /><br />260-0012 Wiring, GP-Engine, 1 EA<br /><br />2062711 ECM, 1 EA<br /><br />2319999 Power Distribution Box, 1 EA</p>
<p><br />While onboard, along with Coast Guard Subject Matter Expert, Tech is requested to confirm proper wire configuration throughout CAT supported parts (inspecting for Damage, loose connection, chaffing, grounds, shorts, etc.) and install/program newly installed ECM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:</p>
<p>Supervision Quality Assurance<br />Planning Engineering<br />Surveyors Worker Transit Time<br />Material Handling Testing<br />Cleaners Guards<br />Estimating Contract Administration<br />Transportation Drivers Fire Watches</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production <br />functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged <br />directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>

<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making</p>

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

L. 113-235) and its successor provisions in subsequent appropriations acts (and as extended in continuing resolutions)).

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, request for bids or quotations, n</span>or, a promise to issue a solicitation in the future<span lang="EN">. The purpose of this Notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement. Responses to this Notice will assist the Government in determining</span> interest and capability of potential vendors for this type of requirement.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Treasury has announced its intent to develop the next family of US Banknotes. BEP&rsquo;s challenge is to develop a highly producible and highly secure family of notes which performs flawlessly in commerce. A key component of this challenge is the underlying design of the banknote family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BEP&rsquo;s Banknote Design team is comprised of world-class artists with a diverse background in the arts. Each designer has served a 7-year banknote design apprenticeship and is a full-fledged journeymen banknote designer. The BEP is interested in respondents capable of providing a neutral, independent and objective advisory and assistance service, to develop a plan to enhance and optimize the banknote design capability of BEP staff through the development of individualized continuing education plans. Additionally, these potential future requirements would include onsite subject matter expert critique of emerging concepts and designs as BEP moves through the development processes. BEP anticipates the most effective critique team to consist of at least 3 SMEs in the Banknote industry and related processes (i.e., Banknote Engraving, Banknote Manufacturing, Banknote Design, etc.), however, will consider industry input demonstrating capabilities to reach the potential desired result outlined in this document.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Advisory and Assistance services consists of two parts. 1) An individualized continuing education program tailored for each banknote designer and developed in coordination with the individual designer and design manager. This includes peer-to-peer advisory services for each individual designer; and 2) critique services of banknote design as it evolves through the design process. Critique supports the entire design team. It is anticipated that these advisory and assistance support services will deliver an agreed upon plan for each Banknote designer. Additionally, the critiques should be meaningful, informative and promote BEP&rsquo;s goal of aiding in the development of a high quality, highly producible family of notes which meet stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is a request for information only. Do not submit a proposal or quote.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to provide net pen aquaculture facilities for endangered suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls Oregon. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform fabrication, transportation, and installation of net pens in Upper Klamath Lake as defined in the Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.
Project is unrestricted, open to any size business.  Applicable NAICS code is 112519.  The period of performance is for one base year and includes two option years that can be exercised solely at the discretion of the Government. 

The objectives and scope for the associated Performance Work Statement are as follows:

Objectives:  
-	Provide net pen aquaculture infrastructure that can withstand the water quality and weather conditions, including large winter ice flows and low dissolved oxygen, of Upper Klamath Lake, OR according to industry standards for general wear and tear.
-	Design net pens that are congruent with target species biology. 
-       Ensure that the net pen aquaculture facility is congruent with the manufacturers guidelines to ensure liability of the manufacturer in regards to improper construction onsite.
-	Fabrication and onsite construction of net pens will be available and in working order by no later than May 31st, 2019  (unless otherwise agreed upon prior to May 31st, 2019 with the Service).


Scope: 

Base Year:  Design, fabricate, and ensure proper installation of net pens for deployment in Upper Klamath Lake for rearing of endangered Lost River and Shortnose suckers.  Services include design of a facility with a minimum of 4 nets with approximately 3,000 square feet of surface area per net that is in contact with the benthos of Upper Klamath Lake.  The design should be easily scalable with minimal additional infrastructure to include up to 30 nets with approximately 3,000 square feet per net.  The total initial net surface area in contact with the lake benthos should be adequate for stocking 12,000 suckers at a density of one fish per square foot.  The design of all structures and nets will be able to withstand high frequency waves and winter ice flows inherent in Upper Klamath Lake without sustaining damage according to industry standards.  Submersible designs are preferred; however, other designs will be considered if adequate justification is provided. All structures and nets shall be easily accessible for semiannual cleaning and able to withstand additional weight as a result of significant biofouling inherent in Upper Klamath Lake.  The deployment site of all structures and nets will be according to the preference of the Contracting Officer Representative and is tentatively at the Rattlesnake Point site (4220'42.00"N, 12151'31.00"W).  All structures and nets shall be fabricated for deployment in minimum and maximum lake depth according to records initiated in 2005 by the USGS Oregon Water Science Center for Rattlesnake Point (RPT) and which can be found at https://or.water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/grapher/graph_setup.pl?basin_id=ukl&site_id=11505900#step2 .  Additionally, structures and net design will account for potential sinking into the muddy lake bottom by providing methods of recovery in the event of this occurrence, or construction that prevents this possibility.  All nets will be equipped with adequate protection from avian and aquatic predators such as grebes, pelicans, terns, seagulls, cormorants, otters, osprey, eagles, and adult yellow perch as well as other aquatic animals that may damage infrastructure, or nets, such as muskrats.  All structures and nets will be equipped with necessary infrastructure for the placement of aeration equipment sufficient to supply oxygenated water to all nets.  A power source for the operation of electric motors associated with aeration will be included. The power source must be easily removable and transportable for over-wintering of the facility and it must not require more than weekly maintenance.  All nets will have a platform on at least one side of the net for monitoring and access of fish for sampling and release.  Walking platforms shall be at least three and a half feet in width and include one larger platform that is, at minimum, seven and a half feet in width, twelve feet in length, and able to support 3,500 lbs.  The net shall be made of tear resistant material and have a maximum mesh size of 6 millimeters.  Cost analysis and feasibility of net pen size in order to meet the required stocking density and number of individual nets is the responsibility of the manufacturer.

Option Year 1:  Provide all services to fabricate, transport and install up to eight (8) additional Net Pen Aquaculture Facilities for Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls OR in calendar year 2020. Each net pen must have a capacity of 3,000 fish and must comply with the same standards set in the initial contract including ability to withstand lake conditions, aeration supplies, and adequate dock space for housing equipment and handling of fish 

Option Year 2: :Provide all services to fabricate, transport and install up to eight (8) additional Net Pen Aquaculture Facilities for Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls OR in calendar year 2020. Each net pen must have a capacity of 3,000 fish and must comply with the same standards set in the initial contract including ability to withstand lake conditions, aeration supplies, and adequate dock space for housing equipment and handling of fish

Basis for award will be "Trade Off" with award to be made to the offeror who represent the best value to the Government. To be considered responsive, offerors will be asked to submit up to two (2) project projects performed over the last five (5) years (1 page per project limitation) that are similar in nature to the type of work described in the Performance Work Statement to reflect the ability to design, fabricate, install and monitor net pen aquaculture facilities. Offerors will submit a price for the base year line item and each of the option year line items on the bid schedule below.  Experience and price are of equal importance.  The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Determination of value will also include whether the bid includes installation of the net pens by May 31st, 2019.

Solicitation Number 140F0119R0005 with attachments is being posted on or about February 22, 2019 with proposals due by 2 PM PST on March 15, 2019.  Quotes can be emailed directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov. 

No further notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.  To be considered for award, interested contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be completed at this same website.  For technical or contract questions, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser by email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to provide net pen aquaculture facilities for endangered suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls Oregon. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform fabrication, transportation, and installation of net pens in Upper Klamath Lake as defined in the Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.
Project is unrestricted, open to any size business.  Applicable NAICS code is 112519.  The period of performance is for one base year and includes two option years that can be exercised solely at the discretion of the Government. 

The objectives and scope for the associated Performance Work Statement are as follows:

Objectives:  
-	Provide net pen aquaculture infrastructure that can withstand the water quality and weather conditions, including large winter ice flows and low dissolved oxygen, of Upper Klamath Lake, OR according to industry standards for general wear and tear.
-	Design net pens that are congruent with target species biology. 
-       Ensure that the net pen aquaculture facility is congruent with the manufacturers guidelines to ensure liability of the manufacturer in regards to improper construction onsite.
-	Fabrication and onsite construction of net pens will be available and in working order by no later than May 31st, 2019  (unless otherwise agreed upon prior to May 31st, 2019 with the Service).


Scope: 

Base Year:  Design, fabricate, and ensure proper installation of net pens for deployment in Upper Klamath Lake for rearing of endangered Lost River and Shortnose suckers.  Services include design of a facility with a minimum of 4 nets with approximately 3,000 square feet of surface area per net that is in contact with the benthos of Upper Klamath Lake.  The design should be easily scalable with minimal additional infrastructure to include up to 30 nets with approximately 3,000 square feet per net.  The total initial net surface area in contact with the lake benthos should be adequate for stocking 12,000 suckers at a density of one fish per square foot.  The design of all structures and nets will be able to withstand high frequency waves and winter ice flows inherent in Upper Klamath Lake without sustaining damage according to industry standards.  Submersible designs are preferred; however, other designs will be considered if adequate justification is provided. All structures and nets shall be easily accessible for semiannual cleaning and able to withstand additional weight as a result of significant biofouling inherent in Upper Klamath Lake.  The deployment site of all structures and nets will be according to the preference of the Contracting Officer Representative and is tentatively at the Rattlesnake Point site (4220'42.00"N, 12151'31.00"W).  All structures and nets shall be fabricated for deployment in minimum and maximum lake depth according to records initiated in 2005 by the USGS Oregon Water Science Center for Rattlesnake Point (RPT) and which can be found at https://or.water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/grapher/graph_setup.pl?basin_id=ukl&site_id=11505900#step2 .  Additionally, structures and net design will account for potential sinking into the muddy lake bottom by providing methods of recovery in the event of this occurrence, or construction that prevents this possibility.  All nets will be equipped with adequate protection from avian and aquatic predators such as grebes, pelicans, terns, seagulls, cormorants, otters, osprey, eagles, and adult yellow perch as well as other aquatic animals that may damage infrastructure, or nets, such as muskrats.  All structures and nets will be equipped with necessary infrastructure for the placement of aeration equipment sufficient to supply oxygenated water to all nets.  A power source for the operation of electric motors associated with aeration will be included. The power source must be easily removable and transportable for over-wintering of the facility and it must not require more than weekly maintenance.  All nets will have a platform on at least one side of the net for monitoring and access of fish for sampling and release.  Walking platforms shall be at least three and a half feet in width and include one larger platform that is, at minimum, seven and a half feet in width, twelve feet in length, and able to support 3,500 lbs.  The net shall be made of tear resistant material and have a maximum mesh size of 6 millimeters.  Cost analysis and feasibility of net pen size in order to meet the required stocking density and number of individual nets is the responsibility of the manufacturer.

Option Year 1:  Provide all services to fabricate, transport and install up to eight (8) additional Net Pen Aquaculture Facilities for Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls OR in calendar year 2020. Each net pen must have a capacity of 3,000 fish and must comply with the same standards set in the initial contract including ability to withstand lake conditions, aeration supplies, and adequate dock space for housing equipment and handling of fish 

Option Year 2: :Provide all services to fabricate, transport and install up to eight (8) additional Net Pen Aquaculture Facilities for Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls OR in calendar year 2020. Each net pen must have a capacity of 3,000 fish and must comply with the same standards set in the initial contract including ability to withstand lake conditions, aeration supplies, and adequate dock space for housing equipment and handling of fish

Basis for award will be "Trade Off" with award to be made to the offeror who represent the best value to the Government. To be considered responsive, offerors will be asked to submit up to two (2) project projects performed over the last five (5) years (1 page per project limitation) that are similar in nature to the type of work described in the Performance Work Statement to reflect the ability to design, fabricate, install and monitor net pen aquaculture facilities. Offerors will submit a price for the base year line item and each of the option year line items on the bid schedule below.  Experience and price are of equal importance.  The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Determination of value will also include whether the bid includes installation of the net pens by May 31st, 2019.

Solicitation Number 140F0119R0005 with attachments is being posted on or about February 22, 2019 with proposals due by 2 PM PST on March 15, 2019.  Quotes can be emailed directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov. 

No further notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.  To be considered for award, interested contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be completed at this same website.

<DESC><div>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters (HQ) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,&nbsp; and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for professional support services and information technology (IT) support on behalf of the NASA Research and Education Support Services (NRESS) program that supports the Agency&rsquo;s peer review life cycle, in accordance with NRESS program guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Research, technology development, and education program proposals submitted to NASA are customarily peer-reviewed before receiving funding through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or intergovernmental agreements funded by the Aeronautics, Human Exploration, Science, Space, Technology, and Education Mission Directorates.&nbsp; Proposal solicitation mechanisms include NASA Research Announcements (NRAs), Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), and Cooperative Agreement Notices (CANs).&nbsp; The Agency&rsquo;s peer review life cycle, for purposes of NRESS requirements consists of the following general processes:&nbsp; (1) development of solicitations and collection of proposals; (2) competitive peer review of proposals;&nbsp; (3) disposition of proposals following proposal review and prior to award; (4) planning and outreach activities leading to the development of solicitations.&nbsp; NASA selection officials make all decisions about proposals selected for award and authorized NASA procurement and federal assistance personnel with appropriate warrants make all awards.&nbsp; The NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), a web-based information technology system, enables users authorized by NASA to announce research, technology development, and specialized education program opportunities to the public.&nbsp; NSPIRES also enables intramural and extramural researchers and other stakeholders to view announcements and submit electronic proposals.&nbsp; Refer to http://nspires.nasaprs.com for an orientation to the NSPIRES system.&nbsp; NSPIRES also interfaces with the Federal e-government system, grants.gov, and provides proposal data output to various government customers as required.&nbsp; Peer reviews evaluate a proposal&rsquo;s relevance, merit, and cost.&nbsp; Specific peer review methods differ among NASA program offices, and even among disciplines within a given program office.&nbsp; Some offices use standing review committees, ad hoc committees, or a combination of these for individual announcements.&nbsp; Peer reviewers include scientists, engineers, educators, or others from public and private academic institutions, industry, Government laboratories and agencies, and foreign countries.&nbsp; Criteria for selection of peer reviewers include the research that candidates have conducted their publications, knowledge and experience, and their ability to conduct an impartial review.&nbsp; NASA and the contractor supporting the NRESS program maintain databases of discipline experts to facilitate the identification and selection of reviewers.&nbsp; Reviewers are sometimes chosen based on recommendations of former reviewers or other professional colleagues.&nbsp; Part of the IT requirement includes the development and maintenance of reviewer profiles that will be made available to NASA program managers.&nbsp; Proposal reviews by external peers ensures fresh viewpoints, alternative perspectives, and understanding of the state of art.&nbsp; Proposal reviews usually occur at panel meetings (either in person or via video or telecom) and are customarily preceded by reviewers&rsquo; written evaluations (e.g., compiled and stored in the NSPIRES web interface).&nbsp; Panel and sub-panel teams are usually composed of seven to ten specialists in relevant disciplines or sub-disciplines.&nbsp; Rarely a large panel might include up to 40 individuals.&nbsp; All panel proceedings, including findings, opinions, working papers, and recommendations are confidential.&nbsp; A proposal&rsquo;s author never participates in its review or reviews directly competing proposals.&nbsp; All reviewers are screened to ensure that they have no conflict of interest or foreign-national restrictions in the proposals they review.&nbsp; The NRESS contractor will provide professional services that support the Agency&rsquo;s peer review life cycle.&nbsp; Services provided will include supporting the development and announcement of solicitations; and collecting, organizing, compiling, and disseminating proposals to peer reviewers.&nbsp; The contractor will manage the staging of planning, outreach, review, and panel events, lead the evaluation and selection of venues, fulfill participant travel, lodging, and per diem requirements, and reimburse participant expenses.&nbsp; The contractor will provide logistical support to planning meetings and workgroups that fall under the NRESS program, as well as student research/outreach events that are related to NRESS education programs.&nbsp; The contractor will provide and support all electronic tools needed to conduct panel events and support mail-in reviews.&nbsp; The contractor will support all review and panel close-out activities, including supporting the development and dissemination of post-selection communications to proposers, their institutions, and NASA stakeholders.&nbsp; The contractor will maintain records of events, secure proposal databases, and will support data analysis related to proposals, Agency peer review, and selection.&nbsp; The NRESS contractor must be capable of operating, maintaining, and sustaining a highly dependable World Wide Web-based (WWW) system, (NSPIRES), that announces solicitations; collects the electronic Notices of Intent (NOI) and proposals; facilitates online proposal review and evaluation; and processes proposals electronically prior to award.&nbsp; The contractor must also be capable of providing work-flow management support, likely through an existing NASA IT system, that will manage the request, review, and approval of work under the scope of the contract. The contractor will provide comprehensive information technology program management and operations for the system and its interfaces (such as interfaces to grants.gov).&nbsp; Information technology services required will included those related to enhancing or replacing the system in response to functional user requirements or marketplace developments.&nbsp; The contractor will provide user access to account provisioning services; help desk services and related customer support; user training materials; and job aids. The contractor will develop and maintain comprehensive systems documentation, as well as information technology security, appropriate protective controls, and risk management.&nbsp; The contractor will provide for and assure continuous operations in the event of system outages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>Dear Interested Parties,
<p>The United States Agency for International Development in Vietnam (USAID/Vietnam) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year contract for USAID/Vietnam Learns program.</p>
<p>The contract objectives are as follows:<br />&bull;	Strengthen USAID/Vietnam, implementing partners, and local entities'(GVN, local organizations) institutional capacity, particularly in monitoring, evaluation, learning, collaboration and adaptive management, to achieve expected results;<br />&bull;	Deepen use of monitoring, evaluation and other types of data to support learning and improve performance at all levels; and<br />&bull;	Improve coordination, collaboration and learning between USAID/Vietnam staff, Government of Vietnam (GVN), our IPs, and key stakeholders.</p>
<p>The contract will be structured with a set of deliverables identified as core work and specific assignments assigned through a job order system.</p>
<p>The requirements of this contract envision that the contractor becomes an integral part of the Mission's program office, including participating heavily in designs, assessments, and evaluations, as well as providing general and targeted support to technical offices.  Given the requirements, there is a significant potential for organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) to arise.  USAID has analyzed the potential OCIs and is resolving them by taking the following actions:<br />(i)	Standard contract clauses that are in the ADS will be included in the contract award.  <br />(ii)	Offerors in the competitive range, or the apparently successful offeror should there be no competitive range, will be required to submit an OCI mitigation plan addressing access to nonpublic information and, if needed, impaired objectivity OCIs.  Only offerors who are in a potential position of evaluating themselves will be required to address impaired objectivity OCIs.&nbsp; Initial mitigation plans must contain general measures and information to address unequal access to nonpublic information at the subcontractor level and may be amended as necessary for particular situations. &nbsp;<br />(iii)	Specific language will be added to the solicitation and resultant contract clarifying that due to the nature of the work, the contractor is precluded from all future activities from the Mission during the life of the contract with the exception of the follow-on contract.&nbsp; This does not automatically flow down to subcontractors and the specific work subcontractors perform will be analyzed for OCIs at that time<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #222222; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
<p>These requirements will not change in the RFP.</p>
<p>The RFP will be released electronically in approximately two weeks on www.fbo.gov.   The solicitation will utilize a Statement of Objectives, with offerors provided the Performance Work Statement and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans as part of the proposal.  USAID/Vietnam will host a pre-proposal conference for the solicitation on/about March 8, 2019 in Hanoi.  Further details of the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP and/or award a contract.  This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.2.  If a solicitation is issued, all necessary information will be supplied at the time it is posted at www.fbo.gov, and information may be different than what is noted above.  Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance.  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website and solicitation number for updates concerning this procurement.</p>
<p><br />Sincerely,</p>
<p>/s/</p>
<p>Michael Capobianco<br />Contracting Officer</p>

<DESC><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose: This RFI is for research purposes. All responses will be reviewed by Government personnel to determine confidence in a carrier's capability to provide the services required. The information requested will be used internally within USTRANSCOM to facilitate decision making, and will not be disclosed outside the agency.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposal/Quote (RFP/RFQ) or solicitation of any kind. USTRANSCOM is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals for this requirement. This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not take any action. Please note that USTRANSCOM will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Background/Description: USTRANSCOM Defense Courier Division (DCD) requires air transportation via commercial scheduled service routes to augment its global transportation network. The DCD will use a system of travel and recovery couriers to monitor courier material transported over commercial air routes. Two DoD travel couriers will transport material to planeside and monitor the material until it is loaded and aircraft doors are sealed. The DoD travel couriers will then board the aircraft transporting the material. Two DoD recovery couriers will be escorted at destination to pre-stage and meet inbound aircraft planeside to observe the aircraft cargo doors being unsealed and material offloading. Recovery couriers may accept the material planeside and conduct a piece count.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide passenger seats for two (2) travel couriers with personal carry-on baggage and cargo rier materials as described in this PWS.&nbsp; Service will be within the Continental United States (CONUS) and between CONUS and Alaska and Hawaii. <br /><br />SEE ATTACHED RFI &amp; DRAFT PWS.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Underwater Explosions Research Division (UERD) has performed an analysis to determine the environments of Naval Information Warfare Center - Pacific (formerlySSC Pacific) antennas/units located on the main mast of CVN-78 USS Gerald R. Ford Class Aircraft Carriers. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that all of the antennas, with one exception, and an infrared beacon must be shock tested on a specific type of shock machine that is capable of achieving the low frequencies, high velocities, and large displacements presented by the mast environment, as determined by UERD. These machines are the Large-Displacement Shock Simulator (LDSS) Shock Machines. The exception is one antenna, the AS-142, which is deck-mounted on the ship, and shall be tested on the Deck Simulator Shock Machine (DSSM).
