The responsible offerors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) database (available at: http://orca.bpn.gov/) system per FAR 52.212-3, and submit a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quote. Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1.

<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>

Salmon River Heritage Project Presolicitation

Description

The contract will require one primary cultural resource task involving the updating/re-recording of previously recorded archaeological/historical sites along the Wild and Scenic river corridor of the Salmon River.  All sites will be recorded on State of Idaho site forms and evaluated for their National Register eligibility.  The results of this field work will be included in a professional report (one for each task order issued) summarizing all aspects of field work, findings, and relevance for greater archaeological interpretation/association and scientific understanding.  No archaeological excavation is allowed under this contract.  

We anticipate award of an IDIQ contract in 2010 with renewal options for 2011 and 2012.  For 2010 we anticipate that 15 sites will be updated/re-recorded.  The Salmon River Wild and Scenic river corridor is 1/2 mile wide (1/4 mile on each side of the river).  Access to this corridor and related sites are generally achieved via the use of jet boat.  The Mackay Bar road will, however, allow vehicle access to the central area of the IDIQ corridor along the right bank of the Salmon River.  The pack bridge across the Salmon River near Mackay Bar will also allow foot-travel to certain areas along the left bank of the Salmon River.

<DESC>Background:
<p>Ship Class is the USNS SUPPLY T-AOE 6. Consisting of four recently acquired USN fast supply ships, this class was designed and built in the 1980's and 1990's and will be used in their present configuration until a special CIVMOD period commences for each vessel. At that time, the ships, along with the existing machinery central control system (MCCS) system, will be modified and upgraded to extend the life of the vessels and to accommodate the leaner crew required to man the ships.</p>
<p>Military Sealift Command (MSC) technical and fleet support offices are in the process of planning and developing for an upgrade in a ship's control system. In addition to the ship's control system upgrade, certain subordinate auxiliary systems require upgrade to match the new digital control system performance, including the RRG Lubeoil Service Pump.</p>
<p>Magnetic relay controllers for the two-speed RRG Lubeoil service pumps have proven to be unreliable. Several controller casualties have been experienced which required contactor rebuilds. Contacts have severely degraded on two separate casualty report (CASREP). This has lead to welding of contacts, increased amperage loading, and Group Control Center (GCC) Automatic Bus Transfer (ABT) failure. These controllers are to be upgraded or replaced utilizing PLC technology.</p>
<p>These motor driven RRG Lubeoil service pumps shall have their PLCs programmed to operate when the vessel is underway until the manually shaft-attached main lube oil service pumps are fully on-line. When these attached main lube oil service pumps are fully on-line, the PLC logic shall be required to shut down the motor driven RRG Lubeoil service pumps. PLC programming shall also operate when the attached main lube oil service pumps begin to come off-line, the PLC logic shall start up and control the motor driven RRG Lubeoil service pumps. In order to support new PLC logic, new sensing systems (sensors, sensor lines) will need to be designed and installed.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>MSC requires Contractor support to select bus transfer switches and contactors for the subject pump system aboard the four T-AOE 6 Class ships as well as develop a work package to replace the existing LO pump control system with the newly identified system.</p>

The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award the MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) canister production contract for MK 15 MOD 1 (FY10-FY12) canisters, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment in support of US Navy requirements on a sole source basis to BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P., U.S. Combat Systems, 4800 East River Road, Minneapolis, MN 55421-1402.  BAE Systems is the only firm with the requisite expertise, knowledge, experience and facilities necessary for MK 41 VLS canister production because they have extensive technical expertise in the areas of canister (and associated hardware) mechanical design, development, and production to satisfy the Navy's requirements.  The anticipated contract period of performance for this requirement will be from date of contract award, estimated 29 October 2010, through delivery of all hardware and services.  BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P., U.S. Combat Systems is the prime contractor for producing MK 41 VLS canisters and associated equipment and companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P., U.S. Combat Systems directly.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Under the Health Care Reform Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted March, 2010, behavioral health providers face a broad range of business improvement challenges, including expanding access to Medicaid populations, contracting with Medicaid and other 3rd party payers, and integrating services with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and other primary care providers.  

SAMHSA/CSAT is committed to improving the business practices of behavioral health treatment providers as a means of reducing costs and increasing client access and continuation in treatment across different levels and systems of care.

Currently, over 1400 substance abuse treatment organizations and 35 Single State Authorities across the country are implementing process improvement practices.

The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) was established by CSAT and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in 2003 and it has evolved into a national organization that provides training and networking opportunities to a broad range of substance abuse and mental health treatment providers, fiscal intermediaries and single state authorities across the country

The objective of this requirement is to improve the business skills of public sector substance abuse and mental health treatment providers who are facing severe budget challenges as they implement the requirements of health care reform.  The contractor will identify and actively recruit treatment providers to participate in learning collaboratives that will include tutorial teleconferences, webinars and other distance learning programs on how to improve the business case in substance abuse treatment.  In addition, the contractor will provide on line training support to participants through use of business case best practices and related process improvement resources.  

Tasks:
Objective 1:	Develop an Implementation Work Plan

Objective 2: 	Recruit Campaign II Participants

Objective 3:	Identify and Disseminate Business Improvement Resources and/or Best Practices 
	
Objective 4: 	Implement a web-based learning collaborative program
		
Objective 5:   Final Summary Report  

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Mid-Atlantic Region, has a need for professional services and Tier Certification for the Social Security Administration National Support Center.  These services include consulting support in reviewing the program of requirements, design documents and construction of the new data center facility.  Certification in accordance with the Uptime Tier Classification System is also required within this scope.

GSA intends to award a sole source contract to Uptime Institute Professional Services, 20 West 37th Street, Floor 6, New York, New York, 10018-7368 to provide these services under the authority of FAR 13.501(a), Test Program for Commercial Items.
The Uptime Institute Professional Services is the only firm licensed to rate and certify the Uptime Institutes Tier Classification system.  Therefore, it is essential to include the Uptime Institute Professional Services during design development for consulting services and design progress reviews, as well as provide Tier Certification to the design documents.  Tier Certification of the design documents is a prerequisite for the Tier Certification of the constructed facility.  The Uptime Institute Professional Services will also be required to provide this Tier Certification for the constructed facility.  No other firm can provide Uptime Tier Certification.  The Uptime Institute developed the Tier Classification System and is the only firm that may provide the certification.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing or by email to Daria Giannotti, daria.giannotti@gsa.gov.

The Government intends to negotiate a ten (10) year, five (5) year firm lease at this location at the same square footage based on economic advantage, agency mission, and other factors. The Government will only consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.

<DESC>The A/E firm shall, in collaboration with VA staff, accomplish Contract Drawings and Specifications, and provide Construction Period Services to expand Outpatient Mental Health Services by adding a 3rd floor (approximately 11,000 gsf) at the 2nd floor level over the South Wing addition (currently under construction), Overton Brooks VA Medical Center, Shreveport, Louisiana.  Additionally, this contract shall include the design to install two elevators and extend the elevator shaft for the 2nd floor floor level up to the 9th floor for a total of 10 stops (Basement through the 9th floor) and site improvements for the south wing. 

This design effort shall also include an electrical coordination study of the existing primary electrical distribution for the south wing addition and all other loads on this primary feed.  Develop a plan on how the power requirements for the south wing addition (all 6 floors and elevators up to the 9th floor) will be met.  This electrical coordination study shall include, but not limited to, the development of an accurate one-line diagram of the primary electrical system, calculating line loading and sizes, and calculating short circuit currents at major points. The study information should include at the least, a one line diagram, fusing information, current loading and available short circuit currents, and plan for adjusting the current feeder as floors are added to the south wing. 

The design shall be in accordance with the VA Space Planning Criteria for these functions.  The AE shall collaborate with the VA Staff to develop a "final" space program for design of the new addition.  

The VA will provide the current construction drawings for the first two floors and elevator shaft (Basement and 1st floor) currently under construction.  The project currently under construction was designed structurally to provide for 4 more additional floors (total Basement through 5th floor) and to take the elevator up to the 9th floor.  This design project will only design for one more floor (2nd floor), but likewise provide for a future expansion of 3 more floors (3rd, 4th & 5th Floors).  The architecture of this 3rd floor addition shall match the first two floors.  

AE shall perform design site visits, testing, borings, design review meetings, etc. as needed to accomplish and facilitate each phase of the design.  The AE shall incorporate the requirements of all applicable codes, including but not limited to, Fire & Life Safety, ADA, National Electric Code, International Plumbing Code, VA HVAC Design Guidance, and other applicable VA Design and/or Construction Guidelines into the design of this project.  

The A/E shall be responsible for designing to achieve sustainable design equivalencies and for implementing within the design the following Guiding Principles found in the Federal Leadership on High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding and the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual:  1. Employ Integrated Design Principles (Integrated Design, Commissioning), 2. Optimize Energy Performance (Energy Efficiency, Measurement and Verification), 3. Protect and Conserve Water (Indoor Water, Outdoor Water), 4. Enhance Indoor Environmental Quality (Ventilation, Thermal Comfort, Moisture Control, Daylighting, Low-Emitting Materials, Protect IAQ during Construction), 5. Reduce Environmental Impact of Materials (Recycled Content, Biobased Content, Construction Waste, Ozone Depleting Compounds).   Sustainable design features, activities and equivalencies are part of overall Federal policy to limit environmental impact and ensure the environmental compatibility of Federal facilities. It is the intent of the VA to make every reasonable and rational effort to meet these requirements. In the event the A/E concludes that implementation of specific sustainability requirements is not feasible (in that doing so creates major negative impacts on the project, including major overall cost increases, major operational feasibility issues, major technology application issues, etc.), a detailed rationale for limiting the use of the specific sustainability feature in question shall be submitted in writing to the Project Engineer for consideration. Such rationale shall include discussion of the significant negative impacts to the project. Cost comparisons and evaluations used in supporting the non-inclusion of required sustainability features must show an overwhelming life cycle rationale. Such exclusions shall not be implemented unless specifically approved by the Project Engineer.

AE shall also incorporate into the design construction bid alternates identified during the design process.  Also identify in the design any phasing required to facilitate construction.  Additionally, the A/E firm shall have the plans and specifications reviewed and certified by a registered Fire Protection Engineer as being in compliance with the current Life Safety Code (LSC) and applicable National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes.  The final cost estimate shall utilize pricing and format established by RS Means CostWorks "Facility Construction Data", most current edition.  Also provide a detailed submittal register for the final design.

The solicitation is to be issued as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Small Business Set-Aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541310.  This Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 Million dollars average annual gross revenues for the past three fiscal years.  This information is only used for classification purposes in the representation and certification portion of the Request for Proposal (RFP).

In accordance with VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern agrees that, in the performance of the contract, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  The A/E must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and VetBiz databases.  A/E firms can obtain CCR information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  VetBiz information for registration and confirmation in website can be found at http://www.vip/vetbiz.gov. A/E is also required to submit Annual Representations and Certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov.  
To register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in your CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in contest of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions, and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.  

Firms interested in being considered for this project are to submit their completed SF 330 electronically (copy attached) to Carolyn.Lee3@va.gov no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on June 29, 2010.

<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB issues this Sources Sought Synopsis for information only to locate sources who are capable. MacDill AFB has a requirement for the purchase of a brand name or equal PCMCIA Personal Data Controller II Cards with ancilliary equipment of the ViaSat Brand.&nbsp;
<p>The below salient characteristics MUST be met for any or equal product being quoted:<br /><br />GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS-<br />Operating Modes: Half-duplex, full-duplex, simplex-<br />Channel Rate: Up to 128 kbps-<br />Channel Types: Wireless or wired-<br />Network Size: Up to 64 users per channel-<br />Message Connectivity: Point-to-point, multicast, broadcast <br />Channel Access: CSMA, Instant-On, Shared-</p>
<p>INTERFACES-<br />Data Interface: PC Card Standard Release 8-<br />DCE Interface: MIL-STD-188-114A compatible (balanced or-unbalanced) and RS232 compatible,-75 bps-128 kbps, synchronous-</p>
<p>COMPATIBILITY-<br />Computers Supported: All PCMCIA Type II PCs-<br />Operating Systems: DOS, Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, 98, 2000-and Windows NT4* and Pocket PC-*Operation under Windows NT4 requires Touchstone-Cardware card and support software-</p>
<p>POWER-<br />DC Input Voltage: 5V or 3.3V (supplied by host)-<br />Consumption: 200mA (approx.)-</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL-<br />Operation Temperature*: -20&deg; C to 70&deg; C-<br />Storage Temperature*: -40&deg; C to 80&deg; C-</p>
<p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS-<br />Dimensions (WDH): 2.125 x 3.375 x 0.187 in. (55 x 186 x 5 mm) without cable-<br />Weight 5: oz-</p>
<p>GIG &amp; Internet Connectivity to the Last Tactical Mile-Run net-centric web applications over your existing combat net radio with the ViaSat VDC-600 Data Controller. Featuring a credit card-sized PCMCIA form factor, the VDC-600 works with any tactical radio to deliver the Common Operating Picture - even over severely degraded radio channels. Take this highly portable ViaSat Data Controller (VDC) anywhere to send error-free data and employ TCP/IP services over existing radios, creating-network-centric connections that link warfighters on the-tactical edge to the Global Information Grid (GIG).-Using a combat net radio, computer, and Data Controller,-you can run IP-based critical combat communications-applications such as Cursor-on-Target, Situational Awareness,-Blue Force Tracking, whiteboard collaboration, chat,-messaging, and email.-</p>
<p>Single, TYPE II PCMCIA Card (3.3V OR 5V) --No external power supply needed-The VDC-600 is a type II card that complies with PC Card-Standard Release 8 for compatibility with the latest mobile PCs.-The advanced design of this PCMCIA card draws less than 750mW of power from the PC, requiring no external power supply-or additional batteries. The VDC-600 is field-proven to operate over a variety of noisy radio channels, including UHF SatCom,-UHF line-of-sight, VHF, HF, Inmarsat, and wireline channels.-The Data Controller supports networks of up to 64 users per channel with point-to-point, multicast, and broadcast messages.-This PC card is fully compliant with MIL-STD-188- 184, meets NDI and COTS requirements, and is backwards compatible with all ViaSat Data Controllers and Data Terminal Software. The VDC-600 also works with MIL-STD-188-220 software.-In a PC card form factor, the VDC-600 delivers the Common Operating Picture and IP connectivity over your existing combat net radio.-ER</p>
<p>Real-time Data Compression - Reduces message size by 50%-The VDC-600 uses data compression to reduce the size of user-messages and shorten transmission times. Data from the user-is automatically compressed before transmission and restored-at the receiving end. The data compression algorithm typically-shrinks text files to less than 50% of their original size. It even-detects "incompressible" user data and sends it unaltered.</p>
<p>Enhanced Error Correction - Quick transfer, even-with poor channel-A combination of Forward Error Correction (FEC) and-Automatic Request for retransmission (ARQ) with a unique application-of diversity combining, transfers user data as quickly-as possible. These powerful error correction techniques send-data over poor quality channels with bit error rates in excess of-15%, as long as the radios are able to perform. The VDC-600-adapts the amount of FEC overhead to optimize throughput-and reduce airtime, and minimizing channel loading.</p>
<p>Built-in Networking with Multicast addressing-Messages can be addressed to a single destination or multicast,-with acknowledgements automatically collected and displayed-by the originating terminal.-</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is an advance notice for information and planning purposes only and is not a solicitation.

<DESC>Market Survey for Small Arms Zeroing System (SAZS)

The U.S. Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, on behalf of the U.S. Army ARDEC (Armament Research Development Engineering Center), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for Small Arms Zeroing System (SAZS). This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI) and the opportunity to obtain performance data of a companys Small Arms Zeroing System by performing lab test and soldier in the loop testing of any sample SAZS submitted. The purpose of this synopsis is to ascertain the performance capability, system technical maturity, user ease of operation and readiness for production of a Small Arms Zeroing System (SAZS). Response is requested from vendors that can function as a prime contractor, and or manufacturer. 

This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract (see FAR 15.201(e). This Market Research , RFI and submitted samples are for SAZS performance analysis and planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. The Government will not reimburse respondents for information solicited. and for any samples submitted for testing. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.

BACKGROUND: 

The U.S. War fighter requires an easy to use method to rapidly, accurately, requiring limited training, and can passively zero his weapon.  Historically, the Army has fielded the M30 Bore sighting Equipment for this purpose, a dry zeroing device which interfaces with the bore of the weapon and provides a collimated reticle which can be used as a zero reference.  The SAZS is a similar system, but designed specifically to provide a zero for the M150 Rifle Combat Optic and M68 Close Combat Optic mounted on a 5.56mm M4 weapon.




SYSTEM Definition:

The SAZS consists of an optical collimator and reticle; method of attachment to the weapon system to be bore sighted; all components required for installation and use; commercial literature (operator and maintenance manual); and a protective carrying case. The SAZS will meet the following key performance objectives:

	It shall be capable of providing a repeatable weapon zero to within one minute of arc (1 MOA).
	It shall require no special tools for installation and use.
	It shall not use batteries of any kind.	It shall be compliant with Mil-Std-810-G survivability standards.
	It shall have a single configuration compatible with  M4.	It shall be able to zero a M68-CCO and a M150-ACOG.	It is preferred to be a one part device, and not require any assembly.

OBJECTIVE: 

Currently, the Warfighter has no method to rapidly zero or confirm zero.  The intent of this RFI is to understand industrys capability to provide a lightweight, accurate collimator for small arms zeroing applications and to establish a list of known sources of such hardware.  Respondents to this solicitation are requested to provide any performance test data, reports, analysis and samples for evaluation.  The Government will evaluate the data provided and assess the samples quantitatively based on the following criteria:  size, weight, accuracy of zero, zero repeatability, degree of collimation,  parallax, and soldier usability. The government intends on performing lab accuracy testing, and soldier in the loop testing in the field.  If  the contractor so request, these samples will be return following completion of characterization of the sample.  

RESPONSES:

 Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages and should be Office 2007 compatible. If any of the material provided contains proprietary information, then mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned). Responses should include, but are not limited to the following:
 	Performance Data
	Test Reports
	Several Samples for testing
	Company History in designing, producing and delivering systems similar in scope and complexity to the Small Arms Zeroing System (SAZS).

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Responses to the RFI must be received no later than 3:00 PM CST on 2 July, 2010 both electronically and in hardcopy format. Hardcopy submissions shall consist of one original and two copies, referencing
 Market Survey # W15QKN-10-X-0457.

Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number, e-mail address, and type of business (Small Business, Large Business, 8a Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Small Business).  Any pricing data, if available, should be sent at no cost to the U.S. Government.

The POC for this action is Kenneth Beatty, Contract Specialist, US Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, CCJM-SW, BLDG. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, HARD COPIES must be provided and sent to the address above along with Electronic Submittals to be sent to:  ken.beatty@us.army.mil

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Joint Armaments Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.  07806-5000, is conducting a Market Research/Sources Sought Notice to locate firms capable of providing Pressure Sensor Mapping Technology and Associated Support.   The period of performance will be eighty (80) weeks from date of award.  The Contract type shall be a Commercial Firm Fixed Price Service contract.The purpose of this effort is to obtain a commercially available pressure mapping sensor technology to function in conjunction with an ARDEC designed test apparatus.  This effort will improve existing pressure sensing technology for use in measuring and assessing the impact pressure over time on a surface simulating body for Non-Lethal (NL) projectiles of various sizes and velocities.  Once the technology is defined, a system that utilizes the technology shall be obtained as well as an assessment of the support required to operate and maintain the system and associated training.   Currently, the M1006 NL Sponge Grenade, the M1029 40mm NL Crowd Dispersal Cartridge and other NL munitions are qualified and tested through the use of a modified clay block test described in the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard 0101.04. The test is very cumbersome to perform and can add excessive time, effort, and cost to qualify or accept lots of NL ammunition.  The accuracy and measurement techniques for clay block testing have also shown to be subjective.   Section 5.4 of the NIJ Standard #0101.04 states The use of clay backing material and the subsequent backface signature depth measurement does not reflect, represent, replicate, or duplicate the physical characteristics of the human torso or its physical response to this type of stimulus.  As a result, the Government seeks to replace this test using pressure mapping technology in an affordable, robust, and uncomplicated test.  All interested companies are invited to provide their capabilities and qualifications regarding the above stated requirement via email (1-2 page limit) to the email point of contact listed below; information provided will not be returned.  Responses shall indicate the size of the business entity (large or small); a copy of the most recent ORCA Certifications.  Please provide the name and address of your company, a point of contact (POC), phone and fax number where they can be reached and an email address.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept questions via email ONLY.  Interested companies are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification NO LATER THAN JUNE 25, 2010.  The point of contact for this action is Carol Yanavok, Contract Specialist, CCJM-JA, 973.724.2623, email:  carol.yanavok@us.army.mil  
This is a Sources Sought/Market Survey Announcement and submissions will be used for informational and planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), nor is the Government obligated to issue a formal RFP/RFQ.  In addition, the Government does not intend to reimburse or pay for any information provided under this notice.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Woundcare, General (Sponges). 

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. 
   
Point of Contact Jim Quinn, 210-316-9827, jquinn8@live.com (preferred) or james.quinn@gdit.com (secondary)

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses (in Microsoft Word or PDF document) to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFRIAQ) will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  Emails and correspondence may be sent to jquinn8@live.com

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing at the conclusion of this process.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Woundcare, General (Sponges). A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the following products listed:  (a) All Purpose Sponges (sterile & non-sterile, cotton & synthetic, regular weave & fine mesh); (b) Bandage Gauze (sterile & non-sterile, cotton & synthetic, regular weave & fine mesh); (c) Sponge Gauze, Bulk 2x2s; 4x4s; 4x8s
Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (in electronic format)   in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Woundcare, General (Sponges) product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy (in electronic format) with the initial submittal responding to this RFRIAQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide customer service (telephonic, onsite, website or email) for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.
10.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format 


Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the TRBO office, on behalf of the CPT, will request product samples and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products listed:  (a) All Purpose Sponges (sterile & non-sterile, cotton & synthetic, regular weave & fine mesh); (b) Bandage Gauze (sterile & non-sterile, cotton & synthetic, regular weave & fine mesh); (c) Sponge Gauze, Bulk 2x2s; 4x4s; 4x8s

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	Sponges may be cut to the desired shape without shredding/unraveling (to prevent introducing debris).
2.	Sponges are highly absorbent (designed to transfer exudate from wound)
3.	Products are low linting/free of foreign particles (to prevent introducing debris)

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS July 2, 2010 4PM EST.

<DESC>&nbsp; The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) is contemplating award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract to a highly qualified HubZone small business concern or, in the event two or more HubZone small businesses do not express an interest, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). In accordance with FAR Part 19, there must be a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible HubZone firms, or SDVOSB firms, will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to determine the interest and capability of potentially qualified HubZone or SDVOSB firms registered in the Central Contractor Registration database under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541430, Graphic Design Services. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice the NETC Contracting Officer will determine if this requirement will be set-aside for Small Business Administration (SBA) Certified HubZone Small Business Concerns in accordance with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 19.1305 or, if the requirements of FAR 19.1305 cannot be met, the requirement will be offered to eligible Service Disabled Veteran owned small businesses (SDVSOB) in accordance with the requirements of FAR 19.1405. In the event that neither the requirements of FAR 19.1305 nor those of FAR 19.1405 are met, the requirement may be procured using another procurement method authorized under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>The primary services to be performed are on-site or off-site functional resources to provide the NETC Media Productions Center, graphic design services.. The contractor must demonstrate a strong operating knowledge of personal computer (PC) based design and peripherals, to include color lasers printers, color plotters, scanners, digital and video cameras, laminators, Web page design, video/audio editing, mechanical layout, typography, quality control and display/exhibit art production. The contractor must also be proficient with current software packages including Adobe CS4 (In Design, Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, After Effects, Premiere Pro and Flash) and digital video editing software, as well as Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access), HTML, and multimedia development programs. In addition to the required knowledge/proficiency stated above, the contractor will be required to perform the following work: Create color brochures, exhibits, web pages, animated video clips, event photography, 3D models and other informational, instructional and marketing products. They will be required to make selections of photographs, art elements or other visual materials to be used in designing printed items and display art. Design work includes such factors as overall dimensions, including reduction and enlargement, color, typography and developing theme related items.</p>
<p>The contractor will also be responsible for developing ideas for the proposed concepts and use good judgment and visual effects in presenting the information. Effective use of media is necessary to have a dramatic impact on overall design to achieve the highest degree of visual effect. The contractor will be required to use the most effective visual mediums and provide advice and assistance to NETC customers on specific layouts or displays and maintain and gather resources to support presentations and other graphics requirements. The contractor must demonstrate a strong knowledge of the graphics and Media industry, e.g., its structure, practices, and major manufacturers.</p>
<p>The work may be performed at the NETC, located in Emmitsburg, Maryland, Frederick County, or at the contractor's location, provided all delivery schedules can be met including short turn around requirements. Workstations and most production equipment will be provided on-site if the work is performed at the NETC. If work is performed at the contractor's location, no government furnished equipment/property will be provided. The contractor will provide workstations/equipment for work performed at the contractor's location. The NETC is located in Census Tract "24021753200" which IS NOT HubZone qualified. Our intent, subject to change, is to issue a single contract containing a base period with 4 option periods. The government reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to decline to exercise option periods.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.1305, SBA Certified HubZone small Business concerns will be given first consideration with regard to this requirement. This sources sought is for market research and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the reviews. All information submitted in response to this announcement must be received on or before the closing date.</p>

<DESC>Section 1605 of the ARRA requires that none of the appropriated funds may be used for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or a public works project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project is produced in the United States, or unless a waiver is provided to the recipient by the head of the appropriate agency, here at FWS.  A waiver may be provided if FWS determines that (1) applying these requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.
Massachusetts is one of several Northeast states that has a climate change action plan which calls for significant CO2 emission reductions by 2020.  Integral to that plan is a wider adoption of non-emitting renewable sources of electricity.  The Massachusetts' Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires an increasing amount of the electricity sold in the Commonwealth to come from renewable electricity.  RPS is also one of the major policy tools put in place to meet the CO2 reduction goals under the climate change plan.  This project, while small, would contribute towards achieving those goals. The proposed combined heat and power generator is expected to contribute towards the goal of utilizing non-emitting renewable sources of electricity.

<p>Draft Objective:</p>
<p>The transfusion medicine field is in critical need of novel proof-of-concept ideas for pathogen reduction in order to facilitate the manufacturing of safer products to the end users. There is need for novel PR technologies, which are different from the current ones that confer a reduced toxicity and/or contamination risk. Recently High Intensity Narrow Spectrum (HINS)-light has been demonstrated to reduce or eliminate bacterial burden in the environment. Since this light is in the visible spectrum, it is anticipated that AEs associated with UV-spectrum of light-based photo-inactivation methods for blood and blood components can be avoided.</p>
<p><br />Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>The contractor may be required to demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>1. Explore a range of light intensities within the 400-500 nm wavebands and power intensities ranging from 1 mW/ cm2 up to 100mW/cm2 over different exposure periods.</p>
<p>2. Study a range of problematic bacterial species</p>
<p>3. Distinguish between bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects and how these parameters are influenced by HINS-light irradiation dose.</p>
<p>4. Initial scoping work shall involve materials and suspension transmission tests as well as bacterial inactivation studies using cuvette or well exposure studies before extending the work to whole bag inactivation tests. When testing at this level, unidirectional illumination shall be compared with bidirectional (above and below) under both static and shaken conditions.</p>
<p>5. The program shall include the development of appropriate HINS-light treatment equipment to permit the illumination of blood product bags over the range of conditions referred to above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part A. Capability and Technical Experience - Interested parties should submit capability statement describing relevant experience to the above requirement.</p>
<p>Part B. Size of Business - Provide your business size and submit copies of any documentation such as letters of certifications to indicate the firm status.</p>
<p>Part C. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) - If any, provide disclosure of business activates of your company, your affiliates, your team members and affiliates of your team member which create either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Part D. Cost Estimate - In accordance with FAR PART 10, provide a cost estimate for the prospective services to be conducted under the potential requirement.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, ignoring measurement error in covariates (a fairly common issue) may lead to misleading inferences on average treatment or exposure effects evaluation in non-randomized studies. Although an analysis based on a carefully conducted, randomized and controlled clinical trial is still the gold standard in obtaining valid causal effects of medical products, such designs can be either impractical or too burdensome to conduct in pre-market and post-market studies. For example, for medical devices, it is not uncommon to have a non-randomized design for the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study in the premarket phase; and very frequently a prospective, controlled cohort design is used for the Post-approval Study (PAS) of medical devices at the post-market phase. Average causal effect (ACE) estimation methods for these non-randomized studies have typically relied on standard propensity scoring techniques under the traditional causal framework, which assumes all covariates are measured accurately and no unobserved factors influence the treatment and outcome (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983,1984; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). However, covariates are often measured with unobservable error, which violates the critical assumption underlying the current causal framework. Since ignoring the error often leads to significant biased results, extending the standard causal inference framework allowing covariate measurement error and developing appropriate estimation methods are of critical importance for a valid assessment of the safety and efficacy of medical products (including devices, drugs, and biologics) in both the pre-market and post-market phases.</p>
<p>From an application point of view, the breast pump is a medical device regulated by CDRH and broadly used in US. A study has shown that 85% of mothers who breastfed infants that were 1.5-4.5 months old used a breast pump. However, little is known about how mothers' experiences with breast pumps, including both benefits and adverse events, impact their breast feeding practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants receive breast milk throughout the first year of their life. Therefore, it is important to know how the mother's breast feeding practice associated with the use of a breast pump and how the breast pump usage influences the infant's health. However, some important confounders, e.g. household social economic status and mother's post-natal health status, are either unobservable or liable to measurement error. The presence of measurement error in covariates violates the critical assumption underlying the current causal framework, which need new causal methods to address these two important questions. In this project, we plan to use IFPS II data (Infant Feeding Practices Study II) (Fein, 2008), a major longitudinal study conducted by FDA in collaboration with CDC, NIH, DHHS/OWH, and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The data have been analyzed for presentation at the annual meetings of the American Public Health Association in November 2007 and were published in a journal supplement in 2008.</p>
<p><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this requisition is to procure appropriate source to: (1) develop a causal inference framework to allow covariate measurement error; (2) develop a new causal inference model for average treatment effect estimation accounting for the measurement error structure under non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies; and (3) apply this new causal model on the evaluation of the health impact of breast pump usage using IFPS II data.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br />&bull; develop a new statistical methodology to: <br />o create a causal inference framework to allow for covariate measurement error. <br />o develop an average treatment effect (ATE) estimation model under the new causal framework that accounts for covariate measurement error, based on existing propensity score methodology.<br />o conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new method over the currently used propensity score-based causal inference method.<br />&bull; participate in developing and writing manuscripts describing the extended causal framework and the proposed new estimation methods. <br />&bull; conduct the data analysis, using IFPS II data, to evaluate the health impact of breast pump usage on mother's breast feeding behavior and infants' health status using the newly developed causal inference model and conventional propensity score-based causal inference method.<br />&bull; participate in writing manuscripts describing the impact of breast pump use on Mother and infant health. <br />&bull; submit the final report/documentation of the developed new Causal Inference Methodology.</p>
<p>Timeline with Major Milestones and Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit the following: (all submissions shall be electronic)</p>
<p>1) Statistical plan of developing a new causal inference methodology to allow covariate measurement error, and the documentation for the development of estimation methods.<br />2) Manuscript for the development of average treatment effect (ATE) model under the proposed causal framework accounting for covariate measurement error. <br />3) Data analysis results for the evaluation of the impact of breast pump usage on mother and infant health using IFPS II data. <br />4) The SAS or statistical programs used to analyze the data, and an interpretation of the results. <br />5) Final report and documentation of new Causal Inference Methodology and its application on the study of Breast Pump Use.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake procurement or other action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Governmentwill be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing the information requested in thisRFI.Through this RFI, NASA seeks to identify potential Sponsoring Organizations who may beinterested in partnering with Allied Organizations to support prize competitions to beconducted under Centennial Challenges program within the Innovative Partnership ProgramsOffice (http://www.nasa.gov/challenges	       ) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUNDCentennial Challenges is a program of incentive prizes to generate novel solutions toproblems of interest to NASA and the nation.  The mission of the program is to [1] driveprogress in aerospace technology of value to NASAs missions, [2] encourage theparticipation of independent teams, individual inventors, student groups and privatecompanies of all sizes in aerospace research and development; and [3] find the mostinnovative solutions to technical challenges through competition and cooperation.Since 2005, nineteen Centennial Challenges competitions have been held in six technicalareas.	A total of $4.5 million has been awarded in prizes to thirteen different teams. Competitions may be conducted in a first-to-demonstrate format or in a head-to-headcontest format.  The competition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format,typically involve public spectators, televised or webcasted coverage and arehigh-visibility opportunities for public outreach and education.  Additional informationcan be found at www.nasa.gov/challenges.ROLE OF ALLIED ORGANIZATIONSAllied Organizations are those NASA partners that conduct the Centennial Challengescompetitions. NASA provides the prize purse for the competitions, but no funding for theconduct of the competition itself.  Allied Organizations may provide additional fundingfrom other sources subject to NASAs approval.	Allied Organizations are selected througha competitive process and agreements are negotiated directly between the AlliedOrganization and NASA.	Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges for whichthey have responsibility. Because no NASA funds are provided to fund the conduct of the Challenges, AlliedOrganizations must administer the Challenges with their own funding or they must raisethe funding needed to administer the Challenges through partnerships with SponsoringOrganizations or through other means.	Allied Organizations are also permitted tosupplement the prize purse with funding from outside organizations, such as a SponsoringOrganization.ROLE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONSBecause the success of Challenges hinges on the ability of NASAs Allied Organizations tosuccessfully administer and conduct the prize competitions, NASA wishes, through thisRFI, to identify interested Sponsoring Organizations that seek the opportunity to partnerwith an Allied Organization to support one or more Challenges.	NASA expects thatindividual Challenges will demonstrate technologies or operational capabilities, andproduce high profile competition events that may enhance the visibility and reputation ofthe Sponsoring Organization. Sponsoring Organizations may contribute cash towards the prize purse or administrativeexpenses associated with the Challenges, and/or may provide in-kind support for one ormore Challenges. Sponsoring Organizations are expected enter into agreements directlywith the Allied Organization administering the sponsored Challenge.  NASA does notanticipate entering into agreements directly with any Sponsoring Organization.In return for its contribution, the Sponsoring Organization would be associated with aspecific Challenge and may be entitled to negotiate naming rights or other public-facingacknowledgement.  Depending on the agreement a Sponsoring Organization may negotiate withan Allied Organization, a Sponsoring Organization may provide input to the structure andrules of the Challenges to which it contributes. A Sponsoring Organization cannot competein the Challenge to which it contributes. Sponsoring Organizations may include but are not limited to: for-profit companies andcorporations, universities and other non-profit or educational organizations, andprofessional or public organizations, as well as individuals.Except as specified below, Challenges for which potential Sponsoring Organizations aresought are still in the formulation stage, and no final decision has been made on whetheror not to initiate the Challenges described below. Decisions to issue specific Challengesand their rules will be determined at later dates. SUBMISSION DETAILSResponses to this RFI should be no more than two (2) pages in length and: 	Provide all the pertinent identifying and contact information about the potentialSponsoring Organization, and the principal individuals of the Organization; 	Identify the Challenge(s) in which your organization may wish to partner with aNASA Allied Organization (see lists below). Organizations may indicate an interest insponsoring challenges in any or all topic areas. The following individual contact information should be included on any submission inresponse to this RFI: - Organization and Individual Point-of-Contact Name - Complete Mailing Address -Telephone Number(s) - Email Address Responses to this RFI should be sent to the Centennial Challenges Program at NASAHeadquarters by electronic message to: hq-prize-idea@mail.nasa.gov with the subject lineSponsorship RFI.DURATIONTo provide future opportunities to expand the number of Sponsoring Organizations, thisRFI will remain open continuously.  However, formulation of new challenges is currentlyunderway and immediate responses are encouraged. USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED UNDER THIS RFIInformation provided by interested, potential Sponsoring Organizations under this RFIwill be shared with current NASA Allied Organizations and other non-profit organizationsthat have expressed their interest or intent to partner with NASA as an AlliedOrganization for the Centennial Challenges program.  The information may also be sharedwithin NASA and with contractor personnel associated with the Centennial ChallengesProgram.  Information provided by potential Sponsoring Organizations under this RFI willnot be published or posted on any public website without prior authorization by thesubmitting entity.  Information provided under this RFI will be updated at least annuallyand organizations may add or remove their indication of interest at any time bycontacting the Point of Contact, below.   Organizations responding to this RFI may be contacted by the current or potential AlliedOrganizations to solicit commitment for sponsorship.  Potential Sponsoring Organizationshave no obligation to respond but may choose to enter into a sponsorship arrangement withone or more current or potential Allied Organizations. The ability of a potential AlliedOrganization to reach agreement with a Sponsoring Organization may improve its proposalto NASA to administer a Challenge but is no guarantee of selection as a NASA partner. Potential Sponsoring Organizations are responsible for conducting appropriate diligenceprior to entering into any arrangement with an Allied Organization.  Selection of anAllied Organization to administer a competition by NASA does not constitute anendorsement by NASA.There are three on-going Centennial Challenges:	Power Beaming Challenge for wireless power transmission, managed for NASA by theSpaceward Foundation of Mountain View, CA.  	Strong Tether Challenge for advanced materials, also managed for NASA by theSpaceward Foundation of Mountain View, CA.  	Green Flight Challenge for super-efficient, quiet and safe aircraft, managed forNASA by the Comparative Flight Efficiency Foundation of Santa Rosa, CA.New challenges will be announced in 2010 and additional new challenges are expected inthe years to follow.  The topics may include, but are not limited to, the followingtechnical areas:	Energy Generation and Storage	Access to Space, Rocketry and Space Transportation	Robotics and Automation	Aeronautics 	Earth and Space Science	Space Exploration	Life Sciences	Life Support, Habitation and Space Suits	Cryogenic Fluid Handling and Storage	Space Resources and Construction	Instruments and Sensors	Communications For more information see: www.nasa.gov/challenges or contact Andrew Petro, NASAHeadquarters, Phone (202) 358-0310, Email: andrew.j.petro@nasa.gov.

<DESC>TITLE: SAMPLING DESIGN ANALYSIS FOR OPTIMAL MONITERING OF THE PACIFIC ISLAND REGION BOTTOMFISH STOCKS AND ADVANCEMENT OF LENGTH-BASED STOCK ASSESMENT MODELS.
<p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns capable of furnishing the Fish Biology and Stock Assessment Division the resources to complete the study per the following statement of work requirements:</p>
<p>A. Overview</p>
<p>The Contractor will participant in collaborative research projects to (1) develop and implement optimal bottomfish fishery independent surveys in the Pacific Islands Region (PIR), (2) implement gear calibration studies to assess the efficacy of bottomfish survey gears and recommend preferred sampling strategies, and (3) advance length-based stock assessment models for use in assessing the status of bottomfish stocks in the PIR.</p>
<p>B. Statement of Work</p>
<p>A series of stock assessment workshops were convened in 2004 to assess current bottomfish and coral reef fish assessment methodologies in the PIR and develop a plan to improve data collection and assessment methodologies to a point where reliable resource assessments could be obtained (WPRFMC 2004a, 2004b). At the workshops, (1) current sources and state of available data and monitoring programs were reviewed, (2) weaknesses in current assessment methods were delineated, (3) alternative modeling and assessment methodologies were reviewed and identified, and (4) proposed courses of action to advance stock assessment methods and associated data collection were outlined. While there was consistency among many of the recommendations stemming from the workshops, the reevaluation of life history parameters and evaluation of spatial connectivity of isolated populations, as well as implementation of a fishery independent insular survey to estimate bottomfish abundance indices and development of alternative assessment models, were identified as high priorities. More recently, an Ecosystem Science and Management Planning Workshop was held in April 2005 and re-emphasized the need for a fishery independent survey to provide population level abundance indices for bottomfish and development of length-base stock assessment models. Current bottomfish stock assessments rely solely on fishery dependent generated abundance indices that are generally biased.</p>
<p>This is a one year (August 15, 2010 - August 14, 2011) collaborative project with NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) with potential for two additional option years. The NMFS, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) seeks to contract a contractor to (1) assemble available habitat data and bottomfish geo-referenced catch data into a user-friendly relational database, (2) examine the sources of bias caused by aggregating habitat and catch data at different spatial scales, (3) develop optimal bottomfish fishery independent survey designs, and (4) implement gear calibration studies for commonly used bottomfish survey gears and recommend preferred gear(s) and sampling strategy. In addition, the contractor will also utilize recently assembled bottomfish catch-at-length data to advance current length-based stock assessment models.</p>
<p>C. Deliverables</p>
<p>Most of the work will be completed off site. An initial meeting with collaborators to discuss data availability and assimilation, as well as analytical approaches, will be required and is scheduled for September 2010. Monthly progress will be discussed with the Agency Contact and contractor via conference calls. Quarterly progress reports will be submitted to the Agency Contact during the contract period and should describe progress to date on the four research elements outlined in section B (Statement of Work), as well as any unanticipated problems and their solution(s). A final report will be submitted to the Agency Contact within 35 days of the conclusion of the contract period. The report should include all analyses examining sources of bias at different spatial scales, a description of the optimal survey design, results from the gear calibration studies, a description of the preferred gear(s) and sampling strategy, and results from the length-based stock assessment research, as well as associated computer code and documentation to run the assessment models. In addition, the assembled relational database and accompanying documentation will be submitted to the Agency Contact within 35 days of the conclusion of the contract period.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541712 with a size standard of 500 people. All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement by July 9, 2010.</p>
<p>Interested firms shall provide in writing, a brief narrative and documentation to support the contractor's capability and experience to meet the requirements herein and include the contractor's name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS Number, CCR Cage Number, business type and size, i.e., small, large, non-profit, educational, etc. Any response that does not include this information will not be considered.

The Afloat Training Group Pacific (ATGPAC) developed a knowledge and dataenterprise solution called Training and Operational Readiness InformationSystem (TORIS). TORIS enables Commander, Naval Surface Force's (CNSF) ShipTraining (SHIPTRAIN) and Surface Warfare Enterprise (SWE) programs tocollect, store and display readiness and performance data to providecost-wise readiness. It was approved by the Department of the Navy Application and DatabaseManagement System (DADMS) in the fall of 2005 as an authoritative database.
As a suite of software applications, TORIS provides data collection, datadisplay and data sharing for all surface force ships and all Afloat TrainingGroups (both Pacific and Atlantic areas of responsibility). Included in theTORIS suite are the following associated applications:
a. Training Figure of Merit (TFOM). TFOM provides a lens into the TORIS database to provide units/ISICs a graphic representation of readiness across allwarfare areas.b. Ships In Training (SIT). An internal tracking tool to track ship'scertification status as they proceed through the unit level training cycle.c. Supply Management Certification (TORIS-Supply). Used to assess compliancewith CNSFINST 5040.1 series and track certification.d. 3M Certification (TORIS-3M). Used to assess compliance with CNSFINST4790.1 series Maintenance and Material Management certification.e. Scheduling and assignment of personnel - Master Scheduling Program(TORIS-MSP). Used to account for ATG manpower level of effort required todeliver training to surface ships.f. A human resource management (ATG Enterprise Personnel Program, AEPP).Integrates ATG personnel functions into TORIS-MSP to support efficientscheduling of personnel.g. TORIS-Afloat. Installed aboard every CNSF ship, is used by ship's forcein their daily routine to train to requirements and collect data generatedduring training exercises.  Installed on NIAPS servers or stand-alone systems.  Leverages the NIAPSreplication process for data transmission back to shore.
Additionally, TORIS feeds surface ship training readiness data to theDefense Readiness Reporting System-Navy (DRRS-N), which is the Navy'sMission Essential Tasks (METs)/capabilities-based readiness reportingsystem. 
There is a substantial requirement for contractor support to improvereliability and maintainability of TORIS to include installation of softwareon ships, troubleshooting software installed on ships, functional (business)analysis, software engineering and integration, configurationmanagement/quality control, database management/system administration, usertraining, fleet hardware procurement and distribution, help desk managementand documentation. Additionally, there is a significant amount of effort put into metricdevelopment and data analysis in direct support of the Surface WarfareEnterprise (SWE).

Due to the nature of testing required by the end user, to ensure the safety of ECBC personnel, and the complete compatibility with existing Swagelok fittings, it is imperative that tube fittings are not interchanged with components produced by different manufactures.  Baltimore Valve & Fitting Co. is an authorized Maryland distributor for Swagelok fittings. The final delivery date will be 08 August 2010. Partial shipments will be accepted.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423720 and size standard of 100 employees.<BR><BR>This acquisition will be made under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  <BR><BR>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<BR><BR>Interested parties with questions or comments regarding this notice or the planned procurement should be emailed to keyonna.garrett@us.army.mil by close of business on 21 June 2010. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.   <BR>

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.5 to ENDEVCO Corporation, 30700 Rancho Viejo Road, San  Juan Capistrano 92675-1788.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) -- only one responsible source and nother supplies or services will satisfy agency reqruiements.  Endevco is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the MatLab Software.  The Govermnet intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 DST on 18 Jun 2010.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  For Technical inquiries, please contact James Davis, james.davis@usace.army.mil.  Contracting Office POC: ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>1.  The Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL) is conducting field experiments in support of the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization Hard Impact Program at Eglin AFB.  During the course of these experiments it will be required to record a range of acceleration data.  In order to obtain this data, it is necessary to procure 10 2KG accelerometers (model # 7270A-2000) and 20 1KG accelerometers (model # 2262A-1000) from Endevco.<BR><BR>2.  The Sensors, Measurement, and Instrumentation (SM&I) Branch, Information Technology Laboratory has been tasked by GSL to provide acceleration measurement support to this ongoing research program.  Historically, SM&I Branch has used high-G accelerometers from a variety of companies to support GSLs research programs.  One company that has provided consistent and reliable accelerometers is Endevco.  Due to the reliability and accuracy of the Endevco accelerometers, the need to rerun expensive field tests has been reduced.  As the result of using accelerometers from Endevco for over 25 years, all current instrumentation, software, and mounting hardware are configured to support these sensors.<BR><BR>3.  There is a need to purchase additional accelerometers from Endevco to support an upcoming field test.  To maintain consistency with current test setup and to ensure reliability, it is recommended that these accelerometers be purchased from Endevco. <BR><BR>

<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). <br />USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Columbia, Missouri<br />2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).<br />a. Item is assay development that includes reagent sourcing, testing and validation for detection porcine IL-18, IFN-alpha, IL-13, and MCP-1 for inclusion in a multiplex sandwich-based ELISA assay specific for porcine targets. There are 4 states to the assay development for each target (IL-18, IFN-alpha, IL-13, and MCP-1) and assay development will only proceed through each step with specific validation. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).<br />Item is assay development that included reagent sourcing, testing and validation for detection porcine IL-18, IFN-alpha, IL-13, and MCP-1 for inclusion in a multiplex sandwich-based ELISA assay specific for porcine targets. There are 4 states to the assay development for each target (IL-18, IFN-alpha, IL-13, and MCP-1) and assay development will only proceed through each step with specific validation. <br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)). <br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) <br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, <br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." <br />(2) The named vendor is the only vendor that provides the multiplex sandwich-base ELISA assay specific for detecting porcine cytokines. The end-user's lab has the Aushon Biosystems SearchLight Plus Imager and Software specific for using the porcine specific assay plates. Aushon Biosystems is the only vendor that provides the assay plates for the SearchLight System. Aushon Biosystems has currently validated and commercially sell a kit for evaluating 9 porcine cytokines. However, the kit does not include targets that are important to the end-user's work and they can provide assay development for inclusion of those targets in the assay. The end-user requires Aushon Biosystems complete the assay development because they are the only vendor that uses this specific platform and can validate the additional porcine targets for inclusion into the assay. <br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required assay development. <br />b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.<br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).<br />After a thorough web search, no other suppliers were located that could supply this consumable. <br />8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).<br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the consumable is proprietary and only available from the vendor identified.<br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the proprietary nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other vendors can meet the research requirements. So far none have been able to. <br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

Background<br /><br />This is a one time order for peptides. We received an internal one year 2010 FDA grant to study the human response to the H1N1 influenza. These peptides will be used in assays to evaluate the human T-cell response to flu.<br /><br />C. Scope<br /><br />We wish to study the T-cell response of humans to the H1N1 influenza. This panel of 635 peptides will span 10 proteins made by the influenza virus. By stimulating human T-cells with these overlapping peptides, we should be able to see which proteins/peptides stimulate the largest and most common response to H1N1 flu. This will help in designing broadly protective vaccines. The scope of this work will be to supply the peptide reagents required for experiments. No other work will be required.</p>

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) in support of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) intends to solicit proposals under Solicitation Number RECOVERY&nbsp;- ST10-1078 for an initiative called "Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) in Support of the Clinical Assay Development Network (CADN) to Facilitate Development and Validation of Clinical Assays".<br /><br /><strong>ALL OFFERS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 2 PM (EDT) ON JULY 23, 2010,&nbsp;AND ALL QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATIONS MUST BE EMAILED TO THE POINT OF CONTACT NO LATER THAN 12 PM (EDT) ON JUNE 25, 2010.&nbsp; NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.<br /></strong><br />The Clinical Assay Development Network (CADN) is a new program being initiated by the NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) to facilitate development and validation of clinical assays. Comprehensive characterization of individual tumors promises to change the practice of medicine. This effort is being spurred by advances in our understanding of the biology of cancer and in the tremendously enabling technologies derived from the Human Genome Project. The timely translation of molecular findings to effective clinical tools will depend on the ability to rapidly evaluate the clinical relevance of molecular alterations observed in tumor specimens and to develop and technically validate assays to detect these alterations that can be used in the clinical setting.
<p>Significant amounts of data will be generated by the Patient Characterization Center, as well as in the cancer research community, that will be evaluated to determine which alterations found in human tumors are associated with clinical parameters of interest such as subclass of disease, risk of progression or likelihood of response to therapy. These data are expected to lead to development of new assays with the potential to guide clinical decision-making. The assays will be evaluated in both retrospective and prospective settings.<br /><br />Assays that will be used for clinical decision-making must meet criteria of performance such as those set out in guidance documents of the FDA and/or those recently published by the Strategy Group of the Program for the Assessment of Clinical Cancer Tests (PACCT) for integral assays in clinical trials http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/scientificPrograms/pacct/PACCT_Assay_Standards_Document.pdf . Participants in the CADN will partner with various programs in DCTD and other components of the NCI and their extramural partners to optimize and technically validate assays that are proposed for inclusion as integral components of phase III and large phase II clinical trials; to optimize and technically validate assays proposed as integrated assays in trials; and potentially to collaborate with investigators with research grade assays to assist in early stage clinical assay development. A Clinical Assay Development Center (CADC) is being established at NCI. Together the CADC and the CADN will create a process to efficiently develop diagnostic tools that will address clinical needs, including (but not limited to) markers of prognosis, patient selection for co-development with targeted agents and prediction of response. Initially, the emphasis will be on evaluating the performance characteristics of assays proposed for use in clinical trials. The CADC and CADN will provide the resources to carry out the necessary assay, optimization and technical validation. Project teams including pathologists, statisticians and experts in assay development will be formed to identify services required, to design the assay specific studies.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of planned clinical assay development activities, SAIC-F is seeking the services of clinical laboratories with demonstrated expertise, infrastructure and resources necessary to validate clinical assays. This shall include experience in assay development, optimization, technical validation, demonstration of assay clinical performance, and preparation of detailed datasets and SOP's. . The contracted laboratories will have to be CLIA-certified. The laboratories shall have to have expertise in one or more of the following technologies: immunohistochemistry, ELISA, in situ hybridization, quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative PCR, and DNA sequencing. Additional technologies may be required in the future and they would be included in subsequent solicitations.</p>
<p>The objective of this statement of work (SOW) is to describe the requirements for the CADN which will be established through the BOA under which future task orders will be issued to acquire services targeted for specific CADN supported projects.</p>
<p>Task orders issued under this BOA shall request the subcontractor to provide specific services to meet the needs of separate studies requested and/or directed by specific customers to be conducted by the CADN over the life of the task order.</p>
<p>SAIC-F will engage with Offerors that have demonstrated clinical laboratory expertise, infrastructure and resources necessary to validate clinical assays including experience in assay development, optimization, technical validation, demonstration of assay clinical performance, and preparation of detailed datasets and SOP's. Specifically, Offerors laboratories must be CLIA certified and the laboratories must have expertise in one or more of the following technologies:</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry<br />ELISA<br />In situ hybridization<br />Quantitative ReverseTranscriptasePolymeraseChain Reaction (RT-PCR)<br />Quantitative PCR <br />DNA sequencing</p>
<p>Additional technologies may be required in the future and would be requested in subsequent task order solicitations.</p>

The technical services provided shall include - for each refactored data service - the identification and specification of Functional, Semantic, and Conformance profiles for the refactored services which provide CBIIT with sSOA-compliant services that CBIIT can leverage and interoperate within the context of multiple additional CBIIT Translational Medicine Continuum initiatives. In order to support legacy access to the existing data models, refactored service Functional Profiles will include a Profile which enables a service client to access - and then query within the client application - the entire data model in a manner similar to current data discovery and query practice, thereby minimizing the migration path from legacy to refactored application architecture. This Functional Profile is, in particular, aimed at supporting legacy applications which view data discovery and query in the context of the entire legacy data model as currently exposed on the Grid.
<p>Specifically, the Subcontractor shall deliver semantically robust specifications that are compliant with CBIIT's ECCF IG that provide well-defined behaviors and loose couplings to information; and reusable components that can be rapidly adapted to caBIG&reg; clients in many contexts. Wherever possible, existing API's and data models will be used as a basis for compilation and composition to create first cut, business level services. In situations where this is not possible, the Subcontractor must first validate that decision with the SAIC-F COTR in conjunction with CBIIT technical leadership and then provide suitable documentation for any alternative strategy/implementation path developed.</p>

<DESC>A single contract awarded as a result of this acquisition will provide support to a coordinating center for the ALLHAT trial to enable and foster scientific contribution based on extensive ALLHAT data and other resources and to expand collaborations with relevant clinical and scientific communities outside of ALLHAT. 

Hypertension affects one third of the U.S. adult population and is associated with substantially increased risks of heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal failure and coronary heart disease.  Because of high prevalence and associated morbidity and disability, it contributes significantly to health care costs.  

ALLHAT was funded in 1993.  It was a randomized, double-blinded, practice-based trial designed to determine whether the incidence of major coronary heart disease (CHD) events (primary endpoint) is reduced in high-risk patients with hypertension treated with a calcium channel blocker (CCB; amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril), or an alpha-blocker (doxazosin), each compared with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) as first-step therapy.  The Lipid-Lowering Trial, conducted in a subgroup of the ALLHAT participants (N=10,355), was designed to compare open-label pravastatin with usual care for prevention of total mortality (primary endpoint).  Between 1994 and 1998, 42,418 participants were recruited from 623 clinics, mostly primary care, across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  After an average of 4.9 years of follow-up (3.2 for the doxazosin arm, which was terminated early), the investigators reported that the primary endpoint, a composite of fatal CHD and non-fatal myocardial infarction, did not differ across the randomized treatment comparisons  despite better metabolic profiles in the participants randomized to receive the newer antihypertensive agents.  In addition, the diuretic-based therapy was superior to the alpha-blocker, ACE inhibitor and CCB-based therapies in preventing one or more major forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke and heart failure.  

The ALLHAT participants have been followed since the end of the trial in 2002 through national administrative data bases, including the National Death Index (NDI), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), United States Renal Data System (USRDS), and Social Security Administration (SSA).  Outcomes data through 2006 are currently being analyzed.  During the combined active and passive average follow-up of nearly 9 years, about a third of participants died.  

The purpose of this renewal is to optimize scientific advancement from the study by leveraging NHLBI's investment in the existing resources.  The renewal will complement the ALLHAT public access data base.  While it is important to have databases publicly available, and many research objectives (including training of early stage investigators) can be met this way, complex concepts and analyses (especially those involving merging data sources) will be best achieved (or in some cases may only be accomplished) through collaboration with an experienced investigative team who understands the intricacies of the study and nuances of the original data set.

Given the modest amount of funding, the extension is envisioned as complementary to the existing and future investigator-initiated sources of funding.  Potential research areas that can be engaged during the proposed extension under the leadership of the ALLHAT Steering Committee and, where appropriate, in collaboration with the GenHAT Steering Committee are described below.  Funding for some of the components, primarily to obtain pilot data or synthesize available information to stimulate and enable investigator-initiated grant writing, would be provided by the contract funds while major research questions would be addressed through other funding mechanisms.

Selected Research Examples

In this next phase, ALLHAT investigators in collaboration with outside researchers and practitioners will further evaluate predictors of long-term clinical outcomes, overall and by randomized treatment assignment, in complex demographic and clinical phenotypes represented in the ALLHAT study population.  These analyses could include multimorbid conditions in 2,772 participants with new-onset heart failure during the main trial; 22,551 with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m2) at baseline; 15,740 with Type II diabetes at baseline and 1,458 with incident diabetes during 4-8 years of active follow-up.  Additional hospitalized and fatal events have been collected from the administrative databases. 

The extension is also expected to take to a new level ALLHATs contribution to pharmacogenetics of hypertension as data emerging from the genetic ancillary study (GenHAT) show potential for contribution to genetically-guided personalized medicine.  Recently completed pilot analysis of a limited frozen sera resource offers a possibility of assessing relevant biomarkers such as NTproBNP and adiponectin in a context of randomized treatment assignments.

The following examples of research areas that may be engaged under this extension illustrate the rich potential of continued support for the ALLHAT infrastructure.

 	Long-term follow-up and hypertension decision/economic model 
 
ALLHATs large and diverse population with long-term follow-up offers a unique opportunity to inform development of a decision model for patients with hypertension. There is an established model for CHD but not for hypertension.  Extension of the passive follow-up, which by the end of 2011 will result in an average overall follow-up of about 14 years, is a cost-effective way to learn about long-term outcomes in high CVD risk elderly patients with hypertension.  The resulting database will also provide opportunities for health services research.  
 
                    Evaluation of atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline and during follow-up
 
ALLHAT baseline and follow-up (bi-annual) ECGs have been centrally coded (University of Minnesota) for AF. In addition, the ALLHAT Heart Failure Validation Study collected information on AF occurring in the context of nearly 3,000 hospitalizations with heart failure.  To date, only one manuscript on this topic has been written, which describes factors associated with prevalent AF at baseline (N=423) and baseline characteristics associated with development of new-onset AF (N=641) during the randomized phase of the trial.  The incidence of AF was analyzed by randomized treatment assignment, and in-trial clinical outcomes in those with prevalent and new-onset AF were reported for the entire cohort.  Future research may focus on genetic and other markers of racial and gender differences in AF prevalence, incidence and response to antihypertensive treatment.  In addition, because ALLHAT excluded individuals with symptomatic heart failure or known LVEF<35% at baseline, an opportunity exists to evaluate the occurrence and prognosis of AF in a context of randomized antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in participants without heart failure and in ~2,000 participants who developed new-onset heart failure during the active follow-up phase of the trial.  Additional information on hospitalized and outpatient AF diagnoses may be obtained from administrative databases.
 
	     Contribution to personalized medicine
 
The ALLHAT/GenHAT collaboration has the potential for bringing closer to reality a promise of personalized medicine with respect to pharmacotherapy of hypertension  through 1) the richness of phenotypes, 2) genetic information obtainable on almost all ALLHAT participants, which can be analyzed in a randomized setting to evaluate how genotype modifies treatment effects on major clinical outcomes, and 3) assessment of predictive role of baseline levels of several important biomarkers on long-term clinical outcomes, overall and by randomized treatment assignment.

C.	COST/PRICE EVALUATION: 
Offeror proposed price shall be evaluated on realism and reasonable for the Government to purchase the equipment. 

For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.
Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost/price for the equipment in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost/Price realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost/price realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.

D.	TRADEOFF-DECISION (SELECTION FOR AWARD):
Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose technical and price proposals, in conforming to this solicitation, provides an overall best value to the Government. The Governments objective is to obtain the highest technically accepted proposal at the most fair and reasonable proposed price. In selecting an offeror for award, offerors are instructed and advised that lowest price technically acceptable shall not automatically determine best overall value. Below is a table for information purposes to demonstrate the overall tradeoff process and an example that the Government may select higher technical acceptable proposal at a higher proposed price due to the overall value.

	TRADE-OFF TABLE
	Overall Technical Rating	Proposed Price
Vendor A	Unacceptable	$80
Vendor B	Acceptable	$210
Vendor C	Exceptionally Acceptable	$225
Vendor D	Acceptable	$220
 
  
In the example above, the Government could select Vendor C for award because overall best value is justified and supported that $225 is considered a fair and reasonable price for the purchase of the equipment. To select an Exceptional Offeror for $15 greater than the lowest-priced/technical acceptable is considered obtaining the highest quality of equipment for the proposed price. (Overall Exceptionally Acceptable would be a result of receiving 6 or more Exceptionally Acceptable ratings per criteria listed above).

The focus of this resource is its 830 plus topic pages which contains links to quality government information, particularly NLM and other NIH resources, as well as other high quality information contributors. MedlinePlus is not an index of all consumer health information on the Web; rather it a database that contains highly selective links representing the best information in terms of quality, literacy level, authority of authorship, uniqueness and appropriateness for MedlinePlus' users.

1.4 Preparation of Surfaces:
WARNING!  If you scrape, sand, or remove old paint, you may release lead dust.  LEAD IS TOXIC, EXPOSURE TO LEAD DUST CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS, SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN.  PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD ALSO AVOID EXPOSURE.  Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator to control lead exposure.  Clean up carefully with a HEPA vacuum and a wet mop.  Before your start, find out how to protect yourself and your family by contacting the National Lead Information Hotline at 1-800-424-LEAD or log on to www.epa.gov/lead.

NOTE: 	When applying 100% acrylic paints in neutral or deep colors you will find they may not be available in Sherwin-Williams Duration Acrylic Satin and a change to Sherwin-Williams Exterior Accents will be necessary.  This product is slightly higher in cost and should be reflected in your bid proposals.  If a pastel color is chosen, the contractor should apply a sample area to be sure of one coat coverage.  We will make every effort to make this determination when writing the specifications.
B.	Areas not to be painted:"	Areas Not Listed Above




C.	Pressure Cleaning:
1.	All exterior surfaces are to be pressure-cleaned using a minimum of 3000 Lb. P.S.I. to obtain a sound substrate and to remove all loose paint and surface contaminations such as, salt deposits, mildew, and algae.  Pressure cleaning not to precede application of sealer coat by more than three (3) weeks.  NOTE:  Special attention should be paid to insure that all loose material is removed exposing a sound substrate.  Where algae are present, the areas may appear to be clean after pressure cleaning and still be contaminated.  The manufacturer's representative will inspect and clear these areas along with the remaining areas before the sealer application begins.
2.	On any and all areas where mildew is present, remove mildew using bleach and water.  Follow manufacturer's precautions and handling instructions on bleach products.  Shrubbery which cannot be readily covered should be sprayed with water before bleach solution is applied and again afterward.
D.	Patching (Prior to application of finish coats and after sealer coats):
1.	All hairline cracks and shrinkage cracks of 1/16 of an inch or smaller shall be bridged using S/W ConSeal Smooth or Textured Elastomeric Patches A5 Series by applying the product generously over the center of the crack.  Then using a broad knife or brush, feather the material out on both sides of the crack and crowned on center to allow for any movement.	2.	Cracks of greater than 1/16 of an inch should be routed out to form a "V".  The joint should cleaned and then be primed using S/W Loxon Guide Coat 100% Acrylic Conditioner A24 Series.  Caulk the joint using NP1 One Component Polyurethane Sealant.  Then apply a coat of S/W ConSeal Smooth or Textured Elastomeric Patches A5 Series in a similar manner to the hairline cracks above.
3.	All loose, broken or spalled stucco is to be removed and the area repaired based on the amount of square footage agreed upon between the owner and contractor.  Conform patch to match existing surfaces as closely as possible.  All replaced stucco must cure a minimum of three (3) days and must be primed using S/W Loxon Guide Coat 100% Acrylic Conditioner A24 Series.
4.	All previous crack repairs that have re-opened are to be treated as noted in 1 and 2.  Note:  Remove all existing material applied on initial repair.  All repairs are to be textured in a way that will match the adjoining surfaces as closely as possible.
NOTE:	This specification does not address the repair of concrete or structural damage.  A structural engineer of the owner's choice should address these repairs.  Without the proper repair to these areas you may see some deterioration of our coating.
E.	Caulking (prior to application of finish coats and after sealer coats)
1.	All deteriorated sealants are to be removed and the joints are to be cleaned and wiped out with Xylene.  These joints along with the ones listed below are to be caulked using NP1 One Component Polyurethane Sealant.
"	Window and Door perimeters (metal to stucco joints only)."	Windowsill returns and sides."	Tops and sides of decorative bands."	Stucco control joints."	Building expansion joints."	All penetrations including electrical and plumbing fixtures."	All vertical changes in wall direction."	Between dissimilar materials such as wood to stucco, metal to stucco, etc."	Wood to wood butt joints.
NOTE:	Some sealants are not always compatible with all other architectural sealants.  Therefore, determination of the type of material to be caulked over is essential before proceeding with any caulking of areas.
All sealant joints are to be a minimum of  inch wide.  This will allow for at least  inch adhesion to both sides of the joint.
          Same sample areas of each phase of the work shall be done and checked for acceptance as the job standard for the remainder of that phase of the work.  This will also prevent a misunderstanding as to the interpretation of the specification stand expense. A designated NPS representative will serve on site as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.

NOTE:
"	Before the sealer application is started, the Sherwin-Williams representative will examine the surfaces in order to verify that a sound substrate has been achieved.
"	After inspecting the cleaning, the Sherwin-Williams representative will determine whether to use the acrylic or alkyd sealer on this project.
"	Areas that are not to receive sealer will have to be pre-approved by the owner and the Sherwin-Williams representative.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, MI intends to procure a 4 bay, triple high, Vehicle Stacker Parking Lift System capable of parking twelve test vehicles. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the above described procurement.
<p>As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles. Part of this implementation involves sharing the ground floor space for other test enclosures, which consumes the current vehicle parking area.</p>
<p>The US EPA NVFEL (National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory) in Ann Arbor, Michigan provides certification conformity tests for motor vehicles. As part of the test sequence process, vehicles are preconditioned and then parked in a temperature controlled soak area for 12-36 hours to stabilize before the emissions test is done. This soak area has 20 feet of clear height under 90" deep roof girders that are set on 10' centers. This space would enable the stacking of multiple levels of vehicles in order to optimize the storage/soak and test capacity of the limited soak floor area.</p>
<p>Standard vehicle lifts have been used in the automotive industry for this purpose. This document details the dimensions and specifications requirements for the triple lift structures that could be installed at NVFEL for this same purpose. Test vehicles are moved without starting or driving them by use of a RICO vehicle (crab) mover. The stackers system shall be designed to function and integrate with these vehicle movers in getting the vehicles on and off the stacker lift platforms. The contractor shall design, fabricate, deliver, install, and test the equipment to assure that it meets the functions specified and meets all the requirements herein.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Stacker System shall conform to the requirements specified in the procurement Scope of Work. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project - configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting compliance with any applicable building codes.<br />This procurement will be made using a trade-off analysis to determine the best value to the government. The applicable North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238290, "Vehicle Lift Installation." This procurement is being procured on a full and open competition basis. In addition to price, the Government's evaluation of proposals will address each offeror's project approach and experience and past performance. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price for purposes of source selection. The solicitation will be released through the internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Prospective offerors can download the Request for Proposals and related documents from this website currently. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

POSITION TITLE: Economic Growth Advisor<br />5. MARKET VALUE: GS- 15 ($99,628 to $129,517 per annum). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.<br /><br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years <br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Nepal, Kathmandu, with possible travel as stated in the position description.<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Nepal is a landlocked country situated between India and China. It has an estimated population of 28 million, with a rich diversity of ethnic and religious groups. Following a decade-long insurgency, Nepal has sustained a comprehensive peace agreement for more than three years and has taken major steps toward instituting democratic constitutional rule. The monarchy has been abolished, a representative Constituent Assembly has been elected, and a transitional government is in place. There is a broad national consensus on the need to address critical development challenges and on the need for political reform, although progress has been hampered by a lack of agreement about how to carry out reform.</p>
<p>Nepal is one of the poorest, least-developed countries in Asia. The workforce is largely unskilled; unemployment is high; and there is a high vulnerability to natural disasters - mostly floods and landslides, which annually disrupt the lives of tens of thousands. Agriculture accounts for 32% of GDP and 68% of the labor force, but Nepal is unable to meet domestic demand for food. Industry is limited and uncompetitive, due to location, high costs, low product quality, labor unrest and political instability. On the positive side, Nepal has major potential for increased growth through tourism and hydropower development, the former having great job-growth potential and the latter having great income-generating potential domestically and through a ready-made export market for its surplus electrical-power in India.</p>
<p>The United States has had a positive and productive relationship with Nepal for more than 55 years and has contributed more than $1 billion in assistance. This assistance has affected the lives of the Nepali people in measurable ways. For example, during the last 25 years, U.S. assistance has helped Nepal reduce the fertility rate from 6.3 to 3.1 children per woman. In just the last 10 to 15 years, USAID has also helped to increase contraceptive prevalence from 15% to 44.2%, and lower under-five mortality by 52%. In recent years, more than 275,000 rural farmers have increased their incomes by at least 50% and 735,000 Nepalese now benefit from access to rural roads as a result of U.S. assistance programs. United States Government (USG) engagement is significant to Nepal's transition to democracy and the implementation of critical development priorities.</p>
<p>The USG has the following Strategic Vision for Nepal for the end of the current strategy period (2013): Measurable progress in expanding and deepening democracy, strengthening public and private institutions, and supporting policies to promote economic growth and poverty reduction. U.S. assistance will target gaps in both host-country resources and capabilities and other donors' assistance programming, emphasizing those areas where it has a predominance of expertise and capability. In this way, U.S. assistance will achieve maximum impact relative to the amount of resources expended, avoid duplication of effort by either the host country or other donors, and be able to clearly demonstrate the results of its assistance.</p>
<p>It is within this context that the Economic Growth (EG) Advisor will oversee the USAID Mission's economic growth portfolio. USAID/Nepal's EG portfolio consists of a complex set of newly designed and ongoing activities, aimed at macroeconomic policy reform, fostering private sector led growth, increasing agricultural production, strengthening microfinance policy and institutions, providing vocational education to youth and disadvantaged groups, improving efficiencies in the energy sector, and improving natural resource management.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br />This is a best value, commercial item acquisition; award may be made to the offeror propsing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery, and past performance in the above order of precedence.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required. <br />(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision) <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 25 May 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 28 MAY 2010. E-mail quotes are acceptable and may be sent to Debora.J.Plymel@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200124 in subject line.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated.

<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>This requirement is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). An LPTA evaluation will be performed for each of the two CLINs. Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price.

Price Evaluation: CLIN 0001 unit price will be multiplied by CLIN 0001 quantity (10) to determine total CLIN 0001 price. 
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the Technical Assistance Group.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG Team. USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor who will provide OFDA with technical assistance in program assessment and planning, specifically related to disaster risk reduction. This will involve strategy development and implementation, monitoring of DRR activities, providing representation at international forums, and other related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Disaster Risk Reduction Advisor will be based in Washington, DC. The duties and responsibilities are:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the focal point within USAID/OFDA for Disaster Risk Reduction programs and activities;<br />&bull; Contribute to the development and communication of appropriate DRR strategies and policies for OFDA and the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency-response;<br />&bull; Coordinate with international donors, NGOs, UN agencies, and other regional, national, and local partners to promote the implementation of DRR activities in disaster-prone regions. <br />&bull; Work with USAID Missions and development partners to advocate for the integration of DRR into development activities, and identify ways to incorporate DRR into early recovery and transition activities.<br />&bull; Provide technical expertise to ensure that OFDA DRR activities are sound, sustainable, and appropriate within the OFDA mandate. This will involve the following activities: <br />o A systematic analysis of available DRR tools and programmatic guidance,<br />o Assistance to regional teams and technical leads in assessing gaps and needs,<br />o Review and analyze DRR efforts by other organizations,<br />o Assessment of priority countries for DRR interventions, <br />o Development of strategic and comprehensive approaches to DRR through a greater understanding of local methodologies such as the coping strategies of marginalized populations, <br />o Review of DRR-related project proposals and regional strategies. <br />o Coordinate with the Training Unit to incorporate DRR into various OFDA training modules, as appropriate, in order to build capacity within OFDA and among partner relief agencies.<br />o Work with the OFDA Evaluation and Reporting Coordinator to develop appropriate indicators for DRR activities.<br />&bull; Coordinate with TAG sector leads to develop technically sound DRR strategies in an effort to integrate DRR programming with programming goals within the overall sector;<br />&bull; Maintain up-to-date, expert-level knowledge of the technical area and of the organizations engaged in related program activities;<br />&bull; Serve as requested on field assessment missions, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs);<br />&bull; Serve as DCHA/OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

That model has a workspace interior of 20 inches x 22 inches x 20 inches which equals 5 cubic feet. Does the chamber you require have to be exactly that size inside? While we do build custom chambers of any size, in order to be price competitive we would need to quote a standard model and they are larger than 5 cubic feet. <BR><BR>Answer 1: This procurement is brand name or equal. The 5 cubic feet is a minimum requirement, so the internal volume can be larger. The key requirement is a Minimum inside Working Dimensions: 20 inches H x 22 inches W x 20 inches D and Maximum outside Dimensions: 80 inches H x 31 inches W x 44 inches D. It can be a larger inside volume, but not exceed the maximum outside dimensions. <BR>

The DSS long distance charge estimate for this location is $50 per month. Vendor may offer a fixed price line item that includes local and long distance service or Vendors may offer a fixed price for local service and a separate CLIN for long distance. However, the number used to calculate the evaluated price of each vendor will be the Government's Monthly Estimate for Long Distance Service.</p>
<p><br />The evaluated price will be the sum of the equipment, shipping, installation, training, base year and four one-year option periods of service charges (local and long distance) and base year and four one-year option periods of maintenance.Vendor may offer seperately priced local and long distance service or a combined flat rate local/long distance package.

If the Vendor quotes a flat rate local/long distance package (this is preferred) the evaluated price will be calculated based on the Vendor's quote.</p>

Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><strong>THE PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION #1 IS TO MODIFY THE DUE DATE FOR PROPOSALS.&nbsp; PROPOSALS ARE DUE JULY 6, 2010 BY 3:00 PM EASTERN TIME.<br /></strong><br /><br />The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, MI intends to procure a 4 bay, triple high, Vehicle Stacker Parking Lift System capable of parking twelve test vehicles. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the above described procurement.
<p>As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles. Part of this implementation involves sharing the ground floor space for other test enclosures, which consumes the current vehicle parking area.</p>
<p>The US EPA NVFEL (National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory) in Ann Arbor, Michigan provides certification conformity tests for motor vehicles. As part of the test sequence process, vehicles are preconditioned and then parked in a temperature controlled soak area for 12-36 hours to stabilize before the emissions test is done. This soak area has 20 feet of clear height under 90" deep roof girders that are set on 10' centers. This space would enable the stacking of multiple levels of vehicles in order to optimize the storage/soak and test capacity of the limited soak floor area.</p>
<p>Standard vehicle lifts have been used in the automotive industry for this purpose. This document details the dimensions and specifications requirements for the triple lift structures that could be installed at NVFEL for this same purpose. Test vehicles are moved without starting or driving them by use of a RICO vehicle (crab) mover. The stackers system shall be designed to function and integrate with these vehicle movers in getting the vehicles on and off the stacker lift platforms. The contractor shall design, fabricate, deliver, install, and test the equipment to assure that it meets the functions specified and meets all the requirements herein.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Stacker System shall conform to the requirements specified in the procurement Scope of Work. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project - configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting compliance with any applicable building codes.<br />This procurement will be made using a trade-off analysis to determine the best value to the government. The applicable North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238290, "Vehicle Lift Installation." This procurement is being procured on a full and open competition basis. In addition to price, the Government's evaluation of proposals will address each offeror's project approach and experience and past performance. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price for purposes of source selection. The solicitation will be released through the internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Prospective offerors can download the Request for Proposals and related documents from this website currently. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<CONTACT>Christopher L. Muntz, Email christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>This is a reposting of Sources Sought&nbsp;# SSS-06-10-PKY which was previously cancelled.<br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. <br /><br />The Air Force's (AF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC), Wright-Patterson AFB, is issuing a sources sought synopsis to determine if there are businesses qualified and capable of supplying and installing light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway lighting fixtures at AF bases. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 335129 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The CECC is seeking a Capability Package from all qualified contractors. Responses should include information identifying whether the interested firm is a small or large business. <br /><br />The ESG CECC was established as part of the AF's Installation Acquisition Transformation (IAT) with a goal to strategically source civil engineering commodities enterprise-wide. The CECC's taxiway lighting spiral will convert all existing AF airfield taxiway quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The CECC is determining the optimal sourcing strategy to handle the purchase of LED taxiway lighting fixtures as well as the subsequent installation on the airfield. The CECC intends to identify companies with the capability to install taxiway fixtures at bases within a specified region(s). See attachment for a breakdown of bases that are located within identified regions and the associated number of fixtures. It is anticipated that the contractor must handle projects at multiple bases, sometimes simultaneously, within the awarded region. Interested companies are asked to highlight which region/regions they intend to cover in their response.<br /><br />At a summary level, the anticipated scope for the LED taxiway lighting acquisition includes:<br /><br />&bull; Remove elevated and in-pavement taxiway edge light fixtures.<br />&bull; Furnish and install new elevated (L-861T) and in-pavement (L-852) light-emitting diode taxiway fixtures.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Fixtures must be Federal Aviation Administration approved, in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular 150/5345-46C.<br />&bull; Fixtures may be installed in the continental United States (CONUS) on over 40 AF bases in varying quantities per base.<br />&bull; The period of performance for the project at each base is estimated to be 90 days.<br /><br />The Government anticipates the contractor will provide all personnel, materials, equipment, and services necessary to perform the tasks outlined above. The contractor must be able to obtain the adequate security clearance to perform the work on-base.<br /><br />**Amendment 01 provides clarity on the information to be included in the response:**<br /><br />At a minimum, it is requested that the respondent provide:<br /><br />&bull; Their status as a small or large business<br />&bull; A statement that the respondent is capable of performing the scope of work as identified<br />&bull; Information regarding successfully completed similar projects on airfields<br />&bull; Ability to handle performance of this scope of work on more than one airfield-potentially simultaneously<br />&bull; Detail on which region(s) can be covered by your company<br /><br />Responses are due no later than 1 PM EST 25 June 2010. Your submittal should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages. If late information is received, it may be considered by the Government Evaluation Team, depending on agency time constraints. Responses should be submitted by email to the following:<br /><br />Mr. Chris Muntz<br />email: christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil<br /><br />IMPORTANT: This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future, or represent the amount of work anticipated. This does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this sources sought synopsis. All costs associated with responding to this sources sought synopsis will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this sources sought Synopsis does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the sources sought respondent to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

<DESC>CURRENTLY AN AMENDMENT IS BEING PREPARED FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  IT WILL PUBLISHED BETWEEN 06/11 AND 06/14/10.  BECAUSE OF THE TIME FOR PREPARATION AND POSTING, AND TO GIVE OFFERORS A FULL WEEK TO CONSIDER THE AMENDMENT, THE DUE DATE FOR OFFERS WILL BE EXTENDED BY 7 DAYS TO 06/25/10.  

The government anticipates awarding a 5-year indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quality contract for the services specified.  Offers shall be submitted for the difficulty levels listed below.

Introduction

The government is acquiring fuels management services by use of mechanical equipment to treat vegetation to reduce the risk of wildland fires, enhance ecosystems and improve wildlife habitat.

Background

The purpose of this contract is to secure mechanical treatment services to create and maintain fuelbreaks, and to be used for forest health activities on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Vegetation types and terrain differ from around the forest which may include reforestation areas, natural and managed stands of timber of all ages, size and species, and shrub fields. Vegetation to be treated will require cutting, chipping, shredding and mulching.  The treatment will reduce ladder fuels and rearrange natural vegetation to a state that will burn with reduced fire intensity during a wildfire event.  Firefighter safety will be improved as well as a reduced threat to the public and private property.   The work shall be done in a manner that does not damage vegetation not specified to be treated.

Scope of Contract

The services in this contract are designed to provide for wildfire hazard reduction, ecosystem enhancement and improve wildlife habitat.  Mastication treatments can take place at any point during the year as long as weather, ground conditions and fire conditions allow for.

Other fuels reduction activities not priced on the schedule of items are suject to negotiation.

The technical point of contract for information on the potential task orders is Steve Howell of the Carson Ranger District.  showell@fs.fed.us,   Desk: 775-884-8114  Cell: 775-721-2064.

<DESC>Amendment 2 Posted without links. Proceed to Amendment 3. <br /><br />PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY &amp; PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES <br />The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTDC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under contracts N01CM42200, N01CM42201, N01CM42202, N01CM42203, and N01CM42204. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. DTP is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications. The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.
<p>Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment-managed basis. Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement, multiyear" contracts resulting from this solicitation. Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually, per contract The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents and dogs including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, of the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in rodents, dogs and/or non-human primates treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm. For purposes of this RFP, a pharmaceutical, chemical or Biotechnology Company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that prior to awarding of funds for contracts involving the use or intended use of animals in research; an acceptable assurance statement must be on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR).</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Draft Study Report, Final Study Report, Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five years (4/1/2011 through 3/31/2016).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>This solicitation is scheduled for release on or about April 30, 2010. The RFP may be accessed through the NCI Office of acquisitions home page located at <br />http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/index.jsp.

<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm. For purposes of this RFP, a pharmaceutical, chemical or Biotechnology Company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that prior to awarding of funds for contracts involving the use or intended use of animals in research; an acceptable assurance statement must be on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR).</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Draft Study Report, Final Study Report, Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five years (4/1/2011 through 3/31/2016).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>

If not, would 30+ years be considered equivalent? 
ANSWER:  No. 2.  Twenty (20) years amounts to equivalent training and experience for a graduate degree in anthropology or archeology.  Statement "or equivalent training and experience" would apply.

The determination for this acquisition lies solely with the government. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, is conducting this market research to ascertain if there are HUBZones which have the capability to design and construct approximately 48,000 gal vehicle fueling facility to replace an existing vehicle fueling facility that will be demolished as part of this project. The facility will be comprised of separate entry and exit gates allowing for a continuous one directional flow of vehicles to covered three fueling islands with six fueling pumps (2 per island); and construct a approximately 300 sq. ft. control building with an office space for one person, a unisex single user handicapped restroom, an eyewash station and an arctic entry.

See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>Based on the 1/245ths mission and the addition of an Airfield Management Element (AME) as part of the Airfield Operations Battalion, the requirement exists for a series of complex collective training events and exercise activities aimed at ensuring the 1-245th demonstrates proficiency in all Mission Essential Tasks to ensure mission success.  Utilizing the FAR exception of unusual and compelling circumstances covers this situation of aviation airfield operations doctrine lacking a focused training program to cover these tasks because of its newly induction into doctrine.  The program is currently being created, but due to the critical timing and need of the 1-245th AOB to complete these tasks to be mission ready and capable in these tasks for mobilization; the Oklahoma Army National Guard is requesting this requirement to be conducted by Saber Aviation Operations and Training.  These specified missions include:<BR><BR>a.	Identify aircraft and aviation units utilizing the airfield.<BR>b.	Identify crash rescue/fire fighting/emergency response units/teams organized to support flying activities.<BR>c.	Identify engineer construction units/teams organized to provide runway damage repair and airfield construction/improvements.<BR>d.	Identify airfield defense forces organized to provide security/force protection.<BR>e.	Identify ATC services required for aviation flying activities.<BR>f.	Identify refuel and armament services required for aviation units/elements.<BR>g.	Identify joint, coalition, host nation units, activities, departments, and cells supported or supporting airfield operations.<BR>h.	Identify and validate aircraft support requirements.<BR>i.	Coordinate airfield parking plan with aviation units.<BR>j.	Coordinate flight planning and operations with aviation units.<BR>k.	Coordinate Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) abatement and other wildlife prevention plans.<BR>l.	Coordinate crash rescue/fire fighting services with emergency response.<BR>m.

<p>(3)Description of supplies/services.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>De-install existing Hirsch Card Reader from the Second floor office and re-install to a new office on the 1st floor door location on the north side. Also install new electric strike and mounting box.</p>
<p>Install Door Release Button for FSDO Reception to Open Office Area.<br />Install Door Release Button to open intercom reception door to Main Lobby area.<br />Install two Door Release Buttons for FSDO office area at two stations to open door hallway.<br />Install Door Release Button for CMO Reception to open office area.<br />Install Door Release Button for IFO Reception to open office area.</p>
<p>1 Electric Strike<br />1 Hirsch Mount Box (MB2)<br />1 Hirsch Slope Bracke (UMK-SLOPE)<br />SSJ 029P-10</p>
<p>6 Door Release Push Buttons<br />1 Programming and Intergration into existing system</p>
<p>All work to include all needed parts, wiring, travel and labor to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>(4)Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253&copy; implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>(5)Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>Defender Security performed the original security installation systems therefore provided maintenance/warranty to the systems until October 2011. In order to continue to maintain the warranty of the original work Defender Security is the only <br />SSJ NO. 029P-10</p>
<p>authorized vendor to make modifications/add-on to the system in order to ensure all stipulations of the warranty are adhered to.</p>
<p>(6)Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>Based on research conducted to the best knowledge of the government, no other vendor can perform the add-on without voiding the existing warranty and maintenance agreement already in place.</p>
<p>(7)Determination by the Contracting Office that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>As this expansion effort is an extension of current system capabilities, Defender Security has provided rates consistent with the labor and material costs awarded on the original contract, which were previously found to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(8)Description of market research. <br />SSJ NO. 029P-10</p>
<p>Another vendor has refused to warranty the original work because they did not install the existing security equipment. Therefore Defender Security is the only company that can provide the add-on/expansion work.</p>
<p>(9)Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration requires continuous maintenance/warranty on security systems and cannot afford to breach the existing warranty</p>
