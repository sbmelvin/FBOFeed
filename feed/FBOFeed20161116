<DESC><strong>Description:</strong><br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Training Aircraft Division, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for one (1) year of Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services to DynCorp International, LLC, 13500 Heritage Parkway, Fort Worth, Texas 76177. Market research was conducted and it has been determined this one-year effort is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The COMBS contract will provide supply chain management services supporting the JPATS fleet of 743 T-6 A/B/D aircraft at 12 locations for one year. The US Air Force (USAF) is designated as lead service for the jointly funded (Air Force, Navy, Army) JPATS program. The JPATS users include USAF Air Education and Training Command (AETC), US Navy (USN) Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA), US Army (USA) Aviation Flight Test Directorate (AFTD). COMBS services include but are not limited to; stock, store, issue, procure/deliver, repair, replenishment and return to service of aircraft material and equipment in support of the users' annual flying hour program. The contractor will also provide required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) serviceability documentation and management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) supplied during the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>DynCorp International provides highly specialized COMBS services in support of three variations of the T-6 aircraft, for USAF, USN, USA, at twelve different military installations. DynCorp International is responsible to issue all common and unique material/equipment for the three T-6 variations, to ensure that there are sufficient mission-capable aircraft to meet customer requirements. As the incumbent contractor, only DynCorp International, LLC can provide the required highly specialized services, on 1 Nov 2016, at acceptable performance levels without causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. In order to transfer responsibility for COMBS services from the incumbent contractor to a new contractor, an overlapping transition period is necessary to ensure the contractor will meet the agency's requirements when full performance begins. Such a transition period would create a gap in service resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The intent of this follow-on contract is to prevent a break in service while allocating sufficient time to conduct a competitive source selection.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, not a solicitation. Responsible sources, however, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Air Force if received within 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice. Any respondent is to specify in its response whether it is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.</p>
<p>Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Any responses will be considered by this office before a final decision is made to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Nicholas Bisher, at (937) 255-0688 or e-mail: nicholas.bisher@us.af.mil or the Contracting Officer, John Seacrist at 937-656-7203 or e-mail: john.seacrist@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>DLA Aviation Richmond intends to issue a letter solicitation for this unrestricted requirement to procure multiple<br />sole source, part numbered items. This is a notification that a modification will be issued to add sole source NSNs<br />to the existing Aviall Corporate Contract number SPE4AX13D9427. The FOB point is origin and<br />inspection/acceptance is origin. DLA Aviation Richmond does not currently have an approved technical data<br />package available for these NSNs.<br />The following applies to some of the NSNs and will be addressed in the letter<br />Request for Proposal (RFP) which are: CSI, and export control.
<p>Surplus dealers and small business dealers and distributors having existing stocks of surplus or newly<br />manufactured material are invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus<br />certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material, or adequate traceability documentation to show<br />product is acceptable. In addition, responders should identify quantity available and price. DLA will consider all<br />such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly manufactured<br />inventory is in the best interest of the government.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer<br />(OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer<br />prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response<br />should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate<br />traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their<br />equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should<br />identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In<br />addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be<br />forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (michael.massello@dla.mil). The Government<br />may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best<br />interest of the Government.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted to David Whitby at david.whitby@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Attachment List contains the NSNs and P/N's that will be procured under this notice. NSNs may ultimately get<br />removed from this list as review of the NSNs are conducted.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a pre-solicitation / non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract or purchase order without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the Information Technology and Applications Center (ITAC) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) to Subject7, Inc., 11121 Stackhouse Ct., Potomac, MD 20854 to provide Proof by Subject7 software licenses with annual maintenance, annual maintenance renewal for twenty-one (21) existing licenses and 200 hours of on-site support.</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541511, with a size standard of $27.5M.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13.5-Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial items at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000) and not exceeding $7 million.</p>
<p><br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 -Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide annual maintenance for 21 users of Proof by Subject7, a scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud-based test automation platform, and provide six (06) additional licenses with annual maintenance, and 200 hours of on-site support.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Proof by Subject7 was approved by the NHLBI Chief Information Officer for procurement back in 2014, as a solution to meeting the new security standard for application and web mods because Proof is a product that allows test authoring through a wizard-driven web interface and performs functional, regression, and acceptance testing for software applications. No infrastructure, customization, or scripting language is required to use this platform. The software can start writing tests using a browser of choice in a matter of minutes and start running the tests with integrated reporting capabilities. The capability of the product to enable staff to begin testing quickly during each round of testing is extremely beneficial to ITAC because it prevents delays in final releases. This acquisition is a request for more user licenses with maintenance and the inclusion of on-site support hours. This request also includes the maintenance renewal fees for all existing current licenses in order to have all maintenance renewals on the same twelve month renewal cycle. <br /><br />Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the institute with continued use of software that is used to test custom applications and web browsers in order to avoid unexpected problems or issues when upgrades occur. The NHLBI must have automated smoke tests established to enable broad testing of its custom applications in support of required security and functional patch upgrades. Smoke testing also needs to be performed on an array of targeted web browsers to uncover issues before browser upgrades occur. This acquisition will continue to satisfy the security requirements to perform complete and accurate testing of each application and browser modification using this proprietary software named Proof by Subject7.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this fixed price purchase order consists of a base period of twelve (12) months followed by four (04) consecutive twelve (12) month option periods.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>Proof by Subject7 was approved by the NHLBI Chief Information Officer for procurement back in 2014, as a solution to meeting the new security standard for application and web mods because Proof is a product that allows test authoring through a wizard-driven web interface and performs functional, regression, and acceptance testing for software applications. No infrastructure, customization, or scripting language is required to use this platform. The software can start writing tests using a browser of choice in a matter of minutes and start running the tests with integrated reporting capabilities. The capability of the product to enable staff to begin testing quickly during each round of testing is extremely beneficial to ITAC because it prevents delays in final releases. This acquisition is a request for more user licenses with maintenance and the inclusion of on-site support hours. This request also includes the maintenance renewal fees for all existing current licenses in order to have all maintenance renewals on the same twelve month renewal cycle. <br />Other Important Considerations</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the software is the only source for Proof by Subject7. There are no other vendors that sell this proprietary software and no other sources from which to procure these licenses.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research, specifically the review and evaluation of the responses to the sources sought notice published in the FedBizOpps on November 4, 2016, NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2017-018-RMD, Proof by Subject7 Software Licenses and Maintenance Renewal.</p>
<p>The intended source for this requirement is Subject7, Inc., 11121 Stackhouse Court, Potomac, MD 20854. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the Information Technology and Applications Center (ITAC), within the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), with additional software licenses and the continued use of the specialized software being used to comply with recently established security requirements for custom applications and web browsers to be tested before they are upgraded, patched, or modified, in order to prevent unexpected problems and/or issues with these applications and web browsers once they are upgraded, patched, or modified. The intended source is the manufacturer of the proprietary software (Proof) and has no resellers at this time. There are no other vendors that sell this proprietary software and no other sources from which to procure these licenses other than the manufacturer, Subject7, Inc.<br /><br />CLOSING STATEMENT</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Leica Microsystems Inc., 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL, 60089-6622, to upgrade NHLBI's current SP5 microscope system to an SP8 MP model.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The focus of NHLBI's Muscle Energetics Laboratory is to determine how mitochondria are optimized within muscle cells to help maintain energy homeostasis during the large change in energy demand caused by muscle contraction. Recently, the laboratory has demonstrated that skeletal muscle mitochondria form a highly connected network resembling that of an electrical power grid, and, indeed, were capable of electrical conduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential throughout the cell. The discovery of this rapid energy distribution mechanism overturned longstanding ideas regarding diffusion as the primary energy distribution pathway in skeletal muscle. Current work in this area is focused on providing a better understanding of the regulation and development of these mitochondrial networks as well as their role in overall muscle function.</p>
<p>Despite much interest, control of mitochondrial function in vivo remains largely unclear as direct measures of mitochondrial enzymes in live animals have been limited. As a result, another major focus of the lab is to develop and utilize novel, direct measurements of in vivo mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle under different workloads. The goal of these studies is to unravel the signaling cascade involved in the upregulation of mitochondrial energy conversion during muscle contraction.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Muscle Energetics Laboratory is currently using a confocal microscope-a Leica SP5 confocal/multi-photon live animal imaging system-that is outdated and needs to be replaced. The laboratory has determined that the best course of action is to upgrade the current SP5 system to an SP8 MP model at a fraction of the cost to purchase a new SP8 MP system altogether. This upgrade will allow the lab to continue developing cutting edge live animal imaging techniques and significantly increase its capabilities for imaging live cells and tissue sections. The updated microscope system will play a vital part in investigating the relationships between skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and function in the lab.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall upgrade the Muscle Energetics Laboratory's SP5 confocal microscope to an SP8 MP system. Specifically, the contractor shall replace the lab's DM6 CFS Stand (NHLBI Decal # 01839186), premium workstation (CPU) (NHLBI Decal # 01839162), and monitor (NHLBI Decal # 01839161) with the following SP8 components:</p>
<p>&bull;	DM6 CFS Stand<br />&bull;	Optical Outfit<br />&bull;	Scan optics module VISIR with rotation<br />&bull;	Tandem scanner 8 kHz<br />&bull;	SP8 LIAchroics Compact RGB<br />&bull;	One Internal Detector Channel (PMT)<br />&bull;	Two Internal Detector Channels (HyD)<br />&bull;	Confocal Lasers 405 nm, 488 nm, 552 nm and 638 nm<br />&bull;	IR prepard (without IR Laser)<br />&bull;	Custom Dual Beam Routing for MaiTai HP DeepSee (2)<br />&bull;	Custom Quad Module for MicroMirror plus Hyd RLD 2ch (system has HyD 2Ch)<br />&bull;	Premium Workstation, Monitor<br />&bull;	Beam Splitter Quad LP 560nm<br />&bull;	Beam Splitter Quad LP 505nm<br />&bull;	Beam Splitter Quad Empty (for customization)</p>
<p>In addition to providing these components, the contractor shall trade-in the old SP5 Confocal components for cost savings towards the new components.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>Leica Microsystems, Inc. is the only company capable of performing this trade-in/upgrade. No other company possesses the technology, equipment and materials necessary to safely and accurately convert a Leica SP5 system to an SP8 system. This trade-in represents a significant cost-savings to the Government as Leica is offering $121,233.54 off of the purchase price of these new SP8 components with the trade-in of the old SP5 components. As a result, no other company is capable of meeting the work requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a negotiated procurement for the <strong>Design/Build</strong> contract for construction of the new Building 54 as part of Phase 2 for the Consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, DC. The scope will include design/build efforts from approximately 30% bridging documents and construction management for the CUP2 Building.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The Project will consist of the design and construction of the new building, localized soils stabilization efforts for several adjacent historic buildings, structural monitoring of the historic buildings and the installation of the related pads and mechanical and electrical equipment. Commissioning will also be part of the project. Building 54 is approximately 80,000 sf with 3-levels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The St Elizabeths site is approximately 176 acres and is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) site containing primarily office space and parking structures with some special buildings for conferences and food service.

<RESPDATE>120216
<CONTACT>David J. Earl, Contracting Officer, Phone 9372553905, Email david.earl@us.af.mil - Steve Godby, Contracting Officer, Phone 9372553748, Email steven.godby@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>***See attached document for full details regarding this notice*** <br /><br />This is an SSS/RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>For the B-2 Training System (TS), the Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise and capabilities to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide operations, maintenance, and sustainment (OM&amp;S) support including: Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), Training System Support Center (TSSC), modifications/upgrades, courseware and instruction for a period of up to twelve (12) months (a base period of 6-months plus two, 3-month options). The B-2 TS consists of Aircrew Training System (ATS) and Maintenance Training System (MTS). The Government is currently contemplating the acquisition strategy for the B-2 TS re-compete action and this sources sought synopsis serves as market research to identify support services which may be available following the conclusion of the existing B-2 TS contract on 31 December 2017. Results of the market research will determine the approach for interim continued support.</p>
<p>For this acquisition, potential sources must be able to design, develop, implement, test, install, and manage required concurrency, fidelity hardware/software upgrades. Concurrency upgrades match ATS and MTS capability to the weapon system and core trainer unique modifications and upgrades are improvements (e.g., due to obsolescence, training quality requirements, reliability requirements, etc.) to the ATSs and MTSs.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15 contract. Potential sources must have the required personnel available with required Special Access Program (SAP) clearances and a Defense Security Services (DSS) accredited facility with physical security at the Secret Special Access Program level available for the B-2 Training System Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) to start work in the 1st Quarter of Calendar Year 2018.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the FAR. Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this SSS/RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS/RFI.</p>
<p>Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this SSS/RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Formal responses should be e-mailed to steven.godby@us.af.mil, david.earl@us.af.mil and sarah.chelgren-brooks.2@us.af.mil. REQUEST RESPONSES NLT COB 2 December 2016. Also, please mail an original signed copy of your response, postmarked on or before the same date, to:</p>

<DESC>The PM WIN-T architecture developed a network-centric waveform to be used in modems for insertion into the WIN-T SATCOM terminals in accordance with evolving Army Concept of Operations (CONOPS) schedules.
<p>The Contractor shall provide the Network-Centric Waveform (NCW) modems: including the RMPM-1000 L-3 part number 1000-0001-7 or equivalent, and the MPM-2000 L-3 part number 1039-001-2 or equivalent. The Contractor shall include with each RMPM-1000 modem a six-foot standard commercial power cable to the Government. The Contractor shall optionally provide RMPM-1000 stacking cable to the Government. This equipment will be used during field operations and/or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCOs) and wartime deployments. The Contractor shall provide a quarterly status report (CDRL A001) showing how many units have been produced and shipped. The Contractor shall provide a test report/data (CDRL A002) for each modem delivered under this contract, and include such test data with each modem shipped. The Contractor shall maintain the test report/data and provide it to the Government upon request.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver NCW modems at a minimum rate of 25 per month, beginning 150 days ARO. For all NCW modems purchased as options under this SOW, the delivery for the modems of any such option order shall be at a minimum rate of 25 per month starting 150 days ARO or starting the month after the last due date of any modems previously ordered under this SOW, whichever is later; that is, delivery dates shall not be concurrent or overlap with previous orders under this SOW.</p>
<p>All the hardware components detailed in this SOW are critical components that enable interoperability among PM WIN-T satellite communications platforms, and SPAWAR organizations. The Contractor shall utilize the specified brand name equipment or provide equivalent components that are equal to the named network-centric waveform items in form, fit and function; and shall require no changes of any sort to the aforementioned terminals in order for them to operate correctly. The use of the equivalent component shall not alter any certifications of the terminals, nor require any additional testing or certifications to be received in order for the Government to operate the terminals, nor require any wiring, configuration, mechanical or other changes to the terminals. In addition, any equivalent component shall operate in a logistically and economically feasible way, and not cause the Government to expend additional funds to accommodate the use of the equivalent component. Any equivalent component shall interoperate seamlessly in any established NCW network referenced in section 2.4 of the SOW.</p>
<p>We request that sources capable of meeting the Government's requirements above and in the SOW provide a white paper of no more than 25 pages that addresses their ability to provide the subject services. All information shall be submitted no later than 12:00PM EST on 01 Dec 2016 to Kevin Andralliski, ACC-APG, at kevin.o.andralliski.civ@mail.mil.</p>

The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for Full Food Services on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price bridge contract to the Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired for Full Food Services. The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code is: 722310 - Industry comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing food services at institutional, governmental, commercial, or industrial locations with an associated small business size standard of $38.5M.</p>
<p><br />In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solution solutions. Also contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2269, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the Sources Sought Synopsis. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>2. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, identify business size (large business or a small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>5. Information to help determine if the requirement (item or service) is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties, etc.</p>
<p>6. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition, including competition among small business concerns.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the Army's approach to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

Other SDVOSB firms having a working office within a 300 mile radius from 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY may submit SF 330 s for consideration, to the Contracting Officer at Mark.Simonson@va.gov by 4:30 PM EST, December 5, 2016.

The project is to renovate the lab waiting and blood draw areas to improve process flow and to update the dÃ©cor. This upgrade will include, but not be limited to: re-locating the current bathroom, increasing the capacity of the waiting room, expanding the blood draw room to include two stations and increasing privacy, modernize the dÃ©cor of the area and replace/upgrade the wayfinding signage. A work flow study is to be done that confirms not only does the proposed layout achieves the desired results but also analyzes the blood testing and processing areas for efficient flow. The results of this study are to be documented in a written report. All designs will follow, but are not limited to, VA Space Planning Specifications, in conjunction with the VA Master specifications as outlined in VA Handbook 7610.  The design will also be done to ensure that the design meets all the requirements/specifications for local, state, and federal codes.  The estimated construction cost for the design must fall within the VA budget.

All designs will follow the National Electric Code, and specifications for VA construction. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget.   

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The last known upgrade to these facilities was done in the seventies. The current layout is small for the number of patients they need to serve and doesn t lend itself well to perform the testing required these days. Adequate privacy and appearance are also issues.

<DESC>CONTACT CENTER QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY OFFICE OF SECURITY PROGRAMS, WASHINGTON, DC
<p>1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br />The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Office of Consumer Response (CR) is seeking sources to assist the CFPB in its efforts to develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services in its contact center.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>2.1 Stakeholder Services Background<br />Stakeholder Services facilitates the intake of consumer communications via telephone, efax, mail, and referral (email, API, paper), and as appropriate, responds to, routes, addresses, manages, and analyzes consumer submissions. Stakeholder Services supports consumers and other stakeholders by providing accurate answers to questions; proficiently handling submissions; and, responsibly managing portals and supporting other tools that promote the sharing of data with external parties.<br />Stakeholder Services handles submissions regarding many financial products and service topics across multiple channels and in accordance with CFPB business processes. The consumers (direct and third party) and non-consumers (institution, government users) will reach out to the CFPB across multiple channels (e.g., phone, referral [electronic or paper transfer of submission from other agency], email, web chat, web, fax, mail) and generate submissions (complaints, inquiries, and feedback) regarding many topics. Stakeholder Services and its outsourced Consumer Resource Center (CRC) utilize CFPB pre-approved scripts, job aids, and other content to handle these submissions.<br />Stakeholder Services has historically provided all staff necessary to perform an independent quality monitoring program of its Staff and Contractor's quality of service. The demand for Quality Assurance (QA) is quickly outgrowing the size of current Federal staff so CFPB requires the assistance of a third-party staff to conduct its independent quality monitoring program. Outsourcing the individual inspection activities, as well as engaging an industry expert to make recommendations to improve the CFPB quality of service, will allow Federal staff to focus on review, analysis and implementation of findings and recommendations.</p>
<p>2.2 Stakeholder Services Quality Assurance Approach<br />Typically a QA process grades against a long list of boxes to check and recipients are coached only in a remedial context. Those scored often respond by internalizing an attitude of fear: fear of getting into trouble, and fear of losing their job. These conditions do great damage to the ability of staff and contractors to do their best work. Alternatively Stakeholder Services prefers to focus on reinforcing good behavior, acknowledging outstanding behavior, and addressing deficiencies with growth strategies.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Stakeholder Services Measurement of Quality<br />For CFPB, the purpose of the quality scorecard should be to create confident staff and contractors that are better able to focus on doing quality work. Staff and contractors are assessed on their ability to perform to standards, as defined and supported through growth-based training and documented processes.<br />Staff and contractors will be measured on two areas: (1) following operational processes and (2) promoting better consumer outcomes. There is a short list of operational processes and rules that need to be followed by staff and contractors to ensure complaints and consumer information is handled properly. Contact Center Consumer Guides (CG), for example, are measured on important skills, such as active listening, problem solving, active-speaking and consumer finance knowledge. The Quality Scorecards are an opportunity for staff and contractors to engage with their supervisors, QA peers and CFPB staff to have honest conversations on ways of encouraging growth and better performance. The Quality Scorecards are an opportunity for staff and contractors to identify their strengths and also areas for improvement. For example, if staff and contractors are high-achievers in one skill area, this could represent an opportunity to be recognized with a certificate and to be a workplace leader and mentor others. If staff and contractors are struggling in a skill area, this would identify a need for training or coaching, perhaps from high-achieving staff and contractors in that area. The Bureau expects that over time all staff and contractors should improve along these metrics and that Stakeholder Services and the Consumer Resource Center (CRC) will develop appropriate coaching, training and other opportunities with assistance from the Bureau to help staff and contractors grow in their roles.<br />As part of its QA processes, the Contractor shall monitor and evaluate its Stakeholder Services and the Consumer Resource Center (CRC) activities using defined scorecards. The staff and contractors are not to know which activities are being screened. The Contractor shall monitor the number of staff and contractors activities consistent with its proposal. Additionally, the Contractor shall hold calibrations sessions with CFPB personnel every two weeks to ensure its scoring approach is consistent with CFPB standards.</p>
<p>2.2.2 Stakeholder Services Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan<br />The Contractor shall develop and maintain an effective Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to ensure services are performed in accordance with the contract and that is aligned with the quality management component of the PMP. The Contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services. The Contractors shall provide a QASP NLT 60 calendar days after award, and update it to accommodate future organization, process, and technology changes as requested by the CFPB. Within the QASP, the Contractor shall describe its approach to ensure successful delivery of the services and Service Level Agreements (SLA) outlined in the contract. The QASP shall include the following sections:<br />(a) QA Roles and Responsibilities<br />(b) QA Activities - all processes that will be utilized to monitor performance<br />(c) QA Activity Assessment - including the scoring rubric (e.g., scorecard) to measure performance<br />(d) Action Plans<br />(e) How to Leverage QA Data (in operations, training, content development, etc.)<br />(f) QA Reports</p>
<p>2.3 Stakeholder Services Scope<br />Scope includes program development, implementation, and ongoing operations.</p>
<p>2.3.1 Define QA Sampling Approach per Process <br />Currently defined processes are evaluated using specific scorecards based on a random sample of the total number of transactions per month using historical data to determine the number of monitored consumer interactions required to meet a statistically valid sample size. For example, based on 65,000 estimated monthly contacts with a confidence level of 95% and confidence interval of 5 (also known as plus or minus), a total of 382 interactions would need to monitored and scored. <br />We will be looking to the Contractor to apply their expertise to provide recommendations for the QA sampling approach based on their experience and industry best practices. Methods of surveillance may include: <br />&bull; Random Monitoring <br />&bull; Targeted Inspection<br />&bull; Process specific sample sizes based on % confidence levels<br />&bull; Frequency of Inspection (daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports)</p>
<p>2.3.2 Review, Refine and/or Define QA Scorecards <br />There are seven (7) processes identified for quality review within Stakeholder Services and the CRC. Many have existing QA scorecards, but some do not. The Contractor will assist CFPB with defining scorecards where needed. The Contractor shall recommend changes to QA scorecards and processes based on their experience and industry best practices.</p>
<p>2.3.3 Monitor Processes and Complete QA Scorecards<br />As part of its QA processes, the Contractor shall monitor and evaluate its CG interactions using a defined scorecard. The CGs are not to know which interactions are being screened. The Contractor shall monitor the number of CG interactions consistent with its proposal. Additionally, the Contractor shall hold calibrations sessions with CFPB personnel every two weeks to ensure its scoring approach is consistent with CFPB standards.</p>
<p>2.3.3.1 Contact Center Calls QA<br />Consumers contact the CFPB via phone to submit and/or update complaints, as well as to request responses to inquiries, or to provide feedback. When processing a submission over the phone the CRC documents the caller's contact and submission information in the CRM system and provides a resolution according to the Knowledge Management (KM) system and training.</p>
<p>2.3.3.2 Contact Center Data Entry QA<br />Consistent with CFPB business processes, the CRC provides an address for the receipt of written correspondence (Fax, Paper, Email), and processes all inbound mail. Intake of incoming mail, email, and eFax is sorted and opened. Inbound mail is scanned (with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology), and transmitted through system integration from the CRC scanning system into the CRM system and either associated with an existing submission or a new submission. All written correspondence is time and date stamped. In accordance with CFPB mail templates and business processes, the CRC sends the appropriate response receipt. The CRC scans all mail within one (1) business day of receipt. After scanning the mail, the CRC processes the submission in accordance with the type (as described in the submission handling process and CFPB business processes). Submissions have been an average of 14 pages. A normal page of text is around 4,000 characters. The typical handle time for reading, data entry, and attachment of the submissions has been 15 minutes per letter.</p>
<p>2.3.3.3 Routing <br />Stakeholder Services routes complaints to the company thru the routing process using the CRM system. When processing a complaint thru routing, Stakeholder Services: <br />(a) Reviews complaints for completeness and company named <br />(b) Determines need to reach out to submitter for additional information <br />(c) Determines company and boarding status <br />(d) Determines if complaint should be referred to another regulator <br />(e) Routes complaints to appropriate destination</p>
<p>2.3.3.4 Complaint Triage<br />Stakeholder Services prepares complaints and companies for boarding thru the triage process using the CRM system. When processing a complaint thru triage, Stakeholder Services: <br />(a) Determines if the complaint should be associated with an existing pending company <br />(b) Routes unmatched company names, abbreviations, misspellings, etc. to Boarding process for research <br />(c) May need to update routing tools as an alias/affiliate <br />(d) May need to start the boarding process as a pending company <br />(e) May be deemed as not appropriate for boarding or routing tools (referred to another regulator)</p>
<p>2.3.3.5 Portal Boarding<br />In order to send complaints to Companies, the CFPB must register the company within the CRM system. The process of registering is referred to as "boarding". Boarding requests are received when companies request to register with the CFPB, or when a request is generated as a result of a complaint completing the triage process. As part of the boarding process, Stakeholder Services utilizes the CRM system to: <br />(a) research company contact information using the internet, industry contacts, consumer information, company reports, bank reports, and other CFPB approved data sources <br />(b) Perform outreach to new, un-boarded companies <br />(c) Facilitate boarding process for new companies <br />(d) setup companies and Government entities in the CRM system <br />(e) provide access to company POCs</p>
<p>2.3.3.6 Portal Servicing<br />Once boarded the company may submit service requests or non-administrative responses via the CRM system. Handling these service requests is referred to as "servicing". Stakeholder Services provides the necessary personnel, technology, and infrastructure to execute both of these processes. As part of the servicing process, Stakeholder Services: <br />(a) Responds to boarded company operational and technical questions <br />(b) Ensures portal users have adequate information to view and respond to complaints <br />(c) Modifies the POC or contact information for the company <br />(d) Reviews and responds to the questions from companies <br />(e) Evaluates complaints returned by companies via administrative response categories <br />(f) Manages updates to the routing tools and organization tables <br />There are approximately 500 service tickets per month.</p>
<p>2.3.3.7 Scrubbing QA<br />Upon receiving a submission in the Scrubbing process, the CRC scrubs the PII of consumers from submissions based on guidance provided by CFPB. The CRC conducts an initial, second, and final QA review of each submission using the following process: <br />Step 1: The first CG scrubs the PII from the submission <br />Step 2: A second CG independently reviews the results of Step 1. If any PII is found, the CG returns the submission to the Step 1 CG to be re-scrubbed and then re-sent to Step 2. <br />Once complete, the CRC routes the submission to the appropriate queue in accordance with CFPB business processes.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Create Regular Analytical Reports, Findings, and Recommendations <br />At the end of each month, the Contractor will prepare a written report for Stakeholder Services summarizing the overall QA results. This written report and the supporting completed QA Monitoring Forms will become part of the Contractor's deliverables.</p>
<p>2.3.5 Regular Review Meetings <br />The Contractor will host in-depth reviews with the Stakeholder Services to outline the findings for the period. These meetings can be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly based on common agreement. However, the Contractor shall meet with the Stakeholder Services as often as required. The Contractor can request a special meeting to address any issues. The agenda of the meetings may include: <br />&bull; Monthly performance assessment data and trend analysis <br />&bull; Issues and concerns <br />&bull; Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends, including a corrective action plan analysis <br />&bull; Recommendations for improved efficiency and / or effectiveness <br />&bull; Issues arising from the performance monitoring processes</p>
<p>2.3.6 Suggest Improvements to Knowledgebase Based On QA Findings<br />Suggest improvements to Knowledgebase to address the lack of adherence to CFPB business processes, quality standards, or other issues highlighted by the CFPB, the Contractor's internal quality team, or other Contractor personnel.</p>
<p>2.3.7 Suggest Improvements to Procedures Based On QA Findings<br />Suggest proper procedures to address the lack of adherence to CFPB business processes, quality standards, or other issues highlighted by the CFPB, the Contractor's internal quality team, or other Contractor personnel.</p>
<p>2.3.8 Suggest Improvements to Training Based On QA Findings<br />Suggest improvements to training to address the lack of adherence to CFPB business processes, quality standards, or other issues highlighted by the CFPB, the Contractor's internal quality team, or other Contractor personnel.</p>
<p>2.3.9 Participate in Monitoring Calibrations <br />In an effort to create consistent scoring between the Contractor and CFPB, the Contractor shall hold calibrations sessions with CFPB personnel every two (2) weeks to ensure its scoring approach is consistent with CFPB standards. Regular calibrations sessions should decrease the number of potential disputes which lessens the amount of work for Stakeholder Services, the CRC, and the Contractor.</p>

</span></span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Background: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This SMSP Performance Work Statement (PWS) covers broad requirements for contractor-provided products and services to create, plan, produce, and place advertising in a variety of media including, but not limited to: classified, out-of-home, events/venue based, theater, online/search, social media and wireless advertising for participating States. The ARNG- HRR Marketing branch oversees and manages the program at the national level. The SMSP contractor will utilize existing Army National Guard-approved creative materials as a basis for development of customized/localized media-type-specific creative materials for placement in the individual States and U.S. Territories. States maintain control over their media decisions and the contracted agency tailors their program to the State's needs. No other government agency has this requirement to the state level, making the task more complex than a larger, centralized national advertising contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The following is attached for reference: the draft PWS.</span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 2.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This notice is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers or proposals at this time.

This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal and no award will be made as a result of this sources sought notice. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents. The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Please provide a capability statement not to exceed ten (10) pages; which details relevant experience as a prime contract holder which should include; planning, purchasing and placement of local advertising, similar experience in regards to both size (dollar value) and scope, business size, applicable contract vehicles and notice of your intent to propose on this requirement by 5:00 PM (EDT),&nbsp;7 December 2016.</span></p>

<p><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of fabricating and installing one underwater saw for cutting fuel elements and shim arm assemblies. The NCNR utilizes a 20 MW reactor to provide neutrons to the scientific community. The spent irradiated fuel assemblies and regulating rods (shim arms) from the NIST reactor (NBSR) are stored in the NBSR spent fuel pool prior to disposal. The spent fuel and shim arm assemblies are cut into predetermined sized pieces prior to packaging and shipping. Currently, reactor operations use two saws to do the cutting. One for fuel assemblies and one for shim arm assemblies. It is highly desirable to simplify this process by having a new saw designed and built that can cut both fuel element and shim arm assemblies in a vertical position; be easily loaded and unloaded; be located permanently in the pool; and be able to contain and collect the machining debris.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement shall be 12 months from award of contract.</p>
<p>Instructions to Responders: <br />Interested parties that can fabricate and install an underwater saw for the requirement above are requested to email a detailed capabilities statement describing their abilities to donald.collie@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br />1. Describe in detail at least two (2) similar projects that have been completed within the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>2. Contractor must demonstrate their ability to perform a factory acceptance test which includes demonstrating the operation of the saw by cutting a minimum of two (2) mockup fuel elements and two (2) mockup shim arms.</p>
<p>3. Any other relevant information that the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Other Information:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541330 as those domestic sources having annual receipts up to $15 million. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>After market research results are obtained, if a minimum of two (2) qualified small businesses are identified during market research stage, then any resulting competitive procurement may be considered for a small business set-aside.</p>

Three of these buildings house hospital departments and services. These include the Warren Grant Magnuson Building, the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC). National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) defined occupancies for Health Care and Ambulatory Health Care account for 1.49 million square feet of space within the complex. In addition, the clinics as partners in care account for 1.3 million square feet. The NIH CC employs approximately 2,000 full time employees across 30 different departments. The hospital is a 200 bed hospital with 15 outpatient (OP) clinics and 82 day-hospital stations.<br /><br />A Patient Call (Nurse Call) Communication System is required for routine communication between a patient and clinical staff and amongst clinical staff. As the primary concern is to facilitate improved communication with and about the patient, for the purposes of this contract, the system will be referred to as the Patient Call Communication System. The Patient Call Communication System will include:<br /><br />a. A Patient Call (Nurse Call) System which allows the patient to communicate via Patient devices, including patient stations and emergency pull devices, to clinical staff through dome/corridor lights and staff call stations. The Nurse Call System will allow clinical staff to clinical staff communication via duty stations and overhead paging.<br /><br />b. A wireless phone solution that will integrate with the Patient Call (Nurse Call) System to enable direct communication between clinical staff and patient and clinical staff and clinical staff using the wireless phones. The system will have coverage in the three buildings.<br /><br />c. A system that supports patient safety notifications (e.g. fall alerts, IV pump alerts, etc.).<br /><br />An integrated Patient Call (Nurse Call) Communication System is required to manage communications between patient and nurse and amongst the clinical staff in order to minimize response time to patient calls, increase staff effectiveness and ensure patient safety. <br /><br /><strong>2.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /></span></strong><br />To replace the existing Nurse Call System and the current nurse communications integration with wireless devices with a new system which will be referred to as the Patient Call Communication System.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE:<br /></strong><br />1. The Contractor shall provide a Patient Call Communication System across the clinical environment that will cover the 200 bed facility and departments within the CRC building. Expansion to the outpatient clinics in the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Warren Grant Magnuson Building will be part of a second task. The Patient Call Communication System will include:<br /><br />a. A Nurse Call System which allows the patient to communicate via Patient devices, including patient stations and emergency pull devices, to clinical staff through dome/corridor lights and staff call stations. The Nurse Call System will allow clinical staff to clinical staff communication via duty stations and overhead paging.<br /><br />b. A wireless phone solution that will integrate with the Nurse Call System to enable direct communication between clinical staff and patient and clinical staff and clinical staff using the wireless phones. The system will have coverage in the three buildings.<br /><br />c. A system that supports patient safety notifications (e.g. fall alerts, IV pump alerts, etc.).<br /><br />2.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes.  Naval Supply Center (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolkâ€™s intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide contractor services in support of U. S. Fleet Cyber Command/U. S. Tenth Fleet Department Of Defense (DoD)  Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) Certification and Accreditation (C and A) responsibilities and functions and Risk Management Framework (RMF) Assessment and Authorization (A and A) responsibilities and functions.    DIACAP C and A/RMF A and A activities, under the purview of the FLTCYBERCOM Authorizing Official (AO), assess Navy IT compliance with statutes, federal and DoD/Department of Navy (DoN) directives, policies, instructions and orders.
  This announcement constitutes a sources sought for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and a contract will not be awarded from of this announcement. This announcement is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.

Anticipated NAICS Code:
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541519 with a small business size standard of $27.5M. The Government has not yet determined whether an existing strategically sourced vehicle will be used to satisfy this requirement. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to utilize Seaport-E, then the applicable NAICS code and size standard will be 541330 â€“ Engineering Services and $38.5 million.
 Respondents should provide their business size in both potential NAICS codes. 

Similar work is currently being performed by Tetrad Digital Integrity under contract N00189-14-D-0001.

Reponses to this Sources Sought request should reference N00189-17-R-CAAA and shall include the following information in this format: 

1. Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address. 

2. Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

3. If the services can be solicited from a GSA schedule, provide the GSA contract number.

4. If the services can be solicited from SeaPort, provide the contract number.

5. Size of business/category of small business - Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), HubZone, Woman-owned and/or Service Disabled Veteran-owned.

6.
 Capability statement displaying the contractorâ€™s ability to provide the services. A summary of past performance information may be included. If past performance information is provided, include only relevant past performance on the same/similar work within the last 5 years which was at least a year or more in duration.  Also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.

7. The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies. Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

8.
 Include any other supporting documentation desired.

9. Comments/suggestions on ways to improve the PWS are requested.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed five (5) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font size. 

Responses should be emailed to Thomas Armstrong at mailto:thomas.armstrong@navy.milby 1300 EST on 08 December 2016.  Again, this is not a request for a proposal.  Respondents will not be notified of the results.  Please note the information within this pre-solicitation synopsis will be updated and/or may change prior to an official synopsis/solicitation, if any is issued.

Attachment:

NOTE: Proprietary information should be clearly marked.
 The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. Again, this is not a request for a proposal.

The needed new contract will probably be awarded in the form of an umbrella-ordering-instrument-that is, either as a Blanket Purchase Agreement from a GSA Schedule, from which individual Calls could thereafter be issued, or else as an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contract, from which individual Task Orders could thereafter be issued.</span></p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), once known as White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG), has been in the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) arena since 1945. It is a tri-service Department of Defense range, managed by the United Stated Army. White Sands Missile Range is a part of the US Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), which plans, conducts, and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluation, assessment, and experiments to provide essential information to soldiers and into the hands of acquisition decision makers supporting the American warfighter. The Mission Support Services (MSS) contract supports the test and training missions by augmenting the short-staffed Government workforce with contractor personnel. The MSS contractor provides non-personal engineering and technical services to support operation and developmental testing for Department of Defense (DoD) program offices at WSMR and on occasion, at various CONUS and overseas locations. Mission support has historically consisted of services in the functional areas of Radar, Optics, Timing, Telemetry, Global Positioning System Instrumentation Systems, Aerial Cable, Nuclear Effects, Communication Electronic Services, Audio/Visual Information Services, Material Test Services, Remote Data Acquisition System, Inter-Range Control Center, High Speed Test Track and Engineering Services. The performance based work statement (PWS) identifies support for these major task areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Aerial Cable Range<br />&bull; Applied Environments (Vibration, Rain, Temperature Test Facilities)<br />&bull; Data Reduction<br />&bull; Directed Energy (High Energy Laser and High Power Microwave)<br />&bull; Dynamics<br />&bull; Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3 Testing) <br />&bull; Flight Termination<br />&bull; Frequency Surveillance<br />&bull; Global Positioning System (GPS)<br />&bull; Mathematical Computations<br />&bull; Meteorology<br />&bull; Munitions<br />&bull; Net-Centric Test Capabilities<br />&bull; Nuclear Effects<br />&bull; Optics<br />&bull; Radar<br />&bull; Range Communications <br />&bull; Real Time Data Processing and Visualization<br />&bull; Real Time Visualization<br />&bull; Software Development<br />&bull; Technical and Engineering Services<br />&bull; Telemetry<br />&bull; Timing<br />&bull; Urban Test Capabilities</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to collect industry comments on the DRAFT PWS attached and responses to questions below. Comments and suggestions on the attached DRAFT PWS will be evaluated on their own merit and considered for inclusion to the final product. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI and responses will be treated as information only.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS: <br />While the Government is not constraining interested parties on which aspects of the PWS they can comment, the following questions should be considered as part of your response:</p>
<p>1. The Government is considering a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (Term Form) contract with a government defined Level of Effort (LOE) for this contract. LOE may be expressed in terms of labor hours by labor category which may be adjusted throughout the life of the contract to support changes in operation tempo at WSMR. Considering the PWS, does industry have any issues with this type of contract approach?</p>
<p>2. The Government is seeking to streamline the technical evaluation process. Considering the DRAFT PWS, what are some measurable streamlining techniques the Government should consider?</p>
<p>3. Considering the magnitude of the PWS, how much time should be allotted for proposal submissions?</p>
<p>4. If oral proposals are used, how much time should be allotted?</p>
<p>5. If a site visit is part of the solicitation; would industry be interested in one-on-one meetings with the Government? If Yes, how long should these sessions be?</p>
<p>6. Of the entire scope of work presented in the DRAFT PWS, please identify the overall Small Business participation percentage that you believe should be required by the Government. (Note: No Small Business subcategory specification is necessary). Please support your percentage with a brief rationale.</p>
<p>7. Are there any areas of the PWS that industry would consider for performance by a Small Business Partner or Subcontractor?</p>
<p>8. Based on the DRAFT PWS and experience in this industry, are there any additional functional areas that would optimize performance that should be considered for inclusion/exclusion to the PWS?</p>
<p>9. Based on the DRAFT PWS and experience in this industry, how should the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) be structured?</p>
<p>10.Is there any area of the PWS that appears unduly burdensome to either the Government or contractor that would inhibit superior performance?</p>
<p>11.Do any of the PWS categories introduce any potential risks that would impact successful contract execution?</p>
<p>12.Are there any areas of the PWS where it appears the Government has failed to adequately set forth the stated requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner?</p>
<p>13.Do any areas of the PWS standout as significant drivers of cost or complexity? Please explain.</p>
<p>14.Do any areas of the PWS that industry believes will hinder competition?</p>
<p>15.Please note any other PWS comments/suggestions recommended. Please note the section and paragraph number when providing your comments. If a comment is general and applies to the entire PWS, please so state.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>

<DESC>PUBLIC NOTIFICATION

This notification is in response to questions received from industry regarding Public Announcement - Pre-SIR- Office of Security & Hazardous Safety (ASH) (Solicitation #25137), 
and Market Survey- ASH Fingerprinting Services (Solicitation #25138).

Question 1:  Will the ASH Fingerprinting Services contract include any fingerprinting Required under the ASH contract? 

FAA Response:  The ASH Fingerprinting Services (Solicitation #25138) contract is separate from the Pre-SIR- Office of Security & Hazardous Safety (ASH) (Solicitation #25137). There is no overlap of services.

Question 2:  Given the early announcement of the two-tiered procurement process for ASH, Do you anticipate: 

a. Releasing an RFI or Market Survey to structure the small business tier, and
b. Competing this contract earlier than what would normally occur? 

FAA Response:

a. The RFI and Market Survey will be released but not to structure the small business tier, and 
b. It is intended to have released the final Screening Information Request (SIR) during FY17. 

Question 3. Are you anticipating making multiple awards for the small business and full & Open tier ASH awards? 

FAA Response:

Multiple awards for the small business and full & open tier ASH awards will not be made. 

THIS NOTIFICATION IS FOR INORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and it will not reimburse any entity for any costs related to responses to this announcement.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">With the growth in mobile devices, the Internet of Things and new electronics connecting formerly-isolated systems to the Internet comes new and rapidly evolving cybersecurity risks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Security professionals now consider protecting their systems against not only bad actors from outside the trusted network but also against malicious or incautious insiders and supply chains with potentially counterfeit parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, many electronic technologies are secured using encryption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Verification that a device can be used typically is performed by authenticating the user using passwords, biometrics or similar solutions. However, user verification protections have proven compromises, and the device components may themselves be compromised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current solutions usually increasing the time and effort needed to develop and perform a compromise - essentially trusting that a bad actor won't have or use the resources necessary to break the security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Security is usually layered according to risk, with more valuable systems generally secured with multiple layers of increasing security. However, "bad actors" with sufficient dedication, time, and resources have been known to compromise even systems deemed very secure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>LLNL's Intrinsic Use Control (IUC) technology significantly enhances the security of electronic devices and components within the device.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology is designed to protect electronics against not only the outsider with malicious intent but also the knowledgeable, skilled, privileged insider with malicious intent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IUC system can add more layers of security to existing competitive solutions and can significantly increase the time and effort required to compromise an IUC-secured system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's IUC system can be programmed to enable a variety of responses at a component level and at the device level if verification of the authenticity of any components fails.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system can also be set up so for centralized management - keeping the initial set-up of the device and its controls during operations separate and managed outside of the device's end user purview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For devices that may not require centralized controls, the IUC can be enabled to allow verified human operators to securely enable or disable the IUC system - an added benefit for device users who need reliable operations more than security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>LLNL's IUC offers a significant increase in security for electronic devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Advantages of the IUC include: 1) substantially lower risk of any undetected compromise compared to current solutions; 2) controls within the device to minimize the "insider threat risk", 3) tailorable functions if a device or component fails verification or if a verified operator wants to change device settings, and 4) centralized secure system management.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Atmospheric Research &amp; Analysis for the purchase of TEKRAN used equipment.
<p>ARL requests that the equipment described below be acquired using a noncompetitive procurement in support of OAR requirement for atmospheric chemical monitoring. ARL conducts short- and long-term research field intensives, as well as multi-year monitoring efforts to investigate source-receptor relationships in the atmosphere; characterize emission sources; study air-surface exchange processes responsible for pollutant removal; and document trends in atmospheric concentrations of important toxic pollutants.  Under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Congress mandated NOAA and the EPA to monitor levels of mercury in the atmosphere. ARL's research and monitoring activities fulfill that mandate and support NOAA's Strategic Plan for Weather and Water research.</p>
<p>The purchase price of the used equipment is approximately 10-20% of that of new instrumentation. It is the opinion of the requestor that the value of the component parts in each detector alone is greater than the acquisition price. This reduced acquisition price represents a considerable cost savings for the U.S. taxpayer.</p>

<CONTACT>Barbara G Shifflett, Phone 8654546515, Email barbara.shifflett@noaa.gov - Berry Berry
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Mr. Roland Draxler provide support for the ARL HYSPLIT model.  Period of performance:  Requirement is for a one year period plus one option year beginning on January 1, 2017.
<p>NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) conducts research on the development and improvement of atmospheric dispersion models. These models are used by NOAA in a variety of applications ranging from relatively infrequent events such as nuclear accidents and volcanic eruptions to more routine air quality simulations of smoke from wild fires or airborne fine particulate from dust storms. The HYSPLIT model is the main modeling tool developed at ARL for these kinds of applications. The research supporting the development of this model is based on the continuous addition of new modules representing the most recent scientific advances in transport and dispersion simulations. The main goals of this contract are to improve the HYSPLIT model's user interface and develop its training materials. This work requires deep knowledge of HYSPLIT's principles of operation, and familiarity with the different model applications. ARL is seeking a part time consultant that can provide advice and assistance in the development and addition of (1) algorithms to compute air concentrations simultaneously on both polar and cartesian grid systems, (2) a method to convert Gaussian plumes used for short-range applications into a series of three dimensional particles that can be used for longer-range simulations, (3) new STILT model features into the HYSPLIT code. STILT is a version of HYSPLIT customized for source attribution studies, (4) new and updated training materials that can be used by participants in the annual HYSPLIT workshop, (5) and participate in the annual HYSPLIT workshop as an instructor.  The consultant should also be available intermittently to participate in conference calls and face-to-face meetings as needed by ARL scientists.  The consultant is not required to be on-site except for the intermittent meetings and participation in the annual workshop.  The advice provided by the consultant will be in the form of computer software, web pages, written reports, telephone, and direct meetings. The consultant is responsible for their own computing requirements. No access to government computers will be provided.  ARL scientists will integrate the consultant's work products into ARL's computing environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed<br />1)	Development of algorithms to compute air concentrations simultaneously on both polar and cartesian grid systems. The current model only supports one grid option per simulation.  Most post-processing programs only work with cartesian grids.<br />2)	Develop a method to convert Gaussian plumes used for short-range applications into a series of three dimensional particles that can be used for longer-range simulations.<br />3)	Provide advice on the incorporation of additional STILT model features into the HYSPLIT code. STILT is a version of HYSPLIT customized for source attribution studies.<br />4)	Update the content of the annual HYSPLIT workshop based upon user and staff comments from the last workshop.  The content needs to be reorganized to support its expansion from three to four days. The annual HYSPLIT workshop relies upon approximately 88 web pages of technical material describing the theory and operation of HYSPLIT using scripted examples.<br />5)	The consultant should be available for the entire HYSPLIT workshop (4 days) to provide instruction to the workshop participants on any of the sections as required by ARL.<br />6)	ARL may request the participation of the consultant in meetings, in-person, by telephone, or through web conference calls to discuss the development of the existing tasks or to solicit advice on other dispersion model related issues.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />&bull;	Brief quarterly reports summarizing work done in the previous quarter.</p>

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for an opportunity for a novel molecular biology cloning system for DNA assembly.  The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through December 30, 2016.
<p>ORNL researchers have engineered an innovative cloning system for flexible DNA assembly from universal libraries to generate multi-gene constructs (DNA synthesis).  This cloning system adopts a pre-defined three nucleotides (TNT) signature and a buffer system for a quick one-pot reaction.  The all-inclusive and ultra-flexible TNT-cloning system assembles functional constructs from a universal library that automatically maintains open reading frames (ORFs) and does not require linkers, adaptors, sequence homology, amplification or mutation of DNA fragments in order to work properly.  The enhanced buffer formulation provides the capability for testing, and sharing, complex multi-gene circuitry composed from a variety of DNA fragments.</p>
<p>The system has also been engineered to shuttle between different biological systems.  The easily transferable platform can be used to assemble the gene construct from a randomized library in vectors ready for transformation in a variety of hosts including bacteria, yeast, plant, and mammalian cells.</p>
<p>This technology offers gene assembly the power of harnessing large randomized libraries while also allowing for specific DNA building blocks to be catalogued for ease of access in the future or among research communities.  In addition, the TNT-cloning system was specifically designed with the following advantages:<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Handles Large DNA Constructs- compatible with large nucleotide cassettes &gt;50 kb in length (12kb fragments tested, ORNL).<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Highly Randomized and Populated Libraries- engineered to quickly assemble and select from large randomized libraries with reduced selection rounds.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Gene Assembly Speed- the design streamlines steps for a system that is up to 80% faster than other assembly systems.  Efficiency in steps and cloning speed increases with the number of assemblies. Use of high throughput and robotics has been validated with no drop in efficiency.</p>
<p>This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.</p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology.  If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.</p>
<p>Please contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865.574.4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov, with any questions and to obtain a license application for this opportunity.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Health Affairs (OHA) Biowatch Program and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Chemical Biological Defense ( CBD) will host an Industry Day Event to provide additional information on the program and the Technology Demonstration for the Biowatch Technology Enhancements (BTE) requirement on Wednesday November 30, 2016 from 9:00am to 12:00pm Eastern Time. The industry day will be held in the OHA 4th floor conference rooms at 1120 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20005.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The BioWatch Program's critical mission is to operate a nationwide, aerosol detection system providing early warning across all levels of government to support public health and emergency management communities to prepare for and respond to a biological incident. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) conducted a Request for Information (RFI) in FY15 to understand the state of the commercial market for Biological Monitoring, Collection, Identification and Characterization/Survey capabilities. Based on the responses received and an independent assessment of the market's potential, DHS is initiating the BioWatch Technology Enhancement effort to satisfy documented needs for the BioWatch program. The enhanced capabilities would improve the overall BioWatch system's ability to monitor, collect, identify, characterize and/ or survey biothreat agents of public health concern in designated jurisdictions in the United States.</p>
<p>DHS is inviting industry to participate in a Technology Demonstration expected to commence no later than early summer of 2016. The department is seeking to evaluate only mature technologies, those that are at least TRL-6 (demonstrated in an operational or relevant operational environment), against select technical parameters. The information from this activity will inform the acquisition strategy for potential follow-on phases of the Technology Enhancements effort. The information may also be used to support the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for soliciting proposals to technically and operationally demonstrate, procure, and deploy enhancements. Additionally, the type of data sets produced from the Technology Demonstration may be required to be provided by offerors as part of a future Technology Enhancements proposal to demonstrate design and system maturity. Additional information regarding these data sets is forthcoming in a future FedBizOpps announcement. Potential offerors for a Technology Enhancements requirement would be able to utilize independent 3rd party test data comparable to these data sets if they are not participants in the Technology Demonstration.</p>
<p>A Special Notice is anticipated to be issued in late winter or early spring of 2017 to request applications for Technology Demonstration participants. <br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY GOALS:<br /><br />&bull; Present an overview of the BioWatch Program<br />&bull; Describe the goals of the acquisition<br />&bull; Ensure that industry is aware of the Technology Demonstration<br />&bull; Describe the Technology Demonstration objectives and approach<br />&bull; Communicate initial requirements and timelines for Technology Demonstration participation<br />&bull; Understand industry's initial questions and concerns<br />&bull; Understand if a minimum set of robust technologies would be available for the Technology Demonstration</p>
<p>The Government may elect to post to FedBizOpps the industry day sign in sheet including company name and email and/or telephone contact information in order to facilitate information exchange between potential offerors.</p>
<p>Prospective participants planning to attend the industry day should Register here by providing your company name and contact information for each attendee. Please note: due to potential space constraints, each participating company is limited to no more than two (2) representatives. Industry Representatives should enter at the main entrance on Vermont Avenue with a photo ID and be prepared to pass through building security and metal detectors</p>
<p>(Arrival POC: CAPT Malcolm Johns).</p>
<p>Other Details:</p>

<DESC>BREAKOUT ASSEMBLY-DRILL RIG. Solicitation Number G17PS00040. The contractor will provide a Power Breakout Assembly, a Slip Bowl Assembly, a Kit Slip Assembly, and a 5" Drill Pipe Slip, and all installation for a newly procured USGS owned Schramm T130XD Portable Mounted Drill Rig.  

This procurement is made using the procedures outlined in FAR Parts 12 and 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Schramm Inc. Drilling Rigs, West Chester, PA 19380, for a Power Breakout Assembly, with all accessories, parts, labor and installation. This proposed action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Schramm Inc. is the only potential provider of these products due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and the necessity for the assembly to fit flawlessly and precisely to the USGS owned drill rig.   Installation by any other entity other than the manufacturer will null and void any warranty currently on the unit. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency. 

Point of Contact:  Stewart Evans, Contract Specialist, (916) 278-9334, Fax (916) 278-9339.  Email sevans@usgs.gov.

<DESC>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Provening Ground, MD (ACC-APG) intends to award, on behalf of Program Manager Positioning, Navigation &amp; Timing (PMPNT) a&nbsp;Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) modification to Contract Number W15P7T-14-C-C011 with AASKI Technology Inc., Ocean, NJ; in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.301-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&nbsp; Contract W15P7T-14-C-C011 was awarded as a non-commercial small business set-aside.&nbsp; This modification will extend the period of performance (PoP) of the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance services contract by six (6) months, from 29 January 2017 to 28 July 2017. The PoP extension and&nbsp;ceiling increase are needed to maintain uninterrupted engineering and support services while the Government completes its effort to establish a follow-on, fair opportunity competition with ACC-Warren and System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SOSE&amp;I) in Warren, Michigan which is pojected for award June 2017.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The range of critical services that are currently being provided include Program Management, Engineering, Logistics, and Administration for current User Equipment (UE) and emerging PNT products and technologies at various phases of the Defense Acquisition System (DAS) program lifecycle. Examples are participating in the development of program objectives, requirements analysis, strategies, schedules, program documentation, business case analysis, acquisition planning, policy implementation and achievement of milestone objectives for emerging PNT and augmentation technologies. System Engineering support includes support of concept development, systems design and architecture, modeling and simulation, engineering integration, test and evaluation, hardware and software validation support, host platform integration support, field demonstrations of PNT, and Augmentation products or technologies. Logistics support includes assessment, planning and implementation efforts to ensure supportability through the product lifecycle to include maintenance assessments, Integration Logistics Support (ILS), equipment fielding and distribution, institutional and new equipment training, sustainment engineering, logistics standards, policy and procedures and contract data requirements list (CDRL) review in support of all current products. Administrative support includes program office administrative and operational support, development and maintenance of databases to track PNT requirements, product and customer data, briefings, internal and external reporting and tracking systems, various IPTs and Working Groups, website and knowledge management activities and security activities as required.<br /><br />Due to the nature and extent ( Secret clearances and skillset) of the services provided, and the risk to PM PNT operations if a break in service is realized, any company that is to provide the required services, must have properly trained staff members, with the proper clearances in place, and with the correct skill set ready to begin work on the day of award. The timing of the contract due to the slip in award of the follow-on will not allow any transition period to obtain the proper clearances and skill set, or to hire and train any employees. Full performance work must be able to begin on the day of award. As market research has shown, AASKI has the unique ability to continue the work with the required skill set, without a break in service, and it is the only company that has been shown to be responsive, responsible, and capable.&nbsp; However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation,which shall be considered by the agency.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012 (a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor. (b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns. (c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act. <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means- (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code." "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the SAM database" means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes- (1) Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government; (2) Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and (3) The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office. (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4. (3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM. (c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number- (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company telephone number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) Reserved. (e) Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering. Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC><p>The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) was enacted on December 16, 2014 and established new options for trustees of multiemployer pension plans, which are at risk of failing (in critical or declining status). Specifically, the MPRA allows trustees of at-risk plans to apply to the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) for a temporary or permanent reduction of pension plan benefits. If the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) and the Department of Labor (DOL), determines the application meets the applicable requirements of MPRA, the law requires Treasury to "administer a vote" among all the pension participants and retirees.<br /><br />The Treasury requires technical, operational and logistical support services in connection with administering voting elections pursuant to the above MPRA requirement. Specifically, the Treasury is looking for vendor assistance in distributing ballots and receiving votes via a secure, web-based, interactive voice response (IVR), and paper balloting system to conduct individual plan elections by telephone and internet.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active."</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:  U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20230. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span>:<br /></strong><br />Mr. Gunasekaran Sankar<br />Senior Technical Services Manager<br />Indian Oil Corporation Limited<br />Refineries Headquarters, SCOPE Complex, Core-2,<br />7, Institutional Area, Lodhi Road<br />New Delhi 110003<br />Phone:  +91-11-24360246<br />Mobile No:  +91-8826823012<br />Email: sankarg@indianoil.in<br /><br />
<p>Petroleum Coke Utilization:  The Indian Oil Corporation Limited ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Grantee that will assist the Grantee review options to economically convert refinery byproducts, specifically petroleum coke (petcoke), into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.</p>
<p>Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is India's largest public sector undertaking (PSU) accounting for approximately half of the country's refining capacity. IOCL currently operates nine refineries (Guwahati, Barauni, Koyali (Gujarat), Haldia, Mathura, Panipat, Bongaigaon, Digboi, and Paradip), except Mathura Refinery all other Refineries have coke producing capability. IOCL's coke production will almost double between 2015 and 2018 with the commissioning of two new delayed coker units at the Haldia and Paradip Refineries. At the same time environmental emission standards are becoming more stringent, and given this scenario IOCL will be producing an excess amount of petcoke. Thus both economic considerations and environmental compliance constraints means that IOCL must alleviate its excess petcoke situation starting around 2018.</p>
<p>IOCL requires a detailed feasibility study (FS) to review options to economically convert refinery byproducts into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.  The FS will include an analysis and forecast of the international, regional, and domestic demand for petcoke, a review of applicable regulations that will influence the consumption of petcoke and the implementation of any petcoke-based project in India, as well as a model capable of simulating the technical and economic options that are available to IOCL.  In particular, the company is interested in technologies to convert petcoke into other chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and/or power generation.  Several options are available to IOCL to complete this process, which can be integrated directly into its refinery operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $744,675 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC><strong>Description:</strong><br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Training Aircraft Division, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for one (1) year of Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services to DynCorp International, LLC, 13500 Heritage Parkway, Fort Worth, Texas 76177. Market research was conducted and it has been determined this one-year effort is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The COMBS contract will provide supply chain management services supporting the JPATS fleet of 743 T-6 A/B/D aircraft at 11 locations for one year. The US Air Force (USAF) is designated as lead service for the jointly funded (Air Force, Navy, Army) JPATS program. The JPATS users include USAF Air Education and Training Command (AETC), US Navy (USN) Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA), US Army (USA) Aviation Flight Test Directorate (AFTD). COMBS services include but are not limited to; stock, store, issue, procure/deliver, repair, replenishment and return to service of aircraft material and equipment in support of the users' annual flying hour program. The contractor will also provide required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) serviceability documentation and management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) supplied during the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>DynCorp International provides highly specialized COMBS services in support of three variations of the T-6 aircraft, for USAF, USN, USA, at twelve different military installations. DynCorp International is responsible to issue all common and unique material/equipment for the three T-6 variations, to ensure that there are sufficient mission-capable aircraft to meet customer requirements. As the incumbent contractor, only DynCorp International, LLC can provide the required highly specialized services, on 1 May 2017, at acceptable performance levels without causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. In order to transfer responsibility for COMBS services from the incumbent contractor to a new contractor, an overlapping transition period is necessary to ensure the contractor will meet the agency's requirements when full performance begins. Such a transition period would create a gap in service resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The intent of this follow-on contract is to prevent a break in service while allocating sufficient time to conduct a competitive source selection.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, not a solicitation. Responsible sources, however, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Air Force if received within 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice. Any respondent is to specify in its response whether it is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.</p>
<p>Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Any responses will be considered by this office before a final decision is made to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Nicholas Bisher, at (937) 255-0688 or e-mail: nicholas.bisher@us.af.mil or the Contracting Officer, John Seacrist at 937-656-7203 or e-mail: john.seacrist@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battlefield Airmen Branch (BA) is soliciting information to identify sources to provide Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD), production, and sustainment capabilities for Dismounted VDL systems. The Dismounted VDL program was approved to enhance dismounted system capability and to address loss of spectrum, due to spectrum auction. Bandwidths 1695-1710 and 1755-1780MHz were auctioned in L-Band, and bandwidths 2025-2110MHz were expanded in the lower portion of S-Band.</p>
<p>VDL capability improves Intelligence, Surveillance, &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) essential to close air support, Command &amp; Control (C2), air superiority, target identification, and situational awareness (SA). The Dismounted VDL system's overall concept is to receive, transmit, and display secure and unsecure FMV and annotated images to and from C2 nodes (Dismounted, Mounted, Airborne) via a small, lightweight, ruggedized, and reliable receiver or transceiver. The system will be operator-carried for long durations on limited battery power in a full spectrum of environmental and combat conditions.</p>
<p>Minimum Dismounted VDL Requirements</p>
<p>This system is required to possess Type 1 encryption capability through the use of NSA cryptocore modernization (CCM) and Government approved AES encryption. The Government desires this system to be depot-level repairable. The system must be interoperable with 466ER, Tactical, VNW, FM analog, DDL, STD-CDL and BE-CDL waveforms. The system must support UHF, L-Band, S-Band, C-Band, and KU-Band and support new S-Band frequencies of 2025 to 2110 MHz. The system must be water-resistant and ruggedized. The government anticipates allocating 10 to 15 million dollars to this effort or efforts.</p>
<p>The government is interested in evolutionary increases in capability, as well as reductions in Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). This may culminate in multiple development efforts and contracts; both for an advanced capability device, as well as for a very low SWaP, receive-only device.</p>
<p>1. In addition to meeting the above requirements, provide a technology development roadmap for Dismounted VDL, for receive-only and transceiver systems, for the next 5 years. <br />2. The system requirements for the transceiver may require networking capability in either a mesh or hub-spoke structure.<br />3. Identify other peripherals envisioned to be necessary to utilize your system?<br />4. Identify GPS capability you can provide within the stated timeline?<br />5. Describe the user interface of any proposed system, including the Web-based graphical user interface, if applicable.<br />6. What improvements in SWaP can you achieve in this timeline, and how?</p>
<p>Sustainment</p>
<p>1. Describe your training concept.<br />2. What is the maintenance concept to include software updates?<br />3. What built-in test/diagnostic capabilities do you envision? <br />4. Describe your approach for repair and diagnostic capabilities of the system.</p>
<p>System Quality</p>
<p>1. What mean time between failure (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) have you achieved in previous similar products?</p>
<p>Capabilities Package<br />The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The package shall include the following information and address the questions below:</p>
<p>Company/Institute Name: <br />Address: <br />Point of Contact (to include phone number and email address) : <br />CAGE Code: <br />Web Page URL: <br />Size of business pursuant to NAICS Code Insert 6 digit code and title here, size standard Insert size standard here. Based on the above NAICS Code, state whether your company is:</p>
<p>Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Women-Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Economically Disadvantaged Women-<br />Owned Small Business (Yes/No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />HUBZone Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Service Disabled Veteran Owned<br />Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />8(a) Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />SBA Certification Date: ____________ SBA Graduation Date: ______________</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM.</p>
<p>Is your company domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).</p>
<p>Respondents should also state whether they are interested in being a prime contractor for this requirement or a subcontractor.</p>
<p><br />Responses, communications and additional considerations:</p>
<p>One (1) paper copies should be submitted to the program office as outlined below. Respondents shall limit submissions to 20 pages or less and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail on production and sustainment capabilities. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. <br />Respondents who submit proprietary data shall clearly mark the data with appropriate markings on the cover sheet and on each applicable page. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. A determination not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted. Responses shall be received by 4:00pm (est), on 12 October 2015. Paper/e-mail submittals should be sent to the below contacts within AFLCMC/WISK.

A proposal from a qualified offeror (State Licensing Agency on behalf of a blind vendor), whose evaluated proposal is included in the agency's competitive range determination may be awarded the FFS contract without further consideration of other highly rated proposals. <br />- This notice is not designed to discourage competition; rather, it sets out the priority established by the RSA for proposals received from State Licensing Agencies and their blind vendors."</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to extend the market survey response due date to November 25, 2016.


This is a market survey for the above identified requirements.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for offers.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of meeting the service delivery requirements associated with the Operational Analysis and Reporting System (OARS) program.  The attached Initial Program Requirements Document (iPRD) and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) highlight the current operational concept and functional and performance requirements for OARS.
The FAAâ€™s Safety Management System (SMS) has established the need for improved consistency and accessibility to the data used to identify, analyze, and address safety risks. Additionally, the ATO has identified the need to continue moving towards a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a way to improve its capability to efficiently analyze safety-related information. The Operational Analysis and Reporting System (OARS) will address these concerns. 

In support of the NextGen Implementation Plan and Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), the concept of OARS is the proposed solution for the NextGen Operational Improvement (OI) to analyze, assess, and mitigate NAS-wide safety risks with minimal impact to operations. Safety-related information will be collected, consolidated, shared, analyzed, and viewed in a manner such that all OARS users have a shared and consistent view of the safety of the NAS.

OARS will create a single point to access data and functionality currently provided by the various legacy systems described below.  In addition, OARS will create new functionality, including processed tracks, key performance indicators (KPIs), automatic access to data, querying across the safety domain, trend analysis, integrated system security, and single user logon/access.  OARS will also enable users to create processed tracks.  

OARS Phase 1 will include solution planning, management, engineering, testing, and solution implementation activities and gradual operations and maintenance (O&M) transition.   Subsequent phases (Phases 2 & 3) will introduce new functionality and enhancements to support more reliable and predictive safety analyses, real-time safety services, and modeling of NextGen functionality, as well as expand Phase 1 OARS capability to a wider range of facilities and users.  Program policies, procedures, and governance will be further incorporated into OARS, thus providing a deeper understanding of existing hazards and controls. 



BACKGROUND: 

The Operational Analysis and Reporting System (OARS) Phase 1, formerly known as Safety Analysis System (SAS), is a proposed initiative which will address NextGen operational goals for safety analysis and reporting in order to provide immediate safety information (e.g., hazards, mitigations, performance monitoring), based on current and archived safety data, for a wide range of users which will increase the safety of NAS daily operations.  Safety professionals will use analytical and visualization tools that incorporate standard measures, indices, trends, and thresholds for current issues to improve predictive, near real-time analytic capabilities and provide a deeper understanding of existing hazards and controls.

The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Safety Management System (SMS) is a multidisciplinary, integrated, and closed-loop framework used to help maintain safe and efficient air navigation services and infrastructure. The ATO SMS is comprised of four components: 

1.	Safety Policy: Establishes senior managementâ€™s commitment to continually improve safety; defines the methods, processes, and organizational structure needed to meet safety goals, 
2.	Safety Risk Management (SRM): Determines the need for, and adequacy of, new or revised risk controls based on the assessment of acceptable risk,
3.	Safety Assurance (SA): Evaluates the continued effectiveness of implemented risk control strategies; supports the identification of new hazards, and
4.	Safety Promotion: Includes training, communication, and other actions to create a positive safety culture within all levels of the workforce. 

SMS success is highly dependent on the accurate and timely collection and analysis of safety data in order to make smart, system-level, risk-based improvements.

The ATOâ€™s Safety and Technical Training (AJI) monitors and analyzes the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS) in accordance with the ATO SMS, and leads a broad range of activities, programs, and initiatives that communicate potential improvements. 

The ATO has significantly expanded its capability to detect and record events that may prove hazardous, which necessitates corresponding improvements to support the analysis of the collected data. Two major factors have contributed to this increase in the FAAâ€™s capability: 1) the implementation of a non-punitive voluntary safety reporting program (VSRP) for employees involved in the delivery of air traffic services; and 2) the introduction of tools such as the Traffic Analysis and Review Program (TARP), a system that automatically captures potential losses of separation.  Improvements and additions to the legacy tools and capabilities below are necessary to take full advantage of this additional data, so that richer safety analysis can be provided in an efficient manner.  

The current legacy tools, which are a collection of systems, applications and processes, include the following:

â€¢	Comprehensive Electronic Data Analysis and Reporting (CEDAR)
â€¢	Falcon (Rapid Air Traffic Replay Tool)
â€¢	Traffic Analysis and Review Program (TARP)
â€¢	Airborne Risk Analysis Process (A-RAP)
â€¢	Surface Risk Analysis Process (S-RAP)
â€¢	Surface Integrity Risk Analysis Process (SI-RAP)
â€¢	Safety Application and Analytics (SAT)
â€¢	Aviation Common Taxonomy (ACT)
â€¢	Safety Management and Tracking System (SMTS)
â€¢	Compliance Verification Tool (CVT)
â€¢	Runway Safety Tracking (RST)

These tools were often developed ad hoc, with different languages and protocols, and little documentation, which impact scalability and overall system maintainability.  The functionality of these legacy tools are further detailed in the â€œOARS Scopeâ€ section below. 


OARS SCOPE

Safety analysis and reporting functionality currently is provided by a number of discrete systems.  These systems include the following:

â€¢	Comprehensive Electronic Data Analysis and Reporting (CEDAR) â€“ The CEDAR system provides air traffic management with an electronic means of capturing safety-related information, events, and metrics. It streamlines several facility managersâ€™ responsibilities, including assessing air traffic employee performance and managing resources, and provides a standard interface for the collecting, retrieving, and reporting of data from multiple sources. CEDAR automates the creation, management, and storage of facility activities and events; briefing items; occurrence reports; technical training discussions; and FAA forms such as 3120-25, OJT Instruction/Evaluation Report and 7230-4, Daily Record of Facility Operation.
â€¢	Falcon (Rapid Air Traffic Replay Tool) â€“ Falcon is a software program/tool which can save continuous, periodic, or event-driven recordings pertaining to air traffic operations, voice, radar, and weather. Falcon automates the analysis and review of potential losses of separation between aircraft that occur within ATC facilitiesâ€™ boundaries.
â€¢	Traffic Analysis and Review Program (TARP) â€“ TARP is a software application that provides near real-time review and replay of NOP recorded data to detect losses of separation in accordance with FAA Order 7110.65.  By September 2012, TARP configurations had been implemented for all terminal radar facilities. Since then, the FAA has expanded TARP to include the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). TARP uses NOP data from all TRACONs and ARTCCs as the source for surveillance data, which now account for 205 TARP configurations.
â€¢	Airborne Risk Analysis Process (A-RAP), Surface (S-RAP), Service Integrity (SI-RAP) â€“ A risk-based approach to address losses of separation, RAP consists of a panel of at least two controllers and a pilot. Three panels, one in each ATO Service Area, review separation losses for events in which pilots maintain less than 66% of required separation. SRAP is a process used to assess the risk of collision in selected surface events and executed as part of the ATO Quality Assurance Program. SIRAP is a process used to assess the risk of technical occurrences where the ability to provide safe Air Traffic Management (ATM) services is compromised.
â€¢	Safety Applications and Analytics (SAT) â€“ SAT consolidates data and analytics in one location, providing AJI staff with a single point of access for its data needs. The system is based on a hierarchical view of AJI analysts. It encompasses services ranging from filtered data extraction to dashboarding to automated detection methods.
â€¢	Aviation Common Taxonomy (ACT) â€“ The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) Common Taxonomy Team develops common taxonomies and definitions for aviation accident and incident reporting systems. Common taxonomies and definitions establish a standard industry language, improving the quality of information and communication, and greatly enhancing the aviation community's capacity to focus on common safety issues.
â€¢	Safety Management Tracking System (SMTS) â€“ The ATO's SMTS is an automated system used to track the status of SRM assessments and tracking plans. The data stored in this system is also used to track mitigations. SMTS replaces the old Hazard Tracking System (HTS). All SRM assessments are required to be entered into the ATO's SMTS.
â€¢	Compliance Verification Tool (CVT) â€“  A national database that contains information related to the compliance verification process. Information includes checklists, reports, facility information, tracking information, response data, and other statistical information available on the Compliance Verification Tool website. Information contained in reports, mitigation plans, status reports, and closure is submitted through this database system.
â€¢	Runway Safety Tracking System/Runway Safety Tool (RSTS/RST) â€“  The Runway Safety Tool (RST) is a web based application that allows for the automation of the data collection process for any given surface event in order to accelerate the time spent by the Office of Runway Safety to retrieve data and accurately analyze the event. The RST provides a single means of data storage/access as it pertains to any singular event (i.e. Runway Incursion, Surface Incident, Runway Confusion, or Runway Excursion). The tool automatically pulls data at least once every 24 hours from numerous databases, including but not limited to CEDAR and ATQA.  The RSTS tracks the proposed actions to address hazards associated with the most serious runway incursions.

These legacy safety systems are not enabled to automatically share data between one another, resulting in inefficiencies and duplication of effort.  The legacy tools were developed independently of each other, without attention to scalability, configuration management, or consistent documentation standards.  For instance, the various legacy systems are each accessed via the FAA Portal with separate links and logons.  This inhibits the effectiveness and efficiency of the safety management process.  




MARKET SURVEY DETAILS

<p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The discovery and development of an AIDS vaccine remains among the highest research priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and is a principal mission of NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS). To support this mission, NIAID has provided high-quality, novel, and targeted reagents, assays and services for investigators engaged in AIDS vaccine-related research, including NIAID-funded grantees and contractors, other NIH-funded researchers, and investigators supported through various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These services are provided through this contract by investigator request and NIAID staff approval. The current contract for this work is entitled " Reagent Resource Support Program for AIDS Vaccine Development" and the incumbent contractor is Quality Biological Inc., contract number HHSN272201100023C.</p>
<p>Description <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to produce, procure, store, ship, and maintain an up-to-date inventory of high-quality reagents and assays in support of preclinical and clinical AIDS vaccine research.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: 1) procure, purify, and test reagents, including, for example: viral proteins and peptides, virus stocks, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, vaccine vectors, vaccine adjuvants and cytokines, and any additional reagents deemed necessary for the NIAID DAIDS Vaccine Research Program; 2) perform genetic cloning and sequencing; 3) acquire the needed reagents, assays, and/or services used to evaluate AIDS vaccine safety and immunogenicity; 4) analyze all reagents for purity and integrity, and provide for their quality control and assurance; and 5) provide for receipt and inventory tracking, storage, maintenance, and distribution of all reagents.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about January 7, 2018. The requirement will be for the delivery of 2.00 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the above functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, Options for additional level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work. These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Option 1 - 6: Extend the Term of the Contract: The Government may exercise options to extend the term of the contract beyond the Base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years of the performance. The total period of performance resulting from the base period plus all potential Term Options is 7 years. Assume that the scope and types of activities as outlined for the Base Period (Year 1 of the contract) would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period.</p>
<p>Options 7-20 Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Up to Two (2) Options per year may be exercised during years 1 through 7 of contract performance. Should the Government elect to exercise these Options, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.0 FTE for each option exercised. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the base year or the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;responsible small business&nbsp;offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about November 29, 2016, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: NEXRAD Radar DC Servo Motors
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 335312, Motor and Generator Manufacturing. The small-business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing new DC Servo-motors to be used in the NEXRAD WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System that is a form, fit, function, replacement of the legacy DC Servo Motor, and is compatible with the existing servo amplifier and servo choke.</p>
<p>NEXRAD (Next-Generation Weather Radar) is a network of 168 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). NEXRAD detects weather events and is the primary detection system used by the NWS to support issuance of severe weather warnings, and used by the FAA and USAF to support safety of flight operations. The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) is responsible for complete life-cycle support of the radar network including system engineering, configuration management, and logistics analysis and support.</p>
<p>Each servo-motor is interchangeable between axis (Azimuth and Elevation) and shall be designed to accommodate this function and shall be in-field serviceable. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution, as there are known sources of motors in the marketplace which meet all requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting all requirements of the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), any product proposed to support this requirement shall not have proprietary limitations that restrict the future repair of the motor to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of manufacturing and delivering up to 500 DC Servo Motors, P/N 2200220-201 or equivalent. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was Electo-Mechanical Systems.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the DC Servo Motor are documented in the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), number 2200220-201. There are 3 sources for the DC Servo Motor documented in the VID as "suggested sources". These suggested sources have previously provided motors for test and evaluation for use in the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar that have demonstrated their ability to be compliant with all requirements. Any product that is proposed shall meet all requirements of the VID without significant modification. If a commercial product, other than those listed in the VID, meets all requirements, a sample will be requested to support Government inspection and testing in order to validate suitability of the product.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: NEXRAD Radar DC Servo Motors
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 335312, Motor and Generator Manufacturing. The small-business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing new DC Servo-motors to be used in the NEXRAD WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System that is a form, fit, function, replacement of the legacy DC Servo Motor, and is compatible with the existing servo amplifier and servo choke.</p>
<p>NEXRAD (Next-Generation Weather Radar) is a network of 168 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). NEXRAD detects weather events and is the primary detection system used by the NWS to support issuance of severe weather warnings, and used by the FAA and USAF to support safety of flight operations. The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) is responsible for complete life-cycle support of the radar network including system engineering, configuration management, and logistics analysis and support.</p>
<p>Each servo-motor is interchangeable between axis (Azimuth and Elevation) and shall be designed to accommodate this function and shall be in-field serviceable. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution, as there are known sources of motors in the marketplace which meet all requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting all requirements of the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), any product proposed to support this requirement shall not have proprietary limitations that restrict the future repair of the motor to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of manufacturing and delivering up to 500 DC Servo Motors, P/N 2200220-201 or equivalent. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was Electo-Mechanical Systems.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the DC Servo Motor are documented in the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), number 2200220-201. There are 3 sources for the DC Servo Motor documented in the VID as "suggested sources". These suggested sources have previously provided motors for test and evaluation for use in the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar that have demonstrated their ability to be compliant with all requirements. Any product that is proposed shall meet all requirements of the VID without significant modification. If a commercial product, other than those listed in the VID, meets all requirements, a sample will be requested to support Government inspection and testing in order to validate suitability of the product.</p>
<p>All dates listed below are tentative dates. Official dates will be provided when the solicitation is released.</p>
<p>TENTATIVE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: November 10, 2016</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Stratus Systems, Inc.; is the only company that can properly modify the proprietary system and maintain the warranty. The AAV EELS will be modified to accept and condition AAV vehicle power. The AAV EELS will utilize the AAV vehicle as the primary power source to reduce the Total Ownership Cost (TOC). The AAV EELS contains proprietary electronic assemblies for which Stratus Systems, Inc.; is the sole manufacturer. The AAV EELS is also subject to a 5 year warranty which is still in effect for fielded assets; AAV EELS is still in production. To properly address potential issues with the proprietary electronics, and to prevent voiding the warranty, it is imperative that the AAV EELS be modified by Stratus Systems, Inc. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery will be F.O.B.

<DESC>The Philadelphia District intends to initiate a Request For Proposals and award one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite, Quantity (IDIQ), Single-Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) to provide remediation of the Formerly Utilized Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site at the former DuPont Chambers Works Site (DuPont FUSRAP site) in Deepwater, New Jersey. The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government intends to award using the Best Value Tradeoff Process to one responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government.<br />There will be a pre-proposal site visit to allow prospective offerors access to the site. The date and time will be listed in the solicitation document posted to FBO.gov; offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed during this one escorted site visit the Government will host. Note: The solicitation and subsequent contract will include FAR 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work. All interested offerors will be expected to contact Steve Creighton via email at Stephen.J.Creighton@usace.army.mil within 5 calendar days after the solicitation has been posted. Each offeror will be restricted to two attendees; provide the following information in the email: name, company name, email, and phone number.<br />This requirement is to provide remediation services at the DuPont FUSRAP site. The remediation services include the removal of radioactively contaminated soil and ancillary groundwater from Areas of Concern (AOCs) at the DuPont FUSRAP site. The bulk of the soil volume is mixed waste which includes FUSRAP-related waste and non-FUSRAP chemicals mixed with the FUSRAP waste. Certain non-FUSRAP chemical waste require appropriate handling and health and safety measures during the excavation. <br />Also, included is removal of all FUSRAP related debris and hazardous material which may contain above and below ground utilities. Existing utilities must be protected and if necessary may be replaced which could include water, sanitary line, steam conveyance piping and possibly other Chemours utilities. Work will include treating some contaminated groundwater with the Construction Water Treatment Plant (CWTP), transportation and disposal of waste, and soil and groundwater sampling. Additionally, site restoration activities will be required including backfilling, regrading and possibly paving portions of the site. Lastly, the Contractor shall be responsible for dismantling and demobilization of the CWTP.<br />This acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a single responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the terms and conditions of the solicitation represents the overall best value to the Government after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation without discussions. The offeror's initial proposal should therefore contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.<br />Proposals will be evaluated against the following factors and sub factors (listed in descending order of importance) as listed in the solicitation Factor I - Technical Approach, subfactor 1 - Corporate Experience, Subfactor 2 - Organization Approach/Management Plan/Quality Assurance Approach, Subfactor 3 - Project Completion Approach and Safety, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Construction, and Factor 3 - Price. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than Price; however, Price will remain a significant factor and will increase in significance in the selection decision the closer two proposals are in rating and ranking.<br />This SATOC contract is set-aside for small business program participants. The estimated amount of the contract is $75 million. The solicitation number for this procurement is W912BU-17-R-0002. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 562910 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The contract shall be issued for a five (5) year ordering period. The Government intends to award one IDIQ SATOC contract.<br />The solicitation will be issued on or about December 5, 2016, with a proposal due date of about January 6, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Davis Bacon rates will be applicable to any Construction Task Orders issued under this contract and Performance and Payment bonds will be required for Firm Fixed Priced Construction Task Orders. Service Contract Act rates will be applicable any Service Task Order issued under this Contract.

<DESC><p>16 Nov 16:&nbsp; The&nbsp;proposal due date&nbsp;has been extended to 9 Dec 2016.///kam<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a pre-solicitation notice for an acquisition to proceed as a 100% set aside for small business concerns. The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.</p>
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, SFC Kenetta Meares, by e-mail Kenetta.a.meares@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p>The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 25 March 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS</p>

<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued.

<DESC>This is a modification to the pre-solicitation notice posted on 7 October 2016.
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare housekeeping and related services in support of multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the health service area (HSA) of Bassett Army Community Hospital (BACH), Fort Wainwright, AK. This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type I. II, III, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on an MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award. The resultant FFO task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe BACH MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be FFP and subject to the Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. 351). The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line item numbers (CLINs) with 5-year ordering periods. The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for the post award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against fiscal year (FY) 17 funds.

The system must retrieve additional relevant related data and build a robust notification that delivers needed information to the appropriate staff device or display.  The system must work with data from the disparate systems.  This Facilities and Clinical Alarm, Alert, and Notification Event Management system will recognize information is only as relevant as the context within which it is delivered and create context-aware notifications.  The system will manage alarms generated by nurse call, patient monitoring, STAT order, BMS, Telemetry, Code, EMS and Accutech Patient wandering system.

<p>Contractor Awarded Name:<br />Vascumab, LLC<br />Contractor Awarded DUNS: <br />07965309</p>
<p>Contractor Awarded Address:<br />23 Business Park Drive<br />Branford, CT 06405</p>
<p>Description:<br />Vascumab will deliver a selective orally active HDAC4/5 inhibitor clinical candidate for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This project will cover the work necessary to deliver an intermediate objective: a selective inhibitor at lead development that is effective in the SU-5416/hypoxia and monocrotaline rat models of PAH have acceptable pharmacokinetics and is safe in a rat exploratory toxicological study. PAH is a progressive fatal disease caused in part by aberrant proliferation of pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which leads to high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which leads to high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and the right side of the heart leading eventually to right sided heart failure.</p>
