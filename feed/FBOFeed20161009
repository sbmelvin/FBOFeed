<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a need for streaming technology to provide remote captioning. We contract with or have cadre Computer Aided Real-time Translation services to comply with the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Act for ensuring accessible communication during events and meetings where FEMA is participating. Remote captioning services are required to provide access to disaster information according to Federal laws and regulations including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 including 504 and 508 as Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II. <br />Sec. 689e of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), signed into law on October 4, 2006, amends the Stafford Act to require FEMA to work with state and local governments to identify population groups with limited English proficiency and consider them when planning for emergencies or major disasters. Furthermore, Sec. 689e of the Post-Katrina Reform Act requires FEMA to ensure that information for all individuals affected by emergencies and major disasters are available in formats that can be understood by persons with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs.
<p>FEMA is firmly committed to ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities and those with access and function needs throughout our programs and services. Through inclusive community-wide planning initiatives and emergency management practices, we maximize our resources, meet our obligations and strengthen our ability to meet the needs of the whole community before, during and after disasters. Interpreter services are required for survivors who are Deaf or hard of hearing to have access to FEMA programs, services and information.<br /><br />FEMA is requesting that vendors provide their capability statements to meet this need.</p>
