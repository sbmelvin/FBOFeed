 I. SCOPE OF WORK

A. Introduction

Since independence in 1964, Zambia has struggled to stay on a steady, broad-
based path of economic, political and social development.   Zambia faces 
daunting challenges as a transformational development country.   Some 78% of 
its people live below the poverty line with little access to basic health and
education services.  The HIV/AIDS pandemic takes its toll on all aspects of 
Zambia’s social, political and economic structures.  Economic growth has lagged 
behind population growth and basic needs.  

Zambia’s key political issues are constitutional reform (including electoral reform), combating corruption (grand and petty), and decentralization. Many Zambians perceive the present constitution to be a constraint, in particular in its broad authorities vested in a Presidency with few “checks and balances”.  Civil society is likely to make this a major issue during the 2006 election campaign.  Parliament struggles to assert itself following decades of subjugation to the executive branch.  A poorly funded judiciary seeks to strengthen the independence and efficiency of the legal system.  Weak accountability and financial integrity in public office and the civil service in general exacerbates corruption.  The lack of effective and inclusive local governance impedes Zambia’s democratization and broad-based economic growth.  

Zambia’s narrow economic base constrains its development.  Historically, the economy depended on copper exports, concentrated ownership of assets, limited foreign and domestic investment, with widespread corruption.  Zambia’s key macroeconomic challenges include sustaining economic growth; reducing inflation and interest rates; stabilizing the exchange rate; improving the weak balance of payments position; reducing the budget deficit; and addressing the debt burden.  Constraints in its key agricultural sector include high transport costs; weak market infrastructure; uneven production and inconsistent quality; lack of market access information, inputs and credit; and cyclical drought.  As Zambia’s long-term growth is tied to an export-led strategy, addressing these key constraints is fundamental.  Some regions of Zambia are prone to food shortages due to a preference for water-intensive maize, monoculture cropping, and the abandonment of drought resistant millet.  

Within the education sector, HIV/AIDS has created an acute shortage of teachers, resulting in the progressive deterioration of pupil/teacher ratios and persistent classroom overcrowding.  The narrow gender gap at the time of Grade 1 admissions widens in favor of boys in the upper primary grades.  

A host of global health issues led by HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria hinder Zambia’s development.  HIV/AIDS is destroying families, institutions, and the country’s ability to achieve sustainable development.  Challenges associated with HIV/AIDS include: 1) loss of economically active adults in their prime earning years, including the loss of well-trained people encumbering top positions; 2) increased number of orphans – some 1.1 million in Zambia, of which an estimated 750,000 orphans lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS; and 3) increased costs of treating the ill and the dying, further straining the GRZ’s health system and draining any family savings.  Malaria represents the second greatest challenge to Zambia’s health after HIV/AIDS.  The incidence of malaria has tripled in the last 20 years and is the leading cause of death for children under age 5.  Other concerns include high rates of maternal and infant mortality and falling rates for fully immunized children.

Despite the overwhelming challenges, there are some promising signs.  The 
GRZ is taking positive – albeit deliberate - steps to fight corruption at all levels.  A 
variety of positive factors have converged to promote a more robust economy.  
Specifically, the mining industry is enjoying the benefits of high copper prices.  
Small businesses and the agri-business sectors are showing continuing signs of
 development and expansion.  Successful privatization has paved the way for 
much of this recent improvement.  During 2005, Zambia secured debt 
forgiveness under Highly Indebted Poor Country criteria by pursing ambitious 
monetary and fiscal policies that have reduced government debt levels and
stabilized inflation to below 20%.  These factors all bode well for the future of 
Zambia.  All of these factors have led to a recent and precipitous climb in the 
value of the Kwacha against major world currencies, including the dollar.  Such appreciation over the long run may significantly adversely affect the competitiveness of the export sector in the Zambian economy.  This calls for 
careful monetary management by the GRZ. 

The U.S. is well-positioned to support Zambia’s aspirations to tackle the significant development that it faces.  USAID/Zambia has designed programs that address these challenges and support U.S. strategic and foreign policy priorities and interests.   The newly designed MCA Threshold Program complements and leverages these existing programs in economic growth and democracy and governance.  
 
B.	MCA, Economic Growth and Anti-Corruption Program Overview 

The governments of Zambia and the United States are in the process of finalizing a Threshold Country Plan (TCP) for Zambia under the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).   This two-year program of activities will facilitate Zambia’s entry in the group of nations eligible to receive full MCA Compact Country funding.  Approval of the TCP is expected early in 2006.

In May of 2005 the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) approved the Zambian Concept Paper for the MCA Threshold Program.  The Concept Paper outlined three areas of concentration: 

•	Petty corruption and administrative barriers to economic growth
•	Private sector development, including the establishment of the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA)
•	Trade facilitation with a focus on streamlining border procedures

The submitted TCP maintains the tight focus on the three areas outlined above and approved by the MCC in the original concept paper.  Given its short time horizon (2 years), the program recommends targeting a limited number of pilot activities that can have a definitive, but effective impact within the life of the program.  These include such activities as streamlining land titling and registration processes (a source of considerable and high-profile corruption), introducing new technologies and procedures for registering new businesses, and modernizing border management at two key transportation nodes (a second area rife with corruption).  

The MCA Threshold Program will be a high-profile and intense activity.  Success will be measured within a limited duration of 24 months.  

Presently, the Zambia MCA Threshold Program is under review by the MCC.  This position is contingent upon approval of the program as proposed by the government of Zambia.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for Strategically Hardened Facility Defeat (SHFD).  The DARPA SHFD program seeks to develop non-nuclear earth-penetrating systems for the defeat of hard and deeply buried targets with major strategic capabilities.  The Government requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www1.fbo.gov/ and www.fedgrants.gov/Index.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA06-16) on or before 4:00 pm, 7 April 2006, local Arlington, VA time. 

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA; the Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Management Approach; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (d) Relevant Experience in Developing Military Systems; and (e) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

 
A TOP SECRET facility clearance AND a TOP SECRET safeguarding clearance is required to perform under this BAA.  Organizations that do not have BOTH of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does. 

For additional details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria for the SHFD program, reference the classified Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP). To receive the classified PIP, your organization's CAGE code must list both the facility and safeguarding clearances, as a minimum, at the SECRET level.  Proposers are advised to email their Facility Security Officers (FSO) name, phone number, secure fax number, classified registry mailing address, and CAGE code to Ernest.Fields.ctr@darpa.mil as soon as possible in order to receive the classified PIP in time to prepare their proposal accordingly.  The PIP will be sent ONLY to each organization's FSO.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for fishery observer services. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples. Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation. This data is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying trained NEFSC certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  NEFSC will train the contractor’s observers once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Government’s expense.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports.  The Government estimates 12,000 sea days per year.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  The contract award date is anticipated to be October 1, 2005 with a period of performance of five (5) years thereafter.

In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.  Facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests will not be honored.

<DESC>A critical component of the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) nuclear countermeasures architecture is a passive gamma and neutron radiation detection portal (termed the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal) suitable for examining cargo containers, trucks, personally owned vehicles, mail and bundled cargo.  The Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) system will use the full gamma radiation spectrum and total neutron count rate from the inspected material to make a detection and identification decision.  The gamma radiation detectors in the ASP system utilize thallium enhanced sodium iodide (NaI) crystals to absorb the gamma radiation, and with the assistance of the electronics, the device records the energy of the gamma radiation.  Since each isotope in nature gives off a unique energy pattern, the collected data is used to evaluate whether the radiating material is a threat to the public or benign.   

To obtain contractors to produce and supply these gamma radiation detectors, DNDO plans to conduct a full and open competition, with the selected firms being awarded production contracts.  Attached to this announcement are draft documents representing the current planned solicitation and specifications to meet the program requirements for these detectors.  It is requested that interested potential sources review the attached documents and provide questions/comments.  The Government may publish responses to applicable questions/comments on these documents with the final solicitation.   

Note that this is not a formal request for proposal.  There are currently no funds available for this project and the Government will not make award or develop a source list based on responses to this Request for Information (RFI).  DHS will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this RFI.

Sources are encouraged to review the draft documents and provide comments and recommendations for addition, change, or deletion.  It is the Respondent’s responsibility to periodically review either of these websites for notices, amendments, updates, questions and answers and changes to the posted information.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for 2 EA. Ambient Temperature Actuators (ATA), 3 EA. Helium Cryogenic Actuators (HCA), and 1 EA Documentation Package. NASA/GSFC intends to award a sole-source contract to CDA Intercorp of Deerfield, FL pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. They are the only developer that possesses the necessary combination and configuration of certified cryogenic brushless DC motors, cryogenic gear heads and couplings, cryogenic field directors, and cryogenic resolvers for the assembly of a complete actuator that is certified to perform at cryogenic temperatures with a manufacturer's warranty of up to 5 years.  The afore mentioned components must all be integrated into a common housing for each actuator unit and must possess a 20:1 gear pass, a resolver coupled to the output of the gear head by a gear ratio of 2.75:1, and fully redundant motor coils, resolver, and field directors.  The ATA units must be lubricated in wet lube and the HCA units must be lubricated in dry lube.  HCA units must be able to survive and perform within the specified parameters, listed in the attached SOW and specifications, at cryogenic temperatures of &lt; 40 Kelvin for a mission life of 5 – 10 years.   The delivery timing is critical for the integration of the actuator units into the Micro-Shutter Assembly of the NIRSpec micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) on schedule.  CDA Intercorp is the only developer that can provide and fully warranty each assembled actuator unit and its components to the required specifications and deliver all five (5) assembled actuator units within 20-26 weeks after contract award.  Procurement of individual components from alternative sources will require subsequent engineering, fabrication, and assembly to configure the actuators for integration into the Microshutter System,  CDA’s unique combination of qualifications allows for the delivery of fully assembled actuator systems ready for integration into our device.  Receiving fully engineered and assembled actuator units from one source increases reliability, reduces cost, maintains clear warranty responsibility, and provides for the delivery of the required units in the shortest time scale to meet the ambitious schedule of the Microshutter Project.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 22 and 26. Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities no later than 4:30pm EST Friday, February 24, 2006, the end date of publication of this synopsis, to the NASA/GSFC Office and contact listed above. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement to obtain back-up quasi-cw (QCW) laser diode arrays for the Flight Model (FM) of the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) laser. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the secondary source laser diode arrays from Nuvonyx in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.   The LOLA Instrument is an instrument selected for inclusion on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).	The reliability of the laser diode pump arrays is a key factor to the success of the LOLA Instrument.  The laser diode arrays fabricated by Nuvonyx have been space-qualified by the European Space Agency (ESA) and are slated for space launch for ESA on ALADIN mission.	Other than LOLA’s primary source arrays, the Nuvonyx arrays are the only arrays to have undergone a full battery of space qualification tests and meet the LOLA lifetime requirements of 1 billion shots.  The secondary source status of the Nuvonyx devices is due to the fact that they have not yet been demonstrated in space flight, but are form and fit replaceable with LOLA’s primary diode arrays.  The combination of having passed rigorous space qualification protocols and credibility is a sufficient justification for sole source acquisition of the secondary arrays from Nuvonyx, Inc. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 02/27/2006.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement to obtain primary quasi-cw (QCW) laser diode arrays for the Flight Model (FM) of the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) laser. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the primary source laser diode arrays from Coherent Laser Group in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The LOLA Instrument is an instrument selected for inclusion on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).	The reliability of the laser diode pump arrays is a key factor to the success of the LOLA Instrument.  The laser diode arrays fabricated by Coherent Laser Group are of an identical type to those used on the Mercury Laser Altimeter, which have been shown to satisfy the LOLA requirement is terms of lifetime (&gt;20,000 hrs) and reliability (MTBF&gt;38,000 hrs).  It is essential to procure the QCW arrays from Coherent Laser Group because of the flight heritage of the Coherent devices and the extended lifetest performed on these devices after the launch of the Mercury Laser Altimeter instrument.  The Coherent laser diode arrays are fabricated from aluminum-free epitaxial wafer material, which is known to be more robust than the competing Aluminun-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) technology.  The Coherent Laser Group arrays are based on gallium indium arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) wafer material and hence have compatibility with our electronics, in terms of compliance voltage and series resistance. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 02/27/2006.

<DESC>NOTICE: THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE ORDER FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESCRIBED BELOW.  ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN BELOW, BEFORE FEBRUARY 17, 2006.


STATEMENT OF WORK 
 Distance Learning Sustainment


DATE: 02 DEC 05
1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1 	  Organization.

1.1.1 Identification.  United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training (DCSOPS&T), ATTN: ATTG-CF, Training Development and Delivery Directorate (TDADD), Distributed Learning Division (DLD), Bldg 161, Room 108, Fort Monroe, Virginia 23651-5000.

1.1.2 Mission.  Modernize outdated schoolhouse resident classrooms across Army installations to provide schoolhouse instructors with a digital platform to conduct training; provide the infrastructure to deliver digital training from the schoolhouse to remote Digital Training Facilities and Reserve Components; and provide soldiers with 24/7 reach back capability for training access anytime/anywhere.

1.2 	  Background and Objective.

1.2.1	 Background.  This effort supports the TRADOC Army School Classroom Modernization Program, Classroom XXI (CRXXI).

1.2.1.1.   TRADOC is the proponent for courses teaching technical and tactical proficiency, military occupational specialty (MOS) qualification and reclassification training, leader development, and functional skill development.  The resident training infrastructure consists of hundreds of classrooms built over the last 50 years.  Current classrooms lack the information technology to support delivery of digital web-based training.  

1.2.1.2.	CRXXI is the advanced instructional technology environment in which the soldier in the Legacy Force and the Transformation Force will train.  This TRADOC initiative modernizes the institutional training classroom with information age technology to gain training efficiencies, while maximizing solder training effectiveness.  Modernization requires investment in hardware, software, facilities, and communications.  CRXXI provides a training infrastructure of interoperable, electronically linked classrooms that are conducive to student learning while enhancing the student’s ability to see, hear, and participate in the learning experience.  The CRXXI solution consists of:

Classrooms.  CRXXI Program modernizes TRADOC resident training classrooms to transmit and deliver digital training “anytime, anywhere” from Army proponent schoolhouses with reach back capability from barracks, homes and digital training facilities.  This program transforms current instructor-centric, self-contained classrooms into student-centric, multimedia platforms with worldwide capabilities for students to obtain and share training material and collaborate with other students.  Classroom XXI establishes both the architectural criteria for classroom rehabilitation and the technology standards for Army schoolhouse training, using open architecture and standards-compliant technologies for interoperability

Digital Training Access Centers (DTAC).  The DTAC is a central network room connecting the classrooms.  The DTAC electronically stores and distributes the digital proponent record copy of approved training materials.  Instructors and students will access training materials through the DTAC.  The programmed 15 DTACs fielded by FY02 require sustainment.

1.2.2 Objective.  Sustain the technological training environment by modernizing institutional training classrooms.  The Service program includes ongoing engineering. The contractor shall integrate, procure, stage, install, test and provide technical assistance to fielded Army installations.  Fielding and sustainment includes all equipment, hardware, software required to produce a high technology environment with video tele-training (VTT) capabilities in a rehabilitated classroom.  

1.3 Technology Environment. The CRXXI is a turnkey solution.   The contractor shall engineer, integrate, procure, stage, install, test, and sustain fielded facilities.  The technology solution is  part of the classroom modernization program.

1.3.1.2 Classrooms.  The TRADOC CRXXI Master Plan identifies 5 levels of classrooms based on training capabilities.  The SOW only considers Levels 1 and 3.  The Level 1 instructor presentation system supports training delivered using instructor-led discussion techniques, allowing the instructor the capability to access training material from a centralized storage facility, the DTAC, to lead the students through the training process from an Instructor Computer Workstation.  The Level 3 classroom includes an individual computer for each student, two-way audio, an instructor management system, and a local area network (LAN) connected to the installation network.  The Level 3 classroom also features video teletraining (VTT) equipment to support the delivery of instructor-based synchronous distance learning.  Types of equipment that will provide these capabilities are as follows:  Audiovisual presentation system with projectors, video screens, audio system, audiovisual controller, etc; student management system controller; student management student station; VTT platform; streaming video to desktop; network connectivity and licensing; and installation and integration for turnkey solution.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate with Raytheon Company, 2501 W University Drive, McKinney, TX, 75071 on an other than full and open basis to increase the level of effort on contract N00173-04-C-2008. The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contract, awarded to Raytheon Company, 2501 W University Drive, McKinney, TX, 75071, on April 29, 2004, on a sole source basis, will continue the identical support adding approximately 100,000 hours, estimated to be $30M for an additional five years. The contract provides technical support for developing and demonstrating an Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) mode for Navy radar. The support continues the experimental programs, installation/reinstallation of the system, field engineering support, data collection, modifications of radar system software, firmware, and other hardware to implement demonstration modes and functions of the system. Additionally, this support will continue the performance studies to define future modes and functions of the system. This modification continues the third of three phases constructing Fleet Demonstrations Units for fleet evaluation. Raytheon Company has unique capabilities to support the effort required by this modification to the contract. Raytheon Company designed and fabricated the ARPDD system with associated technical data being proprietary. This continuing support consists of several equipment assemblies and massive software that includes technology for fully automatic periscope detection and discrimination. This constitutes one of a kind technology development items by Raytheon Company. Only Raytheon Company personnel have the knowledge and experience necessary to install, operate, maintain, and make necessary modifications to the ARPDD hardware and software. In order for other contractors to support the required field testing and data collection, a major training program for another contractor’s personnel would be required. The GFE one box Receiver Exciter Synchronizer (RES3) that is an integral component of the ARPDD radar system is a one of a kind unit constructed by Raytheon Company. Only Raytheon Company personnel have the knowledge necessary to integrate this equipment for special test and data collection functions. Technical data packages that would allow another contractor to bid and manufacture the APS-137, which forms the backbone of the ARPDD an Advanced profile Systems, have not been obtained by the development agency. Full data packages for the brassboard ARPDD and associated systems is not practical at this time due to continued revisions in order to test multiple functions and technical approaches. For another contractor to come up to speed on the system designs and functionality would not only be time consuming but also cost prohibitive. Award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the Implementation Phase of the Solar Imaging Suite (SIS) instruments that are to fly on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) R series of weather satellites. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Lockheed Martin, Advanced Technology Center (LMATC) Palo Alto, CA.	LMATC is the only known source because they were the only source to respond to NASA's request for proposal for the Formulation Phase of this requirement, and received award for that phase.  To be considered a viable source for Implementation of the SIS instruments, a non-Formulation contractor must demonstrate that it has a comparable level of instrument design maturity and provide the equivalent of  the Final Report to the cognizant NASA/GSFC technical office.  To date, no contractor, other than LMATC, has contacted the Government to engage it in the same reviews of its progress to assess compliance with the requirements.  The DRAFT Performance Operations Requirements Document for the Implementation Phase is attached for any other vendors that would like to be considered as a viable source.  To be considered, vendors MUST contact the Contracting Officer, Donna L. Santos (301)286-4013, Donna.L.Santos@nasa.gov, immediately, or NO LATER THAN February 24, 2006. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>99--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-0001 Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) for Metallic Materials
<SOLNBR>4586
<RESPDATE>033106
<CONTACT>Dy Le, 609-485-4636
<DESC>This BAA has been edited to change the following under section (7): Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of $300,000 in any fiscal year. ****************************************************************************** Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-0001 Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) For Metallic Materials 1. Background The FAA is currently considering the damage tolerance requirement for rotorcraft structures and dynamic components.  While the damage tolerance methodology has been extensively and successfully used in fix-wing aircraft structures, rotorcraft has just begun to use it in addition to the safe-life approach.  Generally, safe-life, in flight hours, is experimentally determined using the mission profile, flight loads, and S-N data.  Using Miner's cumulative fatigue damage rule, a fatigue damage rate for each flight condition is typically calculated by assessing the damaging load cycles per hour from the flight spectrum and loads data, the ratio of the alternating load to the endurance limit, and the cycles-to-failure from a standard component S-N curve.  A reciprocal summation of each fatigue damage rate for each flight condition then determines the retirement life of the part being analyzed. In contrast to safe-life, the damage tolerance (DT) approach assumes that an inherent flaw or crack exists in the manufactured part.  The life of the part is determined using fracture mechanics methodologies, load spectrum, manufacturing process and operating environment.  Based on the computed crack growth life of the inherent flaw or crack, suitable inspection intervals are established so that cracks can be found and repaired long before they achieve a critical length.  The effectiveness of the damage tolerance approach depends on several factors that include fatigue crack growth data, initial crack sizes, fracture mechanics and computational methods, effects of shot-peening and cold working, and inspection techniques. The success of implementing the damage tolerance approach to fixed-wing aircraft structures, coupled with the FAA's goal to enhance aircraft safety has lead to RCDT research and development (R&D) efforts for rotorcraft.  In 2005, the FAA assessed the current state of RCDT and fracture mechanics technologies.  During the assessment, the FAA asked the rotorcraft community for their inputs on fracture mechanics and RCDT-related technologies.  The FAA then conducted the gap analysis to identify research needs for supporting FAA rulemaking.  Identified RCDT research tasks were then prioritized using the FAA prioritization process and criteria.  Finally, a roadmap for RCDT was developed to guide the research to support FAA rulemaking and the implementation of RCDT requirement.    2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct the RCDT research to support FAA rulemaking.  Particularly, this effort shall support FAR 29.571, 27.571, AC 29-2A, AC 27-1A, AC-29-2C, FAA Order 8110.9 which can be downloaded using the following link:  http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements) and 5 (Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements).  Technical summary proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2006 (FY-06) funding for the RCDT effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as they can before FY-06 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) working days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email only.  4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two-page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two-page technical summaries to: FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480, Building 300 (Attn: D. Le) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having a security protection. Thirty (30) working days or earlier, after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission of a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the items presented in the selected two-page technical summary.  Additionally, the formal technical proposal shall address all or some of the research requirements described in section 6 of this announcement, Formal Proposal Requirements.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word shall be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having a security protection. The FAA shall receive both versions of the formal technical proposals according to the submission deadlines required in section 3. Formal proposals shall not exceed 50 pages. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two-page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	Affiliation, contact or principal investigator name, phone, and mailing and email addresses. b.	The specific purpose/objective of the proposed research applicable to FAA rulemaking on RCDT. c.	Description of the research approach. d.	Description of research outputs and how they will be incorporated in RCDT regulations.  e.	Description of the metrics used to measure research performance. f.

<DESC>This modification to the previous announcement changes the dates as indicated in this revised announcement (only the dates are changed).  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for fishery observer services. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples. Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation. This data is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying trained NEFSC certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  NEFSC will train the contractor’s observers once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Government’s expense.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports.  The Government estimates 12,000 sea days per year.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  The contract award date is anticipated to be November 1, 2005 with a period of performance of five (5) years thereafter.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about August 1, 2005 through the Government’s website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The estimated due date for proposals is September 15, 2005.  A preproposal conference and site visit, if determined to be necessary, will be conducted at NEFSC Woods Hole, MA on or about August  18, 2005.  The basis for proposal evaluation will include, in descending order of importance:  Technical Requirements, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Key Personnel, and technical, when combined, is significantly more important than price.  This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6 million.  This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation.  Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps register to receive notification feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation.  Each potential offeror is responsible for checking this website to gain all the updates/amendments to any and all documents.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be address to Lynne.B.Phipps@noaa.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>This procurement (N44255-04-R-9102) is being issued UNRESTRICTED under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236210.  The corresponding SBA size standard is $28.5 Million.  The estimated cost range for this solicitation is over $100,000,000.  This procurement will result in a firm fixed price contract.  

Only U.S. citizens may participate in this solicitation and resultant contract.

Full plans and specifications will not be available until approximately May 2006.

This project will construct an 180,000-ft2 multi-level (approximately 270 ft by 360 ft), below-grade, earth covered, internal and external blast hardened, heavily reinforced concrete structure.  Special features of the facility include:  Two tunnels (approximately 400 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 16 ft tall) to provide heavy vehicle access to and from the below-grade levels; above ground mechanical and production support buildings; power-operated physical security and blast-resistant doors; (7) overhead bridge cranes (2 ton capacity), (3) elevators, lightning protection system, grounding system, emergency air purge system, and multiple independent HVAC systems (approximately 11).  This project will also provide a new observation tower, utilities, and other site improvements.  The existing perimeter fence, and roads will be expanded to encompass the new facility.  The anticipated contract duration is approximately 1235 calendar days.  The exact duration will be stipulated in the solicitation.  

The Navy intends to issue the construction solicitation in two parts:

Part I consisted of Prequalifying of Sources in accordance with DFARS 236.272.  The purpose of Prequalifying firms is to develop a list of Qualified Firms who possess the proven competence to perform the construction of MCON P-973.  No pricing will be requested during prequalifications however firms must demonstrate the capability of bonding over $100,000,000.  Only firms who participate in the Prequalification of Sources and are determined to possess the necessary competencies will be able to participate in Part II, the Construction Request for Proposals (RFP).

Prequalification is anticipated to be completed in February to March of 2006.

Once the prequalification procedures are conducted, qualified Prime Construction Contractors will be posted to the Navy’ s www.esol.navfac.navy.mil website for subcontracting opportunities.  All prime contractors/subcontractors/suppliers are advised to register and periodically review www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for any changes/additions.  
Estimated closing date for receipt of prequalification submissions occurred in September 2005.  

Part II will consist of Source Selection (negotiated) best value procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  Only those firms found to possess the necessary competencies as stipulated in the Prequalification will participate in Part II, the Construction RFP.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.    

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  OFFERORS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Anticipated construction contract award is September 2006.

Full plans and specifications will be issued only during Part II, Construction RFP.    Subcontractors/Suppliers shall be notified of plans and specifications availability via ESOL only.  It is each firm’s responsibility to periodically check www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for the specific date that plans and specification shall be made available.  It is anticipated that offerors shall be charged for plans and specifications.

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Office of Inspector General (OIG) plans to contract for actuarial support services in connection with its audit of the RRB’s FY 2006 financial statements.

The RRB’s financial statements are audited annually pursuant to the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002.  Effective with FY 2006 financial reporting, the statement of social insurance, previously presented as supplementary information, will become a basic financial statement subject to the auditor’s opinion.  As part of the audit, the OIG must evaluate the statement of social insurance for conformance with applicable guidance and determine whether the estimates contained therein are fairly presented in all material respects.  The statement of social insurance is prepared by the RRB’s Bureau of the Actuary at the agency’s headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.  The successful offeror will assist the OIG by performing tests of the work of the RRB’s actuary that are required to support the OIG’s opinion on the statement.

General Information about the RRB, its mission and statistical information, including the most recent actuarial valuation of program assets and liabilities is available at the RRB’s public website, WWW.RRB.GOV.  The statement of social insurance is prepared pursuant to the requirements of Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) #17, #25, #26 and #28 as issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) which are available at WWW.FASAB.GOV.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued a Statement of Position, 04-01, “Auditing the Statement of Social Insurance,” dated November 22, 2004, which is available from that organization.

The solicitation document will be available about January 12, 2006, and will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (Fed Biz Ops) website: WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV.

Note (1) - The NASA environment has vibration characteristics of approximately 3.2 g, 200 Hz -10,000 Hz.	It has peak sound pressure levels of 141 dBA.  NASA will have the responsibility for damping of vibration loads exceeding 1g. NASA will have the responsibility of damping acoustic loads by no more than 6 dB.	However, the Vendor shall provide acoustic and vibration information for each proposed product where that data already exists or a rough estimate if these data do not exist.  Note (2) – NASA intends to perform most maintenance and diagnostic/repair with NASA engineers and technicians. Therefore, NASA will require a list of vendor-specified LRUs (Least Replaceable Units) and part numbers to be provided with delivery of the imager. Prices are not required for the LRU Parts List. In order for these technicians to perform maintenance and diagnostic/repair, NASA will require a set of instructions in an Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M). A maintenance, installation, and operation manual shall be provided with delivery of the imager.  Both a hard copy and soft copy of such documentation shall be in industry standard formats (MS Word, Open Office, PDF, or similar format) on CDs or DVDs.  The assumed expertise of the user is to be at an experienced microwave engineer level, thereby eliminating lengthy and detailed explanations.   Note (3) – Training and Acceptance testing will be conducted at the vendor’s facility for three to four people. Acceptance testing is defined as a test to verify that the performance of the imager meets the contracted specifications.	 No solicitation currently exists. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SEEKING SYNOPSIS AND NOTFICATION OF INDUSTRY DAY ONLY.The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.     This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.     The intent of this INDUSTRY DAY [16th March 2006 at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) facility Edwards AFB, CA] is to obtain market research on the details for the Draft BAA announcement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. Information will be released in sections.     Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.The Air Force is initiating major efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies that will lead to the transition of the new technologies into propulsion systems for operationally responsive space lift system. AFRL planning has identified that new technologies are required to develop a highly operable rocket engines. Identification and demonstration of these technologies is critical to retire the risk for high performance, highly operable rocket engines.  The goal is to develop and test a technology test bed for a booster-class, hydrocarbon fueled engine that is highly operable while traceable to Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) Phase II goals. The program goal will be to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the engine via component and integrated system testing thorough a TRL 5 technology demonstrator engine. The technology development efforts to be conducted by any contract awarded through the eventual BAA will be conducted under the guidance of the IHPRPT program. Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that a prospective offeror have either a government coordinated Advance Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP), or develop an ARPP prior to or in conjunction with proposal submittal, or have a documented working relationship with a company possessing a government coordinated ARPP to ensure IHPRPT relevance of any proposed technology.  In addition, as part of ensuring IHPRPT relevance, the offerors will be expected to define quantitatively the proportion of the overall IHPRPT goals each component technology will contribute (i.e. the technology objective), how these individual contributions or objectives “roll-up” to assure the achievement of the overall goal, and identify the means by which achievement of the objectives will be measured. Information regarding the IHPRPT programs in general and the ARPP process is available at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards AFB, CA. Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this INDUSTRY DAY should contact Steve Hanna at stephen.hanna@edwards.af.mil .     Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors need attend.  Interested contractors may request an informal meeting to discuss these requirements. If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your visit request to Mr. Stephen Hanna (661-275-6021) prior to your visit. Discussion topics may include: 1) clarity and content of topic description, 2) clarity and relevance of evaluation criteria, 3) amount and distribution of funding, 4) period of performance5) proposal guidance and 6) proposal timeline.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is considering replacement of our Xerox 4890 printer and is seeking information on new technology which will meet our printing requirements.  Our requirements are:  Printer must support a monthly workload which varies from a low of 50,000 pages to a high of 240,000 with a mean just below 100,000. The largest single monthly print job is 17,000 pages. The current printer does this job in 3 ½ hours (about 90 ppm). This print job cannot take longer than an 8-hour shift.  Print quality must support scannible bar codes (300dpi or better). One color (in addition to black) is used to separate instructions from the reporter’s response from last month. The print operator needs to be able to start, stop, and restart print jobs as well as control priorities and print order.

The printer must have network connectivity. BLS uses an Ethernet network and runs Windows 2003 servers. The printer must have the ability to disable any unnecessary services, including FTP, SNMP, HTTP, TELNET, and IPP.   Not having this ability will disqualify a proposed print solution.

The survey supported by this printer is under severe scheduling constrains. If the printer stops for any reason, on site technical support is required within 2 hours, five days a week. The schedule for the big print jobs is known in advance so preventative or preparation maintenance can be accomplished. If the replacement printer requires more than 6 hours for the largest print job, quicker maintenance response may be required.

The printer is in a raised floor, HVAC and humidity controlled environment. Power is available in 110 or 220 as required by the replacement printer.

Companies who can meet our requirements should submit specifications and brochures to:     
         Bureau of Labor Statistics
         ATTN:  Judith Silver, Room 1830
         2 Massachusetts Ave, N.E.
         Washington, DC 20212

Commercial price lists would also be welcome. All information must be submitted NLT February 24, 2006.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, ONLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Once the final requirement is established a Request for Proposal will be issued.

<DESC>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking sources to perform procured medical administrative support services in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically-dispersed Air Force bases in the Continental United States and at many overseas bases.  The work may augment medical support services provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees or other contract staff or could provide new capability to the MTFs.  However, the Government may opt to contract an entire service or operational activity within an MTF.   In this case, the purpose, scope, objectives and constraints will be provided to the contractor for the service under consideration in the form of a Statement of Objectives.   

Medical Administrative Support Services can be any occupation that engages in activities that support the operations of the medical facility.  Preliminary considerations are focusing the acquisition on a broad spectrum of occupations.  These staff members serve the MTF in administrative or informational processes that do not involve direct medical treatment or intervention.  These may include:  appointing, coding, medical records, transcription, medical education, patient administration (admissions/dispositions) and other medical administration positions supporting MTF missions and program management.  Medical Administrative Support Services does not include nutritional medicine (food service), medical equipment repair, housekeeping, information systems, or facility maintenance.

Background:  Currently, these medical administrative support services are procured when needed by each MTF using a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts for similar personnel.  The mission of the AFMSCC is to develop a strategic purchasing plan for the Air Force’s future medical administrative support service requirements that is efficient and effective.  The goal is to leverage resources, define common specifications and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments.  Because the AFMSCC just began development of the acquisition strategy, the number, scope and geographic coverage of each contract, the types of contract, and acquisition methodology has not been determined at this time.  The AFMSCC seeks to minimize impacts to existing small business contractors.  We are seeking large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that small businesses can “bring to the table” for anticipated medical administrative support services requirements worldwide (outlined in the attached Labor Category table).  A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds NAICS 561110 (Office Administrative Services), and 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) both have a size standard of $6.5M (3-year average annual receipts); however, they are not necessarily medical in performance.  621999 (All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Service) has a size standard of $9M.  We are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection as well.  

What the AFMSCC needs:  If you are an interested large or small business, please respond to the survey questions at the following link:  http://www.mcix.com/Surveys/TakeSurvey.asp?SurveyID=6ML9m3K08o20I
The survey can take 15-25 minutes depending upon the type of services offered by your company.  However, your willingness to provide the details requested will be invaluable to the Government’s during this planning phase.  Notice:  The AFMSCC has non-Government employees (i.e., contractor employees) assisting with market research.  These non-Government employees, who have all signed non-disclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  Submitting your answers in the survey link above is the Government’s preferred data collection method.  Please complete the survey by 2 March 2006.

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Armyâ€™s Program Manager for Close Combat Systems, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806  is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to test,  and deliver M81 Igniters, Time Blasting Fuse with shock tube capability.. Due  to the continuing war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Marine Corps has a need  for increased quantities of the M81 Igniter due to elevated usage. An estimated  quantity of 850,000 M81 Igniters is required. Monthly  Deliveries of 70,000  will begin August 2006.  A description of the M81 is as follows: The M81 Igniter, Time Blasting Fuse with Shock Tube capability, NSN 1375-01-442- 0939, Part Number 12972620. The M81 is a hand held pull type Igniter to  initiate modernized demolition items (MDI) and M700 Time Blasting Fuses. It can  be utilized in all weather conditions. The MDI is a family of non-electric  initiating systems, which uses Shock Tube technology to transmit the initiating  signal to the explosives or demolition devices. The Shock Tube consists of a  small diameter plastic tube of extruded polymer with a very fine layer of  energetic material deposited on the inner wall. The Shock Tube is non- fragmenting and noiseless.  Interested parties who believe they can fulfill the Governmentâ€™s requirements  by starting deliveries in August 2006 should respond to the undersigned stating  their capabilities, any current Government contracts which they might have that  would allow them to begin deliveries within the next 6 months and/or their  plans for how deliveries could be made within the required timeframe to meet  the Governmentâ€™s requirements. As the existing contract with Mast Technologies is a total small business set-aside, only responses from other certified small  business concerns will be considered.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this  survey. Interested parties that believe that they can meet the requirements  above are requested to provide a capability statement which incorporates the  capacity for manufacturing production quantities including company name,  address, telephone number, and technical point of contact  by 24 February 2006  to the US Army TACOM/ARDEC, ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APA, Stephanie Resch, Building 10,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000,email responses may be sent to  sresch@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>Innovative Payload Development for Non-Lethal 0.68 caliber, pneumatically launched projectiles Background:  The Armament Research Development and Engineering Center at  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking sources for the research & development of  highly innovative payloads and/or projectiles for non-lethal applications for  use in 0.68 (in) caliber pneumatic launchers. Performance Parameters of interest include: Total Projectile (with payload) Mass:  approximately 8-9 grams Muzzle Velocity:  approximately 300 feet/sec. Interior Ballistics:  The projectile & its payload should be sufficiently  hardened to withstand the acceleration forces from being launched from a  compressed air pneumatic source.  Projectile bodies should be rifled for spin- stabilization from a smooth .68 caliber barrel and compatible with current  commercial-off-the-shelf feed systems. Exterior Ballistics:  The new designâ€™s effective range should be nominally  equal to or better than to existing products, without any increase to injury  potential at point blank ranges. Terminal Effects:  The projectile/payload should be capable of  delivering a  robust target effect from ranges 5 meters to 100+ meters without causing a high  risk of injury. Other:  Features and/or design elements that the offeror recognizes as factors  that may reduce the overall development risk/cost/time of developing a  militarized product are encouraged to be included in any response. Innovation:  Contractors are strongly encouraged to be innovative in their  solutions, both for projectile design, and also for the projectileâ€™s payload.   Potential non-lethal applications vary, and payloads can include but are not  limited to: marking, tagging, blunt trauma, light/sound, electrical stun,  and/or combined effects.  These innovative concepts may also include non-lethal  anti-material and/or non-lethal anti-personnel solutions.  Interested offerors  may offer a projectile, a payload and/or both. Interested offerors should submit information as to their qualifications and  plans for executing this program within 30 days to: Commander, US Army TACOM- ARDEC, Acquisition Center, AMSTA-AQ-APB, BLDG. 9, ATTN:  Ms. Morgan Ross,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.  All information is to be submitted at no  cost or obligation to the Government.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES OF EMAILS WILL BE  ACCEPTED.  This is sources sought notice only.  It is for planning purposes  only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal.

The crest width will be 15 feet with a front and back slope of 1 vertical on 1.5 horizontal.  Armor stone thickness will be 10 feet with core layer thickness depen dent upon existing ground elevation.  A 30-foot wide scour apron will be constructed over the toe of the extension on the inside (north side) of the jetty and will vary in thickness depending upon bottom elevation, top elevation will be set at -4 feet, MLW .  Both extension and scour apron will rest on a 2-foot thick layer of bedding stone that will be placed over non-woven geotextile filter fabric.  The base of the structure will be at elevation -10 feet, MLW, or on existing bottom, whichever is deeper.  Am our stone size will range from 7 to 12.5 tons and will have a density of 165 pounds per cubic foot.  Core stone will range from 500 to 2,500 pounds and will have a density of 165 pounds per cubic foot.  The bedding stone will have a density of 140 pounds p er cubic foot.  Total quantities of materials required for construction of the structure are approximately:  32,800 tons of amour stone, 13,000 tones of core stone, 10,500 tons of bedding stone, and 11,800 square yards of filter fabric.  The Option Bid Ite ms consists of constructing a concrete walkway over approximately 650 feet of the existing south jetty and over approximately 550 feet of the new 1,000-foot jetty extension.  Total quantities of materials required for construction of the walkway are approx imately:  1,300 tons of core stone, 100 tons of chinking stone, 160 cubic yards of non-reinforced concrete, 110 cubic yards of reinforced concrete, and 2,850 linear feet of aluminum handrails.

The overall goal of the PHACS initiative is to address continuing critical research questions on the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to antiretroviral (ARV) chemotherapy in a representative cohort of HIV-exposed, uninfected children from the United States (U.S.) and the clinical course of perinatally-acquired HIV infection in adolescents. The initiative involves two prospective observational studies. The first is called Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities Study (SMARTT Study). It is designed to assess the long term safety of fetal and neonatal exposure to prophylactic antiretroviral chemotherapy, as recommended by current U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines. The second is called the Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP). It is designed to assess the effects of perinatally acquired HIV infection in adolescents. 

The HSPH intends to award subcontracts during the Summer of 2006 to support domestic sites to conduct the SMARTT and AMP protocols. The earliest award date is expected to be on or about August 1, 2006. The complete RFP contains detailed information on preparing the technical and cost proposals, the evaluation criteria, and additional background information.  

Interested parties are invited to request the complete RFP by sending an email request to the party named below. The proposal due date is April 10, 2006, 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time).  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria by an Ad hoc Peer Review group.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Sole Source to Accusoft
<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office intends to issue an order to B&L Associates for other than full and open competition. The order issued will provide for licensing and software support of the BL/LIB, BL/LIB ROBO and BL/DIST software products for 2006.     This non-competitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 6.301.     Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     The PTO has been using the BL/LIB and BL/LIB ROBO products since 1996 and the BL/DIST product since 1991.     As is common for software products that run on the Unisys platform, only one company is in the business of supporting this proprietary software.     That company is the creator of these products, B&L Associates.     Therefore, this order can only be placed with one source:     B&L Associates.     A recompetition of the product and support at this time would add unnecessary expense and time delay to the USPTO.

<SUBJECT>A -- Laboratory Radiation Simulator Development Testbed Support
<DESC>This is a sole source procurement to increase the contract ceiling to an existing contract with Titan Pulse Science Division (dba L-3 Communications Titan Corporation, Pulse Sciences).  The increase in the ceiling is $8.5 million from the current ceiling of $35 million to a new ceiling of $43.5 million.  The scope of work of this Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract (#DTRA01-02-D-0005) is to provide a broad range of recurring requirements for scientific, technical, application engineering and scientific services, technical support, analysis services, facility engineering and technology and supplies. The major purposes of the contract are to procure specialized expertise and services essential for performing system development and engineering qualifications tests, survivability demonstrations, modeling and validation and certification requirements analysis and pulsed power experiments. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) terawatt-class radiation simulators are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are customized to provide the test environments needed by the Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) communities.  The raise in ceiling is needed because of an unexpected amount of customer testing and additional tasks placed on the contract in support of simulator development above estimated operation and maintenance costs.  There has been an average increase of 31%/year of external test customer support and $1.8M above average cost per year for maintenance and repair.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

Section C - Descriptions and Specifications 

NAVAL HOSPITAL CAMP LEJEUNE (NHCL) PAGER REQUIREMENTS AND STATEMENT OF WORK

This contract shall provide for the lease of 365 numeric/alpha numeric (one way) pagers, including airtime and maintenance with the following minimum salient characteristics:  
•	same area code and prefix on all pagers 
•	numeric pagers should be standard seven digit sequencing (xxx-xxxx, approved numbering by Government)
•	all pagers must be black in color
•	operation with one (1) AAA or AA battery
•	minimum 20 message slots
•	backlight display
•	message time-stamping
•	numeric retrieval 
•	alpha numeric (one way) retrieval
•	audible tone and silent vibration features
•	date/time of day display
•	custom greeting for alpha numeric pagers
•	message lock (10 message slots)
•	memory retention; (when the pager is turned off, all pages with time of day remain in memory.)
•	memory retention (when battery dies pages stay in memory)
•	memory full display (when 40 messages are stored in memory, a memory full notice is displayed).  
•	memory full - new message causes the oldest (first) read message to be overwritten.  (when read messages are erased, the display returns to the standby screen
•	duplicate message display
•	battery low notification both audible and displayed
•	retrieval time for pages should be no more than 20 seconds 

All pagers provided shall be new or in as-new operating condition, meeting or exceeding the minimum salient characteristics specified above.   

All pricing will be based on a “per pager, per month” cost.  The government will at no time be required to purchase any hardware, software or equipment to support the paging system, as the contractor will provide all this. 

Any pager, any part of a pager, or pager case that becomes damaged or nonfunctional due to normal day-to-day use and subjected to normal wear will be repaired or replaced at no cost to the government in less than a 48-hour period of time.  A local representative will be required to pick up broken pagers and drop off spare pagers on an as needed basis, not to exceed 3 times per week, defined as Monday through Friday (excluding Federal Holidays.)

The contractor will replace a minimum of 20, lost, stolen, or water damaged pagers per each contract performance period which includes the base plus each option year, at no charge to the government.  Replacement of lost pagers in excess of the minimum proposed per contract performance year shall be negotiated prior to delivery of the pagers and paid by the Government under a separate contractual document issued by NHCL.
  
The contractor will provide an Integrated Computer System in the NHCL Communications Center that centralizes all paging throughout the Command, so that all outgoing pages originate from the NHCL Communications Center.  The Integrated System needs to be compatible with NHCL’s current network which is a Windows XP.  The system needs to be able to quickly access all pager numbers and/or names by the NHCL Communications Staff, and provide the staff the ability to send text pages from the desktop without the need to dial a phone. In addition, the system needs to enable NHCL to create an unlimited number of paging groups, so that one common page can be sent simultaneously to multiple pagers.  Due to limited space restraints in the Communications Center, use of flat screen monitors and space saving built-in PCs would be optimal.  

 The Integrated System may include but is not limited to the following components at no additional cost to the government:

•	SNPP and SMTP continuous connection to the contractor’s paging server, without any interruptions.
•	All required PC components (mice, keyboards, etc.) to run the paging system, utilizing as little space as possible, with network connections to the NHCL network.
•	Laser printer connected to the NHCL network.
•	Centralized paging software licensed and maintained by the contractor.
•	Full functioning paging transmitter onsite, maintained, serviced, and installed by the contractor.
•	All PC software to include Microsoft Word, Excel, and Network versions.
•	E-mail addresses to each pager.
•	Full e-mail and text paging support of NHCL owned Blackberries and personal wireless devices.
•	365 extensions to pagers (each pager will have one) dialed through one phone number, and also having 800# to those extensions to be used as a backup in the event of an emergency.
•	Contractor must be able to replace any or all on site communications equipment owned by the contractor within 24 hours but no later than 48 hours in the event of a massive failure.
•	Contractor will respond by phone, to any emergency call related to the paging service no later than one (1) hour after receipt of notification from Government, and be on site for repair or service restoration within 12 hours including holidays, weekends, and after-hours in the event of a massive failure.

All inter-related systems such as billing and inventory maintenance shall be real-time.  All changes will simultaneously update Government and Contractor web based records.  

The contract coverage area of the required paging services shall cover at a minimum, the entire states of North Carolina and Virginia.

The contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) at least five (5) business days in advance of any scheduled system downtime.  As follow up, the contractor shall provide a written explanation.  

The contractor shall notify the COR immediately after the onset of unscheduled downtime or outages.  As follow up the contractor shall provide a written explanation.  

The contractor shall meet the minimum performance standards as stated below:

•	No more than 1% of active pagers will be inadvertently disconnected due to vendor error per month.
•	No more than 1% of active pagers will receive garbled messages per month.
•	No more than 1% of active pager custodians submit a Quality Assurance Complaint confirming risk of patient safety per month.
•	No more than 1% error rate in daily activations, removals and swaps.

The contractor shall guarantee 99% system availability of its core paging transmitters on a monthly basis.   

The contractor shall submit a monthly pager usage report to the COR no later than the tenth calendar day of the following month.  The report shall list, in numerical order the following:

•	all pagers in use under contract

•	the number of calls made to each individual pager for that month


Monthly pager invoice needs to be submitted hard copy that is prepared by Vendor on letterhead.  Bill should reflect all active pagers with current monthly charges.  

Delivery of the required numerical/alpha numeric pagers, replacement belt clips, and replacement battery covers shall be made, FOB Destination.  The contractor shall deliver pagers and have all communications equipment installed 15 calendar days prior to the activation date to Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune; Attn: Operating Management Department, NH-100 Brewster Blvd. Camp Lejeune, NC 28547.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  However, this procurement is unrestricted and any interested contractors may submit a quote. 

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Trace Explosive & Narcotic Detector to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

***Background

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive and narcotic detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation and ion mobility spectrometers for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to conduct research on the performance capabilities of emerging trace detection systems being deployed to rapidly scan people and other items passing through security screening checkpoints for the presence of explosives or narcotics. Trace detection systems rely on the removal, collection and preconcentration of particles that are collected from a surface by swipe sampling. The swipe is inserted into the detector where the sample residues are thermally desorbed for detection by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of detector systems are being developed. For this purpose, NIST has several trace explosive/narcotics detectors that represent current technology. A new technology is emerging that utilizes two IMS detectors in one system. This allows simultaneous analysis of explosives and narcotics while optimizing the temperatures in each tube.*** 
 
***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  Line Item 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Trace Explosive & Narcotic Detector.

***The device shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:

1.  The detection system(s) must be based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).
2.  The system must be capable of simultaneous detection of both positive and negative ions which allows for detection of both explosives and narcotics within the analysis time specified below.
3.  The system must allow different temperatures to be set for positive ion analysis and negative ion analysis.
4.  The following analytes must be detectable: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), nitroglycerin (NG), cocaine, heroin, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and methamphetamine.  
5.  Sampling and analysis time must be less than 20 seconds per sample. 
6.  Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection (see note 1)) to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below).
7.  The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.
8.  The system must be a desktop or hand-held instrument.

*** Installation/Training/Warranty

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and one (1) training session for five (5) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation/set-up and demonstration of performance specifications (as described below), but shall be completed no later than 30 days after delivery.
2.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone support for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.***


*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications as follows:  Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes (deposited as solutions onto the primary collection grid) at twice the LOD or LOD90 as specified by the supplier. This level for each analyte will be the “detector challenge” (DC)(see note 2).  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and will be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses.  The instrument must demonstrate the required 20 second throughput requirement during all normal analyses.***

**Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

Note 1 -- The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal. In IMS, background variations are very much smaller than the measurement repeatability (standard deviations) of reference samples, so samples at strictly defined LODs would exhibit a false negative rate of about 50 percent (assuming that the alarm thresholds were set at the LODs). To define an LOD where a positive alarm would be expected reliably (over 90 percent of the time), we must factor in the measurement variability. We define this value (LOD90) as the amount of substance that generates a mean signal three times greater than the standard deviation (s) of the individual measurements. The conversion from measurement units (a.u.) to amount of substance (mass) is via the slope of the sensitivity curve (S). We also assume that the mass of analyte in the blank is zero.

LOD90 = 3 • s • S, where S = delta (mass)/delta (a.u.)

Note 2 -- The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the LOD90, so that,

DC = 2 LOD90

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The purpose of this modification is to answer offeror questions.  
Question 1:   For the seventeen (17) SuperServers do you want Part #6014H-82B?  Response 1: Yes, the correct part number is 6014H-82B.   A typo was made in the original announcement. Please revise part number 6104H-82B to 6014H-82B.  Question 2:  How many hard drives are needed per server for the 17 servers, one hard drive or max load of 4?  Response 2: One (1) drive per unit is needed.  Question 3:  I have the same question for the three (3) SuperServers 6034H-X8R, one hard drive or max load eight?  Response 3: One (1) drive per unit is needed.  Question 4:  There is no O/S listed, is this correct, or does NUWC plan on using other means of acquiring and installing an O/S (i.e. ESI), or performing this function themselves?  Response 4:  No OS required.  Question 5:  The hard drive requirement is listed, but does not state the number of drives requested.  Does this imply that only one drive is needed per Chassis?  (Chassis 6014H-82B supports up to 4 drives & Chassis 6034H-X8R supports up to 8 drives).  Response 5:  One (1) drive per unit required.  Question 6:  Part# 6014H-82B is a black chassis, while part# 6034H-X8R is beige.  Both models are available in either beige or black at no additional cost.  Is there a preference, or is the current list correct (Black for the 1U servers and Beige for the 3U servers)?  Response 6: All units should be black.  Question 7:  For the memory on each system there are 8 slots available.  Each slot is capable of supporting up to 4gb per slot, but each system only supports up to 16GB of memory.  NUWC has requested that the total amount of memory be 8GB, but does not state what size each chip should be.  I recommend using 4 x 2GB chips (installed in pairs) so that you still have 4 free slots on each chassis to allow for expansion in the future.  That being said, what size chips is NUWC requesting?   Response 7:  We require 8-1Gb cards for a total of 8Gb.  Question 8:   Does NUWC require a RAID controller for Data redundancy (as each chassis will support but is not included)?  If so, is there a particular RAID controller that NUWC requires, or will the contractor be required to quote the best price technically acceptable?  Response 8:  Raid controller not required.  Question 9:   Does the Optical Drive have to be a SCSI one [Optical Drive- DVD RW/CD Combo (Slim) (Must be SCSI)]? I could not find any SCSI slim DVDRW. Typically we use NEC IDE DVDRW.  The specifications call for the optical drive to be "DVD-RW/CD combo (slim) (must be SCSI)".  This is an unusual request as these are normally an IDE interface.  We don't know of any source for SCSI slim line DVD-RW/CD. Is this correct?  The specification for the SCSI Slim DVD-RW/CD drive is impossible to meet.  These items do not exist.  Slim DVD-RW/CD drives exist, however they are all IDE/ATA interfaces.  Supermicro system by default supports the IDE/ATA interface, not SCSI for this particular drive bay.  Can you please indicate how this portion of the specification should be addressed?  Response 10:  An IDE/ATA Slim DVD-RW will suffice.  Question 10:  1GB DDR2 PC3200 memory comes in two different types. One is single rank and one dual rank. Single rank memories are pretty expensive (around $70) more than the dual rank.  Supermicro recommends that for a configuration above 6GB in a system, we have to use single rank memory. (The system will work with dual rank but eventually you will get into problems).  Response 10:  The single rank memory is required.  Question 11:  The 2 systems you have specified in this RFQ do not support Dual Core CPUs.  They do however offer Dual Core Xeons but not in these models as these use the 64 bit Xeon 2M Cache.  I have been informed that the SuperMicro servers and boards requested do not support dual-core processors.  They do support 64-bit Xeons, but not the dual core version. Can you let me know what direction to go in here?  Would the users like these servers with the 64-bit Xeon processors, or do they require the dual cores?  If they require the dual cores, that will require a different server set-up, with a different board.
Response 11: Dual Core is not required.  The 64 bit Xeon 2M Cache chips will suffice and we will need two CPU's per unit at 3.6 GHz.
