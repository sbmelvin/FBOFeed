As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.   Quotes are due by close of business 04/16/04 at the SW Idaho/Nevada Acquisition Office, 1249 S. Vinnell Way, Ste 200, Boise, Idaho 83709.  FAX quotes will be accepted at 208-373-4197.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service/GovWorks, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Eric B. Landis, Stillwater, MN.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Contract in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Geological Survey.  The USGS has a requirement for the acquisition to provide for a pilot research project to investigate and document best practices enabling Metadata Development in Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sciences.  The objectives of this project are to: 1. Review and document current metadata practices across multiple aspects of existing information management programs. 2. Develop and disseminate best policies and practices for improving the frequency, quality, utility and distribution of metadata for biological and ecological datasets, and 3. To Facilitate the use of national data and information clearinghouses for archiving and distributing metadata.  The estimated total value of this project is $33,000.  Eric B. Landis brings this project to the FGDC based on observations and comments from metadata training that he has performed for other organizations.  His established network spans Federal, state, local, and tribal governments.  Because of his long involvement with these groups, Mr. Landis has established a level of trust that allows him to network freely and receive comments on personal, internal, cultural, and bureaucratic obstacles in implementing metadata as a process in GIS and other geographic-base data activities. Eric B. Landis is the only vendor with the extensive established network necessary to complete this project. Eric B. Landis is recognized in the geospatial community and will be able to utilize his reputable trust and reliability so that these communities will confidently and confidentially relay the cultural, bureaucratic, and other roadblocks to the creation of metadata. No other vendors have the capability to acquire the extensive network that Eric B. Landis currently possesses. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST March 21, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.

<RESPDATE>040204
<ARCHDATE>05022004
<CONTACT>Connie Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking information about the availability of a single cell battery tester for discharging and recharging 2 Volt batteries.  This tester will be used for the 24,768 batteries associated with the 129 operational UPMs (Uninterruptible Power Module/Systems) at the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) Critical and Essential Power Systems (ACEPS) sites for Enersys (formerly Exide) battery models DDV85-33 and DDV95-33.  The batteries are 1360 Amp Hour batteries that need 1248 Amps to discharge to 1.75 end volts at the 15-minute rate.  The tester should also be capable of performing on the E-UPS (Test Uninterruptible Power System) batteries, model number DDV75-21, and 48V control batteries, model numbers DDV40-19 and DDV40-13. The UPMs provide backup power to critical National Airspace System (NAS) facility equipment during commercial power outages.  Failure of a UPM during a commercial power outage can disable critical equipment, such as radar screens.  A delay in bringing a UPM back on-line can cause a major disruption in air travel nationwide.  With battery testers at each site, system specialists can recharge individual batteries as they weaken, rather than recharging an entire battery string of 192 batteries each time an individual battery is underperforming.  This will extend the life of these critical UPM batteries and reduce the occurrence of UPM failures. The FAA is contemplating a one-time acquisition of 30 battery testers. The proposed tester must meet all of the following salient characteristics. SINGLE CELL TESTER/CHARGER SPECIFICATIONS 1.  The single cell charger/tester shall provide a programmable load to the cell up to 500 Amps. 2.  The single cell charger/tester shall have the ability to step charge a single cell IAW IEEE 1188. 3.  The single cell charger/tester shall operate the testing/discharge and charging without removal of the cell from the string. 4.  The single cell charger/tester shall be able to provide a report that is transportable via e-mail. 5.  The single cell charger/tester shall be programmable (adjustable) to provide the output voltage during a charge to include equalization levels. 6.  The single cell charger/tester shall have a load that is adjustable up to at least 500 Amps (1000 Amps preferred). 7. The single cell charger/tester shall be able to complete a discharge test and recharge unattended. Respondents are required to provide, for FAA review, the characteristics of their product in the same terms and units listed above.  All products submitted must meet each of the seven salient characteristics. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No prices/pricing information is to be submitted at this time.  Technical documentation/descriptive literature must be received by the  FAA, Customer Service Desk (AMQ-140) 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125 no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, April 2, 2004.  Hand-carried responses (or responses sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 321 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Required technical documentation must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Technical Documentation; RFI # 59-AML; due 3:00 p.m. CST, April 2, 2004. Respondents are advised that due to the enhanced security measures recently implemented at the Aeronautical Center, access to the center is limited and hand delivery of responses will be permitted under FAA escort only.  Overnight delivery of responses to this RFI could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures now in place at the Aeronautical Center. This RFI is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested technical documentation. Inquiries regarding this RFI should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie M. Houpt,  (405) 954-7820.

<DESC>USAID’s Regional Office for Economic Development for East and Southern Africa (REDSO/ESA) was established in 1972 as a service-oriented organization to provide technical and support services to client USAID Missions and African partners in the ESA region. Currently, REDSO/ESA, co-located in Nairobi with USAID/Kenya, has three mandates. It carries out a regional program to enhance east and southern African institutional capacity to achieve food security, better contain and prevent conflict, and improve regional health systems, with special emphasis on HIV/AIDS. It works with and provides support to African intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to carry out activities in these three areas.  The program also complements and creates synergies with the bilateral programs of USAID missions.

REDSO’s second mandate is to provide technical and support services to 23 other USAID bilateral and non-presence programs in east and southern Africa. Services include a broad range of areas including financial management, environmental impact analysis, procurement, legal assistance, management of food assistance, strategic planning and evaluation. The third mandate is management responsibility for programs in Somalia, Burundi and Djibouti.  The Sudan Field Office which is co-located with REDSO/ESA is an important client.  REDSO has a prominent role in carrying out Presidential and Agency initiatives in the region, and works closely with other agencies and offices within USAID, particularly the U.S. Department of State, and USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.
 

In order to better carry out its mandates, REDSO/ESA requires the services of an experienced U.S. Personal Services Contract Project Development Officer.  This position will be based in Nairobi, Kenya.  Travel may be also required to Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Djibouti and/or REDSO client missions in the region.  Overall duties of this position are defined below. 

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The Project Development Officer is a critical member of REDSO/ESA’s Office of Program Development and Implementation (PDI) and reports directly to the PDI Office Director.  He/she will serve as Office Director in the absence of the incumbent.  PDI’s responsibilities include:  overall guidance to program planning, activity design and implementation, and results reporting; program operations and budgeting support; strategic planning and monitoring and impact assessment; management of REDSO’s service planning, tracking, analysis and reporting; public relations; information and communications technology services; and management of a large cross sectoral program focused on the Horn of Africa, which will be coming to closure in FY 2004.  PDI’s current staffing pattern includes 1 US Direct Hire (USDH), 4 US Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 12 Foreign Service National (FSN) professional and support positions.

The Project Development Officer will provide the full complement of project/program backstop services to REDSO Strategic Objective and Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Djibouti teams, working with Kenyan, American, and other African staff in PDI and in REDSO, and with partner organizations.  The Project Development Officer assures the effective operation of PDI.  He/she will lead SO Teams in the design, implementation and evaluation of program activities supporting REDSO’s three mandates.  He/she will also supervise PDI’s ICT and services tracking functions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to use a Performance-Based Services Acquisition methodology to issue multiple awards in 2005 to procure support for the JSC.  Awards will be in  the areas of Engineering Support Services (ESS) to include database services, Information Technology and Facility Management.  This announcement is a request for information related to the ESS portion of the future acquisition.    
The JSC mission is to enable effective and efficient use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and control of electromagnetic environmental effects (E3) in support of national security and military objectives.  The JSC is striving to improve and expand upon the E3 and spectrum management support it presently provides to the DoD community and the other users of JSC services.  The overall JSC objective is to consistently provide responsive, best value, E3 and spectrum management analysis and engineering support for the operational, research and development communities and to provide access to accurate and comprehensive EM spectrum information as well as the analytical capabilities that will permit the timely and accurate assessment of EM.  Complementing and supporting the aforementioned, it is the JSC’s objective through this procurement of engineering support services to : (1) Enhance the warfighters ability to dynamically link and completely integrate electromagnetic spectrum use with battlefield operations through a set of distributed and automated electromagnetic spectrum capabilities; (2) Improve the comprehensiveness of JSC databases and provide real-time  accessibility of those databases in a network-centric environment; (3) Provide analyses capabilities that will enable the operational and acquisition communities to adequately address SM and E3 in the requirements generation and acquisition processes to ensure effective operations; (4) Improve spectrum and E3 knowledge of policy makers, the development community and warfighters, and (5) Advance the art and science of spectrum management and E3 engineering.   Finally, the JSC has an objective to have active, verifiable, quality control and audit procedures that will provide an accurate assessment of how the JSC and ESSC are meeting performance objectives. To assist the government in its market research, request that all firms interested in the ESS portion of this acquisition submit a short synopsis (not to exceed 10 pages) discussing engineering support services experience in areas that directly support, or are similar to, the JSC engineering support services objectives and any experience in performance based services contracts.  Inputs should be provided to the identified Contracting Officer.

Shuey is the only contractor who can  update and support the existing government software in the time it is required.    The updated program must be delivered by 15 June 2004.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received before  19 March 20 04 at 1pm will be considered by the Government for the purposes of determining whether to compete the requirement.   Commercial procedures are not being used.

The BLM and FS Fire Management programs will utilize the new SMJ Parachute System to aerially deliver Smokejumpers to wild land fire incidents under the following conditions: parachuting into remote wild land areas and landing in open fields or meadows where a variety of surface features will be encountered (to include grass, brush or snow ground cover, hard, soft, wet, or dry surface conditions); parachuting into small or confined landing areas that are surrounded by trees; parachuting into sites with mission specific equipment attached to the parachute harness system; parachuting into mountainous areas that may include any of or a combination of the conditions previously referenced; with Smokejumper experience levels varying from 0 to 600 jumps.  The New SMJ Parachute System basic design shall be a non-developmental, commercially available product.  The New SMJ Parachute System must be flight proven.  Some design adjustments to the basic design will be acceptable to meet the requirements of the specification released with the Solicitation.  The New SMJ Parachute System shall include the required Main Canopy Sub-assembly, Reserve Canopy Sub-assembly, Pack/Harness Sub-assembly, Automatic Activation Device Sub-assembly, and components such as risers, bridles, deployment bags, pilot chutes, cushioning and hardware necessary for a fully operational and safe parachute ready for jumping in Static Line configuration.  It shall meet requirements of the specification at the time of proposal submission, and shall retain this certification throughout deliveries, testing and its entire life.  The harness and container assembly must be compatible with a variety of appropriate main and reserve canopies.  Due to the need to integrate the requirements of two agencies, and multiple Smokejumper bases, the proposal and evaluation process will involve multiple phases.  All vendors who believe they meet the technical requirements of the solicitation, estimated to be released on April 13, 2004 will be invited to submit technical proposals on or around May 11, 2004.  Technical proposals will be evaluated based on criteria identified in the Solicitation and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit a complete assembly to the Government for a Phase II Ground Test.  Assemblies will be evaluated based on Ground Test criteria identified in the Solicitation, and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit a price proposal, (8) complete assemblies, and (2) representatives representing their firm to the Government for the Phase III Jump Test.   Assemblies will be evaluated based on Jump Test criteria identified in the Solicitation and the vendor who is deemed to represent the best value to the government, considering technical, past performance, and price, will be awarded a contract for a minimum of 60 complete assemblies with options for 1,000 to 1,500 addtional units to be purchased over four option years.  Options will be exercised contingent upon the results of a field evaluation that will occur in the 2005 Fire Season.  Due to the complexities of the proposal and evaluation process, a Pre-proposal conference will be held in Denver one week after the Solicitation has been posted, on or about April 21, 2003.  The approximate milestone schedule for this acquisition is as follows: (1) Solicitation released 4/13/04; (2) Pre-proposal conference in Denver 4/21/04; (3) Technical Proposal due date 5/11/2004; (4) Phase I Technical Evaluation in Denver 5/17/04 to 5/21/04; (5) Phase II Ground Test in Boise, ID 6/28/04 to 7/09/04; (6) Phase III Jump Test in Boise, ID or elsewhere as weather permits 10/04/04 to 11/15/04; (7) Contract Award 01/04/2005; (8) Receipt of 60 complete assemblies 4/26/05; (9) Phase IV Field Test Summer 2005 Fire Season; (10) Option Exercise for up to 1,500 additional assemblies over four years 2006 through 2009.  The proposed contract is unrestricted and will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis as an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and four options.  Offerors will be requested to visit the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.eps.gov to download a copy of the solicitation.  A written copy of the solicitation will not be made available.  All offerors are reminded that in order to be eligible for contract award registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/ is now required.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to enter into a sole source contract with Children's Hospital of Oakland, BACPAC Resources, 474 52nd Street, Oakland, CA 94609 and Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason Research Ctr, 1201 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA. 98101.  The Genetics Branch goal is to sequence relevant chromosomal breakpoints through the use of long-range PCR with reference to the completed sequence of the human genome.  The Genetics Branch supports extramural and private initiatives for structural characterization of cancers and derived cancer cell lines by "conventional" as well as novel sequencing technologies.  The Genetics Branch intentions are to: 1) build a foundation of data sets representing the elucidation of the genome anatomy for selected tumors, cell lines, and cell lineages, 2) integrate these data sets with data on gene expression, morphology, virulence, and other phenotypic parameters, and 3) use the foundation of the initial work for the formulation of testable hypotheses concerning required steps in the development and progression of cancer, lineage specific mechanisms of instability, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the basis of evolutionary selection or programmatic choice.  In brief, the Genetics Branch screening process for sequences of interest is to develop four categories of clones: 1) those whose ends are consistent with the known contiguity of the human genome sequence; 2) those whose two ends appear to be discontinuous compared to the human genome sequence and for which there exists more than one independent example where the two novel genomic regions are juxtaposed; 3) those where there is one example of a novel juxtaposition but additional molecular cytogenetic data supports this novel juxtaposition; and 4) those for which there is only one example of a novel juxatposition.  The Genetics Branch, CCR requires the services of the Children's Hospital of Oakland its staff and Benaroya Research Institute and its staff for the preparation of BAC libraries that are the prerequisite for this project.  The Children's Hospital of Oakland and Benaroya Research Institute are the only sources known to the NCI with the specific vectors, the track record of production of appropriately high tittered and arrayed libraries, and the staffing required for the preparation of this project.  However, if any interested party believes that it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail with the necessary documentation to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EST, on March 26, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to cb106x@nih.gov., attention Cynthia Brown, Purchaising Agent.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 541380.  Please include the solicitation number RFQ-NCI-40007-NQ on all correspondence.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Joshua Bowers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2104
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Ada, OK, with Mississippi State University Chemical Lab (MSU) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to analyze sediments and water for the presence and concentrations of organic contaminants. The requirement includes analyses for Organochlorines/PCB's as Arochlors and Aliphatic & Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons on all the samples.    MSU previously provided these analyses on the first batch of samples for this project. Now, EPA has  identified a second batch of samples that need to be analyzed.   This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA market research indicates the Mississippi State University Chemical Lab is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to conduct these  analyses. Since these analyses are a natural progression from previous work completed, it would take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the  work already completed. Moreover, the remaining set of samples must be analyzed in the exact same manner as the previous set. MSU  is the only known source that can ensure consistency in methods and data generation between the first set of samples and the current set. MSU will ensure consistency in data reporting and analytical procedures used so the results from the first set of samples can be compared to the results of the  current set of samples. Since the original work was completed by MSU, and because of their unique familiarity with this project, they are the only known contractor capable of completing the requirements within the required time limitations. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA  requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Friday, March 26, 2004 at 3:00 PM EST).   A determination not to compete the proposed purchase  order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under  FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.  The anticipated award date is April 1, 2004. Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email  (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing RFQ-OH-04-00069.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program in 1979.  The primary objective of this program was and continues to be the systematic evaluation of the risk-significance of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor operational events.  Under this requirement, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) of the NRC will systematically evaluate U.S. nuclear plant operating experience to identify and document the operating events that were most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and severe core damage (precursors), if additional failures had occurred.  Using standardized models provided by the NRC, the contractor shall perform detailed risk analyses of events or conditions that have occurred during all phases of reactor operations.  The contractor shall also provide technical on-call support to NRC staff for in-house analysis of other operating events.   
It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty-one (41) months.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available about January 22, 2004, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Closing date for proposals will be on or about February 23, 2004.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity.  The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  The deadline for receipt of questions is by 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 10, 2004.  Offerors are advised that questions after this date will not be considered.

Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.  Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.

<DESC>The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Contracts and Procurement intends to issue a Full and Open Competition solicitation for RSPA’s Programmatic IT Support Services in April 2004.  Programmatic services will include support for the Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS), Pipeline Information Processing Enforcement System (PIPES), Integrated Operator Compliance System (IOCS) and Online Data Entry System (ODES) and support for RSPA’s regional and field offices.  The HMIS, PIPES, IOCS and ODES are the primary source of national data for the Federal, State, and local government agencies responsible for the safety of hazardous materials transportation.  The principal role of these systems is to collect and distribute information on hazardous materials spills, pipeline annual and incident reporting data, and regulatory activities.  These activities demand immediate response to numerous inquiries by personnel from RSPA, DOT, and various other Federal, state and local government agencies, members of Congress, the news media and the private sector.  RSPA anticipates that  the contract period of performance will be for a base year (12 months), four (4) option years, and a potential of 5 award-term years of 12 months each, for a maximum possible period of performance of ten (10) years.  RSPA anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee type contract with Award Term incentives.  This Pre-solicitation notice announces that RSPA intends to release a solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP)) for this requirement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541513 and the small business size standard is $21 million.  RSPA intends to make available a copy of the solicitation electronically in approximately 30 days after this posting, website: http://www.rspa.dot.gov, under Procurement Opportunities.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be made available.  This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR 8(a) BUSINESSES.

On June 10, 2003, the Department of Transportation’s Chief Information Office (DOT CIO) issued an Action Memorandum requiring the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) to transition its requirement for Information Technology (IT) Support Services to the Department.  RSPA did so.  Since then, several significant events have occurred.  The DOT CIO has defined IT consolidation as a requirement for the DOT Headquarters facility only. Therefore, RSPA must support all regional and field IT operations.  Next, recent budgetary action by Congress has constrained the Departmental CIO’s ability to rapidly transition the DOT to a consolidated infrastructure.  Lastly, DOT has notified Congress of its proposal to restructure RSPA in to the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) to better meet the Department’s mission and operations.  RSPA and the CIO have determined that the LAN Management and Help Desk Support portion of the IT support services will remain a part of the DOT Consolidated IT infrastructure.  RSPA’s programmatic activities (Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS), Pipeline Information Processing Enforcement System (PIPES), Online Data Entry System (ODES), and Integrated Operator Compliance System (IOCS)) and its regional and field support activities) will be a separate requirement. 

The contract the Department has to provide the consolidated IT Support services to RSPA ends on March 15, 2004.   RSPA plans to award a short-term (6 month) sole source bridge contract to Catapult for the programmatic IT support services. See Number Note 22.  This is intended only as a temporary measure until RSPA can implement a full and open 8 (a) competition.  RSPA will soon announce the competition for this requirement with intent to award a new 8(a) contract by September 15, 2004.

<DESC>The Department of State intends to enter into negotiations with Gelco Information Network GSD, Inc. (Gelco), 1860 Michael Faraday Drive, Suite 150, Reston, VA 20190-5304, for maintenance and support services for the Department’s worldwide Travel Manager system.  The system to be supported is comprised of Gelco’s proprietary Travel Manager COTS software package with customizations for the Department to enable audits and data interfaces with the Department’s core financial management system (Central Financial Management System).  The Department acquired and holds software licenses for Gelco’s Travel Manager.  The Department has recently begun preparing for a migration to the new, mandated, government-wide Travel Service (eTS) and will soon begin a phased implementation to one of the Government approved vendors/service providers.  It is projected that the new eTS will eventually replace the Department’s implementation of Travel Manager.  In the interim, the Department requires continued maintenance and support of the current Travel Manager system so that there are no gaps in service from our current system until the Department completes the migration to eTS.  The Department’s phased, multi-year migration of travel management functions to eTS is anticipated to be completed in FY 2008.  The resultant contract is projected to be for a four-year period (a one-year base with 3 one-year option periods). All responsible sources shall respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical information literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. No telephone requests will be honored. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding with negotiations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Contract provides for the focusing of force capabilities centered upon the processes, system of systems and regulatory basis of force management and the capabilities that must be  sustained through management of doctrinal, organizational and materiel change.

<DESC>Department of the Army, Defense Contracting Command-Washington, 5200 Army Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20310-5200 intends to award a single source contract (IAW FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source) to SAIC, 1710 SAIC Drive, McLean, VA 22102,  for a follow-on contract entitled 'Net Assessments and Future Defense Planning'.  Net assessments thorough comparative studies of the competitive environment have long proven to be immensely valuable to senior officials within the Department of Defense.  Struc tured to take a long-term view, assessments have played a large role in defense management by revealing emerging problems and opportunities for top managers to improve the overall position of the United States in the long-term competition.  Yet, as the com petitive environment has changed with the emergence of the United States as the world's sole superpower, the Department of Defense requires the services of a qualified contractor to assess past and future defense planning net assessments.  The period of pe rformance of this contract will be for six (6) months with one six (6) month option. No RFP will be available for competitive proposals.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the March 11, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

D.        STRATEGY AND CONTEXT
 
1.	     USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy, 2003-2006 

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for a newly established economic growth component:
Agency Objective: Broad-based Economic Growth and Agricultural Development Encouraged
Strategic Objective 279-007:  Increased Income Opportunities and Food Security in Selected Governorates
IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption
IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
IR 7.3  Improved Framework for Economic Growth

2.	Context:  

Yemen is a crucial ally in the US-led war against terrorism. The capacity of Yemen to fulfill its role as an ally, however, is dependent upon its ability to decrease poverty and improve its overall economic performance.  According to a 1998 World Bank study, 18% of the Yemeni population live in absolute poverty, and 42% of the population are incapable of meeting their food and non-food requirements. Most of Yemen’s poor live in the countryside, who rely to a large degree on imported food, at subsidized prices.  Oil income, an important component to the national economy, is forecasted to decline steadily well into the future and will soon be a negligible source of foreign earnings. 
  
Agriculture:  Yemen is predominantly rural (75%) and the agricultural sector plays an important role in the Yemeni economy, not because of its contribution to GDP – though small and declining (24% of GDP in 1990 - 15% in 2000) – but because it provides employment to more than half (61%) of the labor force, livelihood to more than three-quarters of the population, and contributes about a third of total non-oil merchandize exports.     

Potential for growth in key sectors: The  World Bank believes that “rapid employment-generating economic growth (in Yemen) will only be possible if agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing lead the way.  (However) Rising domestic security concerns, excessive and arbitrary regulations in infrastructure and services, weak legal and judicial systems, and difficulties in securing land titles hamper output expansion in most of these sectors”…(furthermore)…”reliance on domestic demand limits the prospects for faster and sustained GDP growth.  The impact of policy reforms (flexibility of the exchange rate and trade liberalization) made a significant impact on the competitiveness and good performance of exports.  Such gains need to be preserved and enhanced by deeper liberalization and improvement in trade-related infrastructure and services.”  

Trade:  Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among the most open and trade liberalized countries in
the MENA region. Nonetheless, most of Yemen’s current non-oil exports remain primary, low value-added
products which also make economic growth more vulnerable to volatility in price and demand.  

Government Policy:  The ROYG would like to improve human capacity particularly among women, enhance
living standards, lower population growth rates, diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue,
and raise per capita income. 

Structural Adjustment:  US$550 million in financing was extended to Yemen from 1995-2001 by the World Bank, the IMF and bilateral donors to support a ROYG economic reform process that resulted in a unified and liberalized the exchange regime, reduced subsidies on fuels and wheat, a restructured banking sector, simplified and liberalized trade, a reduced external debt burden, and improve monetary policy and control.  In an October 2002 meeting in Paris, donors pledged a US$2.3bn economic support package to support the Yemen poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) for economic development.  Key elements in phase two include: strengthening governance, civil service reform, decentralization, judicial reform, fiscal revenue and expenditure reform including tax system reform to broaden the tax base and enhance revenue collection and reductions in non-productive spending including diesel oil subsidies which cost 3% of GDP. 

3.	USAID Development Response

Although the primary concentration in SO-007 will be on the agriculture sector USAID will allocate some funds for technical assistance to the ROYG to investigate opportunities for expanded exports and trade and to support the ROYG Central Statistical Office to improve data for development planning.  The activities under SO 297-007 are illustrated within the three Intermediate Results in the Strategy: 

IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption

USAID will assist GoY to improve crop and livestock specification and improve growing techniques; reduce wastage; improve access to inputs (e.g. seeds, feed); support community-based producers associations; expand access to electricity; assist businesses that support the agriculture sector; technical support to women food producers for consumption in the home through community-based outreach.            

IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
  
USAID will support improved access to infrastructure (e.g. electricity, roads) for agricultural related businesses;  improve product quality, processing and packaging; support private sector marketing co-ops; expanded access to credit; market research and development; marketing and advertising; expanding regional and international partnerships.

The USAID Representative to Yemen.

S/He will be expected to coordinate and collaborate with the Embassy’s Pubic Diplomacy Education and Cultural Affairs unit.  


D.	STRATEGY AND CONTEXT

1.	The USAID Yemen Interim Strategy for 2003-2006

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for the educational support component:
Agency Objective: Human Capacity Built through Education and Training
Strategic Objective 297-006:  Improved Basic Education, Especially for Women and Girls
IR 6.1:  Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
IR 6.2:  Increased Literacy and Numeracy Opportunities at the Community Level   
IR 6.3: Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   

2.	Context 

Limited levels of education and literacy are a human capital constraint to economic development in Yemen.  In the rural areas where three-fourths of Yemeni’s live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no formal education at all or have failed to complete primary school. Most (91%) of ever-married rural women are illiterate and most do not compensate by getting information from either radio or television. 

Access:  Education attainment in Yemen is among the lowest in the world.  Although an estimated 2.6 million children are in primary school, about half (approximately 2.5 million) of the primary-school age children (age group between 6 and 11 years old) are not in school.  Gender disparity is pronounced.  In 2001 the Primary Education Net Enrollment Rate (NER) was 61.3% among boys compared to 41.1 % among girls.  According to the 1999 National Poverty Survey, only 45% of rural primary age children (age group between 6 and 11) were currently enrolled in formal schooling, while 71% of urban children were enrolled.  Rural female students are the most disadvantaged (30% enrolled), compared to the urban female students (71% enrolled).   Finally, the retention rate for female students is only 33 percent compared to 68 percent for male students.

Quality: To some extent the poor quality of primary education reflects the low qualification of teachers, especially in rural areas.  The 2000/01 Education Survey estimates that only 40 percent of teaching staff hold secondary school certificates or better, the balance (60% of teachers) have completed only basic education, with one or two years of additional training.  The primary school curriculum and textbooks have been updated recently but the majority of grade 4-6 students have difficulty relating what they have learned in the classroom to what they observe in their environment; explaining and interpreting the meaning of phenomena due to the lack experimentation in school; in mental calculations to resolve problems; and reading and interpreting tables and graphs; and most students have limited reading and writing skills.  Although in-service teacher training is being expanded, primary education still faces serious difficulties, including inadequate school buildings, shortage of teaching and learning materials, and weak community involvement and regional shortages of teachers, especially in rural areas.

Government of Yemen Policy:  

The Government  of Yemen (GOY) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states that  education is a key driver for economic and social development, and sustainable human development.  Basic education is considered essential for rural development and the agricultural sector, and is fundamental to increase industrial productivity.  The teaching of girls is an important factor to improve maternal and infant health and nutrition, as well as to reduce fertility, and to bring about social change in women’s position in society.  Thus, the education strategy in Yemen focuses on four basic principles:  (i) improve the quality of education; (ii) improve the management of the sector and the orientation towards decentralization; (iii) give priority to basic education; and (iv) focus on girls’ education, with the aim of increasing the overall enrollment rate. 

3.	USAID Development Response

The following are illustrative activities in the education sector from the USAID Interim Strategy:
 
IR 6.1	Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
The USAID program will construct, renovate and equip a limited number of elementary schools in partnership with community organizations with special attention to physical constraints to girls’ participation (e.g. separate latrines).   The majority of construction, rehabilitation and equipment will be supported by the USDA 416(b) local currency program.   To improve the quality of education, USAID will also train teachers (especially female teachers) and administrators with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry -based, teaching methods.  USAID will also explore opportunities to provide nutrition and other incentives to increase enrolment and retain children in school through other USDA programs (e.g. Food for Education).

IR 6.2	Increased Literacy and Numeracy  Opportunities at the Community Level 
With large numbers of children out of school (especially girls) and virtually all rural women uneducated and illiterate,  USAID education activities must reach out and provide life-experience-relevant, essential literacy and numeracy opportunities in rural communities.  USAID will increase education outreach to adults (especially women) and out-of-school youth in rural communities; radio/video distance-learning activities; organize parents’ and women’s education circles, community-based organizations and teacher/parent committees. 
 
IR 6.3	Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   
	USAID will develop and implement district and governorate education plans with community participation; fund education planning and program grants; promote new teaching approaches such as interactive and inquiry-based, learning; improve policies and regulations; include life-skills in the curriculum; develop policies and activities for out-of-school youth; provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and to district and governorate education offices to implement the ROYG decentralization objects and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy; provide technical assistance to ROYG at all levels to collect, use and share education data for planning and management; explore IT applications to support program objectives.

<SOLNBR>DTFAAC-04-R-56864
<RESPDATE>031604
<CONTACT>Connie Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>Modification 1 issued 3/11/04 to clarify that batteries submitted for this requirement must be a 5-year or greater battery. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for an estimated annual quantity of 530 each wet batteries, NSN 6140-01-302-0574, General Motors part number S2000 or Delco Remy part number S2000, or Equal.  The batteries are required in support of the Aircraft Instrument Landing System (ILS).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 335912.  The proposed Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract will include option provisions to renew for four (4) additional one-year periods. This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition limited to small business concerns.  Under normal conditions the ILS is powered by commercial AC electrical power, and the batteries are constantly Float charged by 27 volts DC with two batteries in series, or 13.5 volts per battery.  Also, the system has Voltage Foldback circuit that limits the battery charging rate to approximately 2 Amps.  In the event of AC power loss, the standby batteries must immediately supply the current (about 7 Amps) to continue the operation of the ILS system for a minimum of six hours.  When commercial power is restored, the batteries will be slowly recharged to their maximum capacity. If offering other than General Motors part number S2000 or Delco Remy part number S2000, the proposed battery must be a 5-year or greater battery and meet the following salient characteristics. Salient Characteristics Per FAA-E-2826 1.2.1(a)		Type-I Lead-Acid batteries, Stationary Standby Float [Automotive  type batteries for Stationary Standby systems are specifically prohibited by the National Electrical Code of 1987, article 700-12(a).] 1.2.2(c)		Class-3 Lead-Acid batteries, Sealed, No Maintenance 1.2.3(a)		Style  A: Free Electrolyte, or  Orientation or Attitude Sensitive 3.2.1 Battery voltage  12 volts nominal 3.2.2(a)		Battery Capacity  100 Ampere-hour, Deep Cycle 3.2.2(b)		Discharge Rate  Must supply 7 Amperes for a minimum of 6 hours 3.2.2(c)	Charge Rate  Constant 13.5 Volt floating charge, with charging current limited to a maximum of 2 amperes 3.2.3              Battery Condition  Charged and Wet:  Shipped fully charged and ready to use 3.2.3.1              Efficiency  When tested for Ampere-hour efficiency, the ratio of Ampere/hours of  	discharge to the Ampere-hours of recharge shall not be less than 85 percent. 3.2.5	Float Charging  The battery shall not be damaged by float charging and shall accept float charging. 3.2.6(c)(1)	Life Cycle of Battery  100 cycles total, of which 50 cycles are discharges of from 90% to 100% of specified capacity, 30 cycles are discharges of from 75% to less than 90% of specified capacity, and 20 cycles are discharges of from 40% to less than 75% of specified capacity.  Recharges shall be initiated within 2 hours after the end of discharging, except that one recharge per year may be delayed 48 hours.

<DESC>Solicitation /Synopsis:  This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The Northern American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 423720, and employee standard size of 500.  The proposed contract listed is set aside for small businesses.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE:  A complete pulse-jet dust collector system Torit Model 81MBW10 or equal.  The system shall be capable of providing continuous on-line cleaning for a volumetric flow rate of 11000 SCFM.  The collector system shall operate at an air-to-media ratio of 8.5 :1 (FPM).  The model shall include 10’ filter bags.  The pulse-jet bag collector shall be supplied in factory-assembled units sized to meet airflow capacities and design requirements. The collector shall have a bolted and welded construction using 12 gauge HRS and designed for a +/- 20” water gauge. The unit shall come complete with pulse-jet pipework, 1” single diaphragm valves, pilot solenoid valves in NEMA control boxes, 4” square x 3/16 wall square tubing compressed air manifold, 4”x 4”structural support legs with cross-bracing, lifting lugs and discharge hoppers with 18” x 18” inside dimension flanged discharge openings with a minimum angle of 60 degree from horizontal.  The backside of the hopper shall be a quick opening 22” diameter hopper access door for each hopper.  The compressed air reservoir shall be provided with 1” NPT pipe coupling at both ends for attachment of clean and dry compressed air supply at 90-100 PSIG and at a temperature exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  Round-shaped, filter bags made of 16 ounces of polyester felt material with untreated finish shall be supplied.  The round bags and galvanized cages shall be secured to the ¼” plate tubesheet by a radial compressive force supplied by a stainless steel spring band in the bag cuff and the cage cap to provide an airtight seal between the bags and tubesheet.  This bag and cage combination is not recommended for applications requiring electrical grounding.  The filter bags shall be arranged in a vertical configuration, serviced from inside the collector walk-in clean air section.  Dust-laden air shall enter the collector through the hopper, impact against a target plate deflecting heavy material down into the hopper.  The rest of the dust-laden air passes up through the collector in a flow pattern that has been engineered to minimize abrasion and provide even dust loading  on the media surface.  Clean air will pass through the media, enter the clean air chamber and exit the collector.  The collector shall be controlled by a solid-state printed circuit cleaning control.  The cleaning control shall progressively energize pilot solenoid valves, which cause the corresponding diaphragm valve to send a pulse of 90-100 PSIG supply compressed air into the blowpipe.  The pulse will be discharged from the air manifold through the diaphragm valves, through the blowpipe, through the filter venturi, and into the filter bags.  The high-pressure pulse will enter the inside of the bags, blowing the dust from the surface of the media.  One row of bags shall be cleaned per pulse.  Dust will be discharged from the hopper(s) at the base of the collector.  Collector is to be explosion protected and designed in compliance with NFPA 68.  Explosion venting required.

<DESC>Solicitation /Synopsis:  This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The Northern American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 423720, and employee standard size of 500.  The proposed contract listed is set aside for small businesses.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE:  A complete pulse-jet dust collector system Torit Model 81MBW10 or equal.  The system shall be capable of providing continuous on-line cleaning for a volumetric flow rate of 11000 SCFM.  The collector system shall operate at an air-to-media ratio of 8.5 :1 (FPM).  The model shall include 10’ filter bags.  The pulse-jet bag collector shall be supplied in factory-assembled units sized to meet airflow capacities and design requirements. The collector shall have a bolted and welded construction using 12 gauge HRS and designed for a +/- 20” water gauge. The unit shall come complete with pulse-jet pipework, 1” single diaphragm valves, pilot solenoid valves in NEMA control boxes, 4” square x 3/16 wall square tubing compressed air manifold, 4”x 4”structural support legs with cross-bracing, lifting lugs and discharge hoppers with 18” x 18” inside dimension flanged discharge openings with a minimum angle of 60 degree from horizontal.  The backside of the hopper shall be a quick opening 22” diameter hopper access door for each hopper.  The compressed air reservoir shall be provided with 1” NPT pipe coupling at both ends for attachment of clean and dry compressed air supply at 90-100 PSIG and at a temperature exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  Round-shaped, filter bags made of 16 ounces of polyester felt material with untreated finish shall be supplied.  The round bags and galvanized cages shall be secured to the ¼” plate tubesheet by a radial compressive force supplied by a stainless steel spring band in the bag cuff and the cage cap to provide an airtight seal between the bags and tubesheet.  This bag and cage combination is not recommended for applications requiring electrical grounding.  The filter bags shall be arranged in a vertical configuration, serviced from inside the collector walk-in clean air section.  Dust-laden air shall enter the collector through the hopper, impact against a target plate deflecting heavy material down into the hopper.  The rest of the dust-laden air passes up through the collector in a flow pattern that has been engineered to minimize abrasion and provide even dust loading  on the media surface.  Clean air will pass through the media, enter the clean air chamber and exit the collector.  The collector shall be controlled by a solid-state printed circuit cleaning control.  The cleaning control shall progressively energize pilot solenoid valves, which cause the corresponding diaphragm valve to send a pulse of 90-100 PSIG supply compressed air into the blowpipe.  The pulse will be discharged from the air manifold through the diaphragm valves, through the blowpipe, through the filter venturi, and into the filter bags.  The high-pressure pulse will enter the inside of the bags, blowing the dust from the surface of the media.  One row of bags shall be cleaned per pulse.  Dust will be discharged from the hopper(s) at the base of the collector.  Collector is to be explosion protected and designed in compliance with NFPA 68.  Explosion venting required.

<DESC>THE DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO APRIL 16, 2004.

The SubProduct Service Code for this aquisition is 6505; Drugs & Biologicals.  The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to Intentional or natural disasters.  In 2002, the U.S. Congress established the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OASPHEP).  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to prevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population.

The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OASPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of medical countermeasures to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in preparation for response to a public health emergency.  

Description

The nature and degree of the threat posed by the use of infectious agents as weapons of biological warfare have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States including postal workers, and other U.S. Government (USG) employees to Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective countermeasures to protect those living in the United States from the harmful effects of B. anthracis spores when used as instruments of terror.  Thus, this enduring threat requires an accelerated pace of anthrax recombinant protective antigen (rPA) vaccine development, testing, manufacturing, and acquisition to provide a sufficient stockpile for emergency preparedness and response. 

Abundant preclinical evidence is available to indicate that vaccination with native protective antigen (PA) and the rPA of B. anthracis adsorbed to aluminum salts generates long-lasting protective immunity in animal models against inhalational spore challenge of the disease.  This immunity is mediated by antibody directed at PA, and preclinical and clinical testing to date indicates that rPA will be an effective vaccine against anthrax exposure.  Although future anthrax vaccines may be formulated to include antigens other than rPA and adjuvants other than aluminum salts, these novel components are not requested because their consideration could complicate and delay approval of the vaccine sought in this solicitation.

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is the acquisition and maintenance of  75 million doses of licensed anthrax rPA vaccine for the SNS to protect U.S. citizens against inhalation anthrax.  The contractor will also be required to provide an FDA approval letter and accompanying issuance of appropriate license for a BLA for pre-exposure prophylaxis use of the anthrax rPA vaccine in the SNS; provide an FDA approval letter for a BLA supplement for post-exposure prophylaxis use of anthrax rPA vaccine in combination with antibiotics; maintain ongoing quality control/quality assurance monitoring of the SNS stored product and ongoing stability testing over the life of the contract or the expiration date of the vaccine, whichever comes first; conduct special population trials including pediatric and geriatric populations; and produce a minimum of one (1) lot of bulk product per year to maintain cGMP capacity (a warm base) for the production of the anthrax rPA vaccine for the life of the contract.  It is anticipated that multiple indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for a maximum quantity of  75 million doses of rPA vaccine for the SNS to protect U.S. citizens against inhalation anthrax will be awarded.  However, the Government reserves the right to make one award. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-04-01 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about February 23, 2004.  Responses will be due on or about March 23, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.  All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-04-01 and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Overview

The United States Postal Service’s Package Services group intends to implement a turn-key solution for expedited packaging supplies fulfillment that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves the overall customer ordering experience with regard to supplies.  A vendor will be selected to warehouse packaging supplies inventory, interface with a USPS customer care center to accept orders and communicate order status, act as a liaison on behalf of the Postal Service with various manufacturers of packaging supplies for direct-vendor delivery, and ship orders from its own facilities.  The selected vendor will be further required to maintain order information, and produce summary reports to facilitate product assortment and operational decisions. 

‘Expedited packaging supplies’ refers to those items offered to customers at no additional charge for use with premier USPS services—Express Mail, Priority Mail, and global delivery services.  The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.  Currently, the Postal Service offers customers a total of 68 different packaging-related items.  On average, approximately 162,000 supplies orders, which contain 3.82 items per order, are fulfilled each month.  Of these, approximately 29,000 are orders for one of five different custom-imaged labels.  These items are offered to further enhance customer convenience, and are imaged with 7 to 20 lines of variable text.  The average label order contained 249 labels.

The expedited packaging supplies program is a significant source of customer value and affects customer perception toward the premier offerings of the Postal Service.  Customers place orders for supplies via multiple channels, and this important experience—from order placement through receipt of the supplies order—affects the customer’s perception toward the use of the services themselves.  The supplies fulfillment process, depending on the speed and accuracy with which it is administered, can serve to enhance, or detract from, customer retention.  The fulfillment center is an important part of this dynamic.

Though an important selling tool, the supplies program also carries considerable costs to administer.  For this reason, customer value must be balanced against the cost to the Postal Service of achieving it.  The solution planned seeks to achieve this balance, minimizing costs, while maintaining solid customer support.  To this end, Package Services seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who demonstrate extensive experience in the fulfillment industry, with world-class operations, comprehensive information systems, and a commitment to quality.  A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall reconfiguration, and afford opportunity for one or more strategic partnerships.   

2)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

3)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

4)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to Abacus Technology Corporation for maintenance and consulting support for its Telecommunication Automated Tracking System (TATS). The contractor will provide the Department of Education with maintenance and consulting services, including assisting ED staff with Telecommunications Ordering, Reporting and Inventory System (TORIS) configurations, specifications, code, functionality and general assistance inquiries for a base period of 10 months with 2 option periods of one year each. A sole-source procurement is requested because of the proprietary nature of the application Abacus Technology developed which cannot be obtained from a competitive procurement. Additionally, three other agencies (U.S. Courts, VA and Secret Service) have acquired and developed their own version of TORIS. Abacus Technology Corporation provides maintenance for these applications and periodically makes code changes to enhance system functionality (at no cost to the government). The Department would like to keep Abacus Technology Corporation on in a consulting capacity to keep the application at the same level as the other agencies and take advantage of the ongoing technology. This is not a request for proposals. However, all interested parties should submit a capability statement by the closing date in the notice detailing how it can provide enhancements and version changes to the DoED's product as a result of changes made by Abacus at other Government agencies with the same product at a minimal cost. If any other capable, responsible sources are found, this procurement will be opened for full and open competition.

Scope of Work

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.  This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.  A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.  In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.   Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.  Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.  The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.  The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:  “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the necessary security clearances.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contract Specialists e-mail address or fax number contained herein.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a demonstration of an innovative commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) solution for detonating explosive devices that are command detonated by radio frequency.  The envisioned concept would be a device capable of emitting signals over a broad bandwidth in a relatively short amount of time in order to detonate devices prior to employment by the enemy.  This technology would be used in direct support of contingency operations with its primary purpose to provide a safe corridor for convoy operations.  Solution should have the capability to be vehicle-mounted and have an effective range of approximately one-quarter of a mile.   Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.    The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.    All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.    Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic is seeking sources that can provided the following parts and services for a prototype engine overhaul / modification of a single diesel engine on a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul /Modification will be done at the vessels homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  The known Fairbanks Morse Engine Parts Needed Are:  Part Number 16103236 (16 Needed) Ring, Piston Oil Drain, Spring Loaded; Part Number 16606240 (8 Needed) SVK Piston, Lower-Serv Repl-S. AS; Part Number 16606238 (8 Needed) SVK Piston, Upper Serv Repl-S. AS; 16611472 (16 Needed) Nozzel Assy, Pintle 2400Psi TD 1; 16113439 (1 Needed) Std Pump Vacuum Crankcase 300 C; MISCOP (1 Needed) PLC Controller Jack Wtr and Air Bypass Control; 12996894 (1 Needed) Valve, 4” 3-Way; MISC (1 Needed) Core Charge, Unit Exchange/Reconditioning.  Services being requested are: (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Provide a unit exchange or rebuild existing fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Provide and install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Provide and install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Provide and install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6) Provide elementary wiring schematics for all newly installed components including the proposed connection points into the ship’s existing power supply.  (7) Provide and install a suitable crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (8) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (11) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  The only known source to the Government for the parts and services listed above is Fairbanks Morse Engine, Beloit, WI.  This installation is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype installation goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  Any other business sources, able to provide the above listed parts and services are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days of its publication.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding it capability to provide the above listed parts, services and experience working on this type of engine.  The information should be submitted to the address stated herein or may be faxed to telephone number 757-628-4676, ATTN:  Wendy Culbreth.  The small business size standard is less than 1000 employees and the NAICS Code is 333618.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation.  All responsible sources may respond.

A sortie is considered, an engine start, take-off and landing to engine shutdown which accomplishes student or instructor training curriculum events. The training sorties may be performed as single leg flights originating and terminating at the same site; multiple leg flights which are flown from off-site locations and return to the originating site on the same day or overnight missions.  The aircraft flight time for sorties will vary due to many factors such as type of mission, weather, student ability and air traffic control.  Total flight time per student is approximately 29 hours.  Training missions will normally be flown between approximately 0700 to 2200 hours, Monday through Friday.  The contractor shall support training missions, which occur outside of normal working hours as required. This includes support of weekend operations.

Student Training.  Students will receive approximately 29 hours on 16 sorties with a 5% re-fly rate.  Student production is divided into 15 classes per year starting approximately every three weeks.  Three options are being considered for student throughput.  Option 1. 334 Air Force students per year.  Each student receives 16 flights.  Option 2. 334 Air Force students plus 140 Navy students per year.  Each student receives 16 flights.  Option 3.  334 Air Force students plus 140 Navy students per year.  Each Air Force student receives 16 flights.  Navy students receive 6 flights.  Sorties for Navy students under this option are:  Flight 01 (2.0 hrs per sortie)  Use Instrument procedures during multiple departure and arrival sequences; Flight 02 - 05 Airways Navigation  (2.0 hrs per sortie)  Use mental and manual DR procedures in conjunction with radio aid fixing procedures; Flight 06/06R (Evaluation/Remake) (2.0 hrs per sortie)  Evaluate student performance in all areas of Airways navigation.

Instructor Navigator (IN)Training.  Student instructor navigators will receive eight flights in the right seat of the aircraft.  Flight 01 (2.0 hrs per sortie)  Use Instrument procedures during multiple departure and arrival sequences; Flight 02 - 03 Airways Navigation (2.0 hrs per sortie)  Use mental and manual DR procedures in conjunction with radio aid fixing procedures; Flight 04 - 06 Low Level (1.5 hrs per sortie)  Low-level navigation and airdrop procedures, student directs the aircraft along a route of flight to the drop zone; Flight 07 Cross country (2.5 hrs per sortie)  Instrument approach procedures, emphasizing mission planning, enroute, and strange field procedures. These sorties are normally flown as out-and-backs; Flight 08 (Evaluation) (1.5 hrs per sortie)  Evaluate student performance in all areas of low-level navigation.

Student instructor navigators will receive 8 instructor flights on student sorties.  The typical crew load will be a SN, IN and the student instructor navigator.  The initial cadre will be approximately 100 instructors.  Approximately 45 new instructors will be trained per year.

Aircraft PAI . Initial estimates of Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) required for each of the student training options listed under student training are: Option 1. – 20;  Option 2. – 27; and Option 3. – 22.  The PAI estimates include the estimated hours required for the annual Instructor Navigator training.  The majority of the initial cadre training will be accomplished prior to the start of student training.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Wound Care Items  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various wound care items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for wound care items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process, with the exception of mattresses, which may be returned after an award, is made at the offeror’s request and at the offeror’s expense. NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  A statement that says, “Yes, this product meets this criteria” is not sufficient; please provide details as to how the product meets the criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract and the anticipated contract award date. The VHA Wound Care User Group, a group of VA nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.   **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   NOTE – Because of the bulky nature of the mattress samples and the need to receive them at the dock, mattress samples will only be accepted between the hours of 8:00 am and 11:00 am. SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN APRIL 2, 2004.  Companies not submitting samples by this date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.  For additional information regarding contracting issues please contact Sue Proctor (708) 786-5182.  For additional information regarding submission of samples please contact Carl Hunter (708) 786-7783. Product Descriptions/Criteria for items being considered at this time are as follows: ITEM 1.

<CONTACT>Jason Brunsvold, 3097825081
<DESC>Potential Sources Sought for MK86, MK87, and MK89 EOD Demolition Charges. The Mines, Demolition, and Grenades office of the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are capable of manufacturing MK86, MK87, and MK89 EOD Demolition Charges. The MK86 Demo Charge is a shaped charge that is used in EOD Operations to cut open, render safe to handle or disrupt the functioning of mines or other explosive ordnance devices. It is especially designed for un derwater operations and is non magnetic so that it can be used on a variety of targets.  This charge consists of a short length of flexible linear shaped charge sealed in an aluminum housing which provides the proper standoff for the shaped charge as well as a rigid mount that can be easily attached to the target and hold the initiating/blasting cap in place.  The MK87 Demo Charge is used in EOD Operations to cut open, render safe to handle or disrupt the functioning of mines or other explosive ordnance dev ices. It is especially designed for underwater operations and is non- magnetic so that it maybe used on a variety of targets. This charge consists of a short length of flexible linear shaped charge sealed in a plastic housing which provides the proper stan doff for the shaped charge as well as a rigid mount that can be easily attached to the target and hold the initiating detonator/blasting cap in place.  The MK89 Demo Charge is a sealed, bullet-shaped, plastic-cased charge that contains an explosive charge formed around a plastic case. A detonator hole (capwell) occupies the flat end of the container and there is a void in the rounded end to provide the standoff for the shaped charge.  This charge is designed for EOD Render Safe Procedures on munitions.  The  explosive filler in the MK86 and MK87 is CH-6 while the MK89 uses Comp A-3; both CH-6 and Comp A-3 will be provided as GFM.  Responding firms should indicate their size status under NAICS code #325920 (750 Employees).  A respondent to this survey should b e able to show that they have adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the explosives processing industry, as an indicator of your qualifications as a manufacturer for this item. A respondent to this market survey must h ave available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these charges. Interested companies who feel they have the necessary manufacturing capabilities should respond by providing the government the following information; a b rief summary of the company capabilities, including a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria and estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities that can be produced and the M inimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for production. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If  a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. Information shall be submitted to: US Army Field Support Command, ATTN: Jason Brunsvold, AMSFS-CCA-M, Bldg 3 50 6th FL Rock Island 1, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000. This is a market survey for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the government. The government does not intend to award a contr act on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidenti al status.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has embarked upon several initiatives aimed at transforming the Command’s business model to a more efficient, effective and responsive process.  NAVSEA is seeking all interested parties’ assistance and input on it’s initiative to review the policies, regulations and current practices that drive the “content” and costs of the contracting process at NAVSEA Headquarters and its field activities.  The review will identify policies, regulations and practices that provide little or no added value, in terms of cost, schedule or risk, as well as those policies, regulations and practices that could be improved to help reduce costs and acquisition cycle time.  The review will also include clauses and other solicitation/contract language that may be unnecessarily adding cost and/or cycle time to our hardware and support contracts. Interested parti es are encouraged to provide suggestions to make this review as effective and comprehensive as possible.  Traditional and Non-Traditional Department of Defense contractors, all types of Small Businesses, Government Organizations and Academia are encouraged to participate.  Interested parties are invited to provide suggested revisions to the policies, regulations and practices used in the NAVSEA contracting process.

<DESC>The 913th Airlift Wing MSG/CONF, 1051 Fairchild Street, Willow Grove ARS, PA 19090 intends to negotiate a Sole Source procurement with R. Reiko Miyahara Associates, Inc., 146 Montgomery Avenue, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004-2984 to revise and update a design that they originally completed in 1997 for "Renovation of Wing HQ, Bldg. 203" Willow Grove ARS, PA. Services will require the original designer of record, including the original Principal Engineer, to provide a Professional Engineering certification to any changes to the design without creating an entirely new design. 913th research indicates that only the original design firm can certify changes without duplicating calculations that will have negative impacts to cost and schedule. No other A&E firm can be professionally bound to update a design stamped by another A&E firm. The statutory authority under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Otherwise qualified firms that believe they can provide design services without a negative impact to the project must respond to this notice prior to close of business on 26 April 2004. Offerors responding to this notice must demonstrate their ability to provide an equivalent service, rationale as to why they should be considered and demonstrate that bringing in another A&E firm does not impact costs or schedule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  On behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is coordinating performance tests of commercially available equipment based on the ANSI N42.32, N42.33, N42.34 and N42.35 standards as well as on the test and evaluation protocols for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by various National Laboratories.  The tests are designed to determine the effectiveness of radiation detection instruments that may be used by first responders in a radiological incident. The participating National laboratories are:  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

Interested manufacturers should contact NIST at the address given above.  NIST will supply a Letter of Understanding, which the manufacturer must execute and send to NIST.  NIST will then assign the manufacturer’s equipment to the National laboratory conducting the testing for that type of device and will provide the manufacturer with shipping instructions for their equipment.  All equipment tested under this program must meet the minimum specifications stated in ANSI Standards N42.32 “Performance Criteria for Alarming Personal Radiation Detectors for Homeland Security,” N42.33 “Portable Radiation Detection Instrumentation for Homeland Security,” N42.34 “Performance Criteria for Hand-held Instruments for the Detection and Identification of Radionuclides,” and N42.35 “Evaluation and Performance of Radiation Detection Portal Monitors for Use in Homeland Security,” as detailed below. 

The instruments provided will be tested according to the provisions in the standards and will be returned to the manufacturer after the tests by the National laboratory that performed the tests.  Manufacturers should be aware that some of the testing protocols may damage or destroy the equipment.  At the conclusion of the testing, the equipment will be returned to the Manufacturer, c.o.d., in the condition the equipment is in at the conclusion of the testing. Neither NIST, the Department of Homeland Security, nor any National laboratory will be responsible for the condition of the equipment when returned to the manufacturer.  As a condition for participating in this testing program, each manufacturer must agree in advance to hold harmless all of these parties for the condition of the equipment.
 
The information acquired during the tests will be compiled by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and will be copied to the manufacturer for their instruments. A summary of the results of equipment testing will be made publicly available.  Manufacturers who do not want the results of the testing of their equipment to be made publicly available should not participate in this program.

Participating manufacturers must provide three units of each instrument model. For portal monitors, two units of each instrument model are required.  Manufacturers will pay all shipping costs, but there is no cost to the manufacturer for the testing. For the results to be valid two out of three submitted instruments per model must be operational for all tests. No modifications to the instruments are permitted during the testing process.

<OFFADD>US Army Engineer District, New York, CENAN-CT, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY  10278-0090
<SUBJECT>--New submission requirements for Architect Engineer Services regarding the replacement of SFs 254 and 255 with the SF 330.
<DESC>The final SF 330 was published in the Federal Register on 11 December 2003   (http://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/techinfo/ECB/FedReg-11 Dec 03-Final SF 330.pdf) . The SF 330 replaces SFs 254 and 255. The new form is effective 12 January 2004, and its use is mandatory by 8 June 2004. The New York District will not use the SF 330 until 8 June 2004 to allow the A-E industry sufficient time to become familiar with the new form and for software vendors to develop and market new products. Therefore, Federal Busi ness Opportunities (FedBizOpps) announcements published before 8 June 2004 will still require submission of SFs 254 and 255. FedBizOpps announcements published on or after 8 June 2004 will require submission of SF 330.  The SF 330 reflects current Government and A-E practices and provides the essential information the Corps needs for the selection of A-E firms in a streamlined format. The SF 330 is a two-part form. Part I, Contract-Specific Qualifications, replaces the SF  255. Part II, General Qualifications, replaces the SF 254. Hence, the SF 330 was designed as a single two-part form. Part II, which is only one page, must be completed for each branch office that will have a key role in a proposed contract and submitted w ith the Part I. Also, A-E firms will eventually be required to complete a SF 330, Part II when they register or renew their registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. This will replace submission of SFs 254 to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS). ACASS will be linked to CCR. More information will be provided later on submission of Part II to the CCR.  A PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the information is available at: http://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/techinfo/ECB/SF 330-USACE Training.ppt. In addition the General Services Administration forms website http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary wil l be revised soon to add the SF 330 in various electronic formats.  The New York District will limit the number of pages for SF 330 submissions in the FedBizOpps announcements for A-E services based upon the nature of the solicitation. For most contracts, an adequate submission can be made in approximately 40 pages. Firms are discouraged from repeating information from Sections A-G in Section H (Additional Information). Section H is intended for discussion of selection criteria that are not adequately addressed in the prior structured sections of the form, such as a firms q uality management approach or specialized equipment assets. Also, firms are discouraged from customizing Part II for specific contract submissions. If you have any questions New York DistrictÃ¢Â€Â™s Technical POC is Steve Di Bari. He can be reached at 212-264-9123.

<DESC>Solicitation /Synopsis:  This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The Northern American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 423720, and employee standard size of 500.  The proposed contract listed is set aside for small businesses.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE:  A complete pulse-jet dust collector system Torit Model 81MBW10 or equal.  The system shall be capable of providing continuous on-line cleaning for a volumetric flow rate of 11000 SCFM.  The collector system shall operate at an air-to-media ratio of 8.5 :1 (FPM).  The model shall include 10’ filter bags.  The pulse-jet bag collector shall be supplied in factory-assembled units sized to meet airflow capacities and design requirements. The collector shall have a bolted and welded construction using 12 gauge HRS and designed for a +/- 20” water gauge. The unit shall come complete with pulse-jet pipework, 1” single diaphragm valves, pilot solenoid valves in NEMA control boxes, 4” square x 3/16 wall square tubing compressed air manifold, 4”x 4”structural support legs with cross-bracing, lifting lugs and discharge hoppers with 18” x 18” inside dimension flanged discharge openings with a minimum angle of 60 degree from horizontal.  The backside of the hopper shall be a quick opening 22” diameter hopper access door for each hopper.  The compressed air reservoir shall be provided with 1” NPT pipe coupling at both ends for attachment of clean and dry compressed air supply at 90-100 PSIG and at a temperature exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

Clean air will pass through the media, enter the clean air chamber and exit the collector.  The collector shall be controlled by a solid-state printed circuit cleaning control.  The cleaning control shall progressively energize pilot solenoid valves, which cause the corresponding diaphragm valve to send a pulse of 90-100 PSIG supply compressed air into the blowpipe.  The pulse will be discharged from the air manifold through the diaphragm valves, through the blowpipe, through the filter venturi, and into the filter bags.  The high-pressure pulse will enter the inside of the bags, blowing the dust from the surface of the media.  One row of bags shall be cleaned per pulse.  Dust will be discharged from the hopper(s) at the base of the collector.  Collector is to be explosion protected and designed in compliance with NFPA 68.  Explosion venting required.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Electricians/Lead Electricians that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.    A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be rejected as technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Electricians/Lead Electricians.    The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying as many as two (2) qualified Marine Electricians and a Lead Marine Electrician within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.

The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 3,000 hours, including overtime  (2,400 hrs/Electrician, 600 hours Lead Electrician) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.    These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.    CLIN 0003 - Travel, if required, will be reimbursed in accordance with Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) on a time & materials basis.

On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of marine electricians are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 500 for Electricians and 100 for the Lead Electricians.    The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

In the event of a conflict the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions:
<br>.
Question 1.“I am an American living in Nairobi, Kenya. Could this position be run by someone living in Nairobi?” 
<br>
Answer 1. It is possible that the contractor could carry-out the responsibilities from a base in Kenya. 
<br> 
Question 2.  “Is the position for one or two people?”
<br>
Answer 2.  Up to 4 individuals will be contracted on a personal services basis to be based in various countries in Africa
<br>
Question 3. “When is the person expected to start?”
<br>
Answer 3. Preferably April 15 but no later than May.
<br>
Question 4. “Will ADF accept a proposal from a small business with 2 CVs? If there are two jobs then the recommended people will be proposed for the two jobs. If there is only one position, then the proposal may have the two people sharing the job?”
<br> 
Answer 4.  If there is only one position filled, ADF does not wish to share it between two people.
<br>
Question 5. “What are the main focus industries?”
<br>
Answer 5.  Agriculture, agribusiness processing, horticulture, fisheries, livestock, small scale manufacturing, furniture making, handicrafts, clothing and textiles.
<br> 
Question 6. “What are the main focus countries?”
<br> 
Answer 6. Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Benin,
Senegal, Mali, Cape Verde
<br>
Question 7.“Is this solicitation world wide or limited to US nationals?”
<br>
Answer 7. The solicitation is worldwide.
<br>
Question 8. “12 African countries are mentioned as the possible ‘home base’ for 25% of the time.  Can I know which one is the most likely and is it anticipated that I'll be renting living accommodations?  This information is relevant to my quoting a cost for housing.  Is it anticipated that living accommodations will be rented furnished or unfurnished?  This, of course, relates to the shipment (or not) of HH goods.” 
<br>
Answer 8.  ADF has not determined which of the 12 countries will serve as the home base for the analysts.  All are equally likely at this point.  The contractors will be responsible for their own accommodations.  ADF will not provide accommodations.
<br>
Question 9. “The contractor will be in travel status 75% of the time.  It is stated that either the ADF or the partner organization will provide transportation.  Will they also provide per diem expenses such as lodging and food?  If not, what guidelines should the prospective contractor utilize in determining the cost of these items to be included in the financial section of the proposal?”
<br>
Answer 9.  ADF or its partners will provide transportation and per diem while the contractor is in travel status away from his/her duty station.
<br>
Question 10. “Item 5 of the Evaluation Criteria specifies "Substantial business documentation and presentation skills as evidence……….".   Are you requesting that the proposal contain samples of reports, business plans, financial statements, etc., prepared by the contractor?  If so, what would be considered to be sufficient documentation and in what manner can it be sent (e.g. express surface mail)?”
<br>
Answer 10. Sample work products are not required.  The proposal should contain evidence of experience and/or education that provides the knowledge, skills and abilities described in the announcement.
<br>
Question 11. “The solicitation states: "Your fixed-price shall be all-inclusive to cover benefits you would otherwise receive."  Assuming that these benefits will include Cost of Living and Post Differential, can you advise what are the respective rates for the probable base country?” 
<br>
Answer 11. As the proposal is requested to be a fixed-price all inclusive amount, specific benefits or allowances are not contemplated and are not relevant.
<br>
Question 12. “If the contractor is presently US based, will the late April workshop involve a separate round-trip for this workshop prior to a permanent relocation to the home base in Africa?”
<br>
Answer 12. The Foundation will pay for travel from the country of assignment to the workshop and return to the country of assignment. ADF will also be responsible for the contractor’s travel from their home base to the country of assignment.
<br>
Question 13. “Which tax form will be provided by the ADF to confirm salary - a W2 or 1099?”
<br>
Answer 13. ADF will issue a 1099 if it is required
<br>
Question 14. “The solicitation states: "Please provide evidence of health insurance coverage."  My present US based health insurance (BlueCross/BlueShield) does not cover for overseas medical attention.  I would purchase the appropriate insurance just prior to departure therefore would be unable to provide evidence at the time the proposal is submitted.  Will evidence of BlueCross/BlueShield suffice? How can it be submitted (e.g. fax or express surface mail)?” 
<br>
Answer 14. A statement that you will purchase appropriate health insurance prior to entering on duty will suffice.  Evidence will be required, however, if selected and before entering on duty.
<br>
Question 15. “Will receipt confirmation be provided when the proposal is received?”
<br>
Answer 15.  If you request confirmation. 
<br>
Question 16. “When is ADF's decision anticipated to be known?” 
<br>
Answer 16. As soon as possible.
<br>
Question 17. “Will there be a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) process?”
<br>
Answer 17. You must submit your best price initially.    
<br>
Question 18.  “The solicitation requires an all-inclusive price, but the list of countries where one might be based is long and brings a number of variables into that equation.  Is it possible to specify that a specific proposal is based on being located in one specific country?  Or are there other guidelines that one is supposed to use to determine a price that can accommodate the variability of costs from country to country?”
<br>
Answer 18.  You can submit a proposal that specifies pricing by country.
<br>
Question 19. “What will the expected division of responsibilities be?  There is reference to a five week training program to be provided to partner organizations in the countries where ADF works and then there is reference to the need to conduct project appraisals, financial analysis, industry research, etc. for small business projects.  What is the primary responsibility and what percentage of the contractor's time will that require?”
<br>
Answer 19. ADF anticipates that the training will be completed within four months.  Duties after that will be focused primarily on the project appraisals, financial analysis, industry research, etc. 
<br>
Question 20.  “What type of business remediation activities would the contractor provide to ADF for guidance purposes?”
<br> 
Answer 20.  Helping enterprises solve a range of production management, sales and marketing, operational efficiency, financial analysis, procurement
management, etc. 
<br> 
Question 21. “Raising Capital appears to be an important area and focus, what is ADF looking from the contractor to provide with regards to prospective investors, in raising capital.  Has a budget been set-up with regards to raising money from outside investors, strategic partners and public and private donors?”
<br> 
Answer 21.  Knowledge of donors and private sector investment expectations and investment practices and presentation development.  Budget will be established once the strategy is established.

<br> 
Question 2.“It is unclear whether this is a consulting project where the contractor is to be available to the Foundation for a specified number of days over the course of the contract or whether this is a full-time commitment to be based in ADF offices on a daily basis.  Can you clarify?  How much time or how many days or hours would the successful bidder be expected to be available to ADF?”	
<br> 	
Answer 2.  ADF considers this to be a full-time position.	
<br> 
Question 3.“Are there guidelines on what option year pricing should be based on (what escalation factors are considered reasonable and appropriate)?  Since it is expected to be a 48 month engagement, this could be an issue in later years.”
<br> 
Answer 3. There are no guidelines.  ADF will consider the proposal pricing as a whole.

<DESC>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERES.

Q.  Will the course attendees be the same for all courses? 

A.  No.  We have 36 technicians to train.  There will be 3 sections attending each of the 4 MCSA preparation courses.  Each section contains 12 students.

Q.  The buyer is requesting a 5-day Windows XP Professional course, and a 2-day Windows 2003 TCP/IP course.  Will the buyer allow the 5-Day Windows XP course to be shortened to 3 days, and taught in conjunction with the 2-day Windows 2003 TCP/IP course?  

A.  We would like to purchase test preparation courses for the 4 MCSA courses specified.   Each training course should be 5 days long.

Q.  If the contractor does not intend on using MOC ( Microsoft Official Curriculum), does the buyer want the detailed course outlines included in the proposal?

A.  A top level outline is sufficient.

Q.  Our company specialized in accelerated training.  If the exams will not be done as part of the course, it would be possible to teach the requested courses in a 12 day period.  The training days would be lengthened to 12 hours per day.  The accelerated option would significantly reduce the cost of training, as well as travel costs for students attending the training.

A.  We're not interested in accelerated training.  Travel for students is not authorized.  Courses must be taught at our Alameda facility.

Q.  On the retake for up to one full year.  Are you expecting that to be at no cost?  

A.  No.

Q.  Is it worth submitting an offer if there is a nominal fee for each retake day?

A.  No.  We're asking for 1 year unlimited course retakes to be included in the quote.

 [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.
