<CONTACT>Christopher A. Weaver, Contracting Officer, Phone 301.827.5871, Email christopher.weaver@nih.gov
<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION:<br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-(AG)-PSOL-75N95019R00026 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a non-competitive basis to Johns Hopkins University, 3910 Keswick Road, Baltimore, MD 21211.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A solicitation document will not be issued, and proposals will not be requested. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statements or proposals received within this notice's response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION AUTHORITY:<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, specifically the results of market research concluded no other source of supply or service has the capability to provide the required services.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The goal of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology (LMBI) is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of processes that contribute to age-associated changes in physiology, including diseases whose prevalence increases with age. Our research has three interconnected themes: 1) molecular mechanisms of basic cellular processes, 2) immune cell function, and 3) translating basic mechanisms to clinical research.</p>
<p>Major areas of emphasis include: 1) elucidation of molecular mechanisms that govern tissue-specific gene expression; 2) molecular mechanisms of antibody diversity, 3) mechanisms controlling T cell memory, and 4) contribution of regulatory immune cells to cancer. As described below for the individual programs, a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo models are employed to approach these issues. These processes have direct relevance to our understanding of critical events associated with various age-related deficits and/or development of age-related diseases including cancer. LMBI investigators also study several aspects of human immunology. These areas of research include: 1) functional changes in immune cell types that occur with age and their contribution to chronic inflammation; 2) properties of age-associated immune subsets and 3) the emergence of autoimmunity in the elderly.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br />The purpose of this requirement is for the Characterization of Human Arterial Immunoglobulin Repertoire (CHAIR), or more specifically to acquire arterial and peripheral B cells that will be analyzed to assess whether chronic inflammation during atherosclerosis drives the generation and activation of specific antibody clones. This acquisition is specifically for the isolation and collection of arterial tissue during surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br />A cardiologist will be required to coordinate the acquisition of arterial tissue during vascular surgery performed at local hospitals. As a medical doctor, the cardiologist will have access to participants' records to identify the ideal subjects. The cardiologist will provide guidance on medically relevant and irrelevant data which will assist in the correct correlations being made between our immune cell findings and clinical disease.</p>
<p>A vascular surgeon will be required to perform the tissue isolation. As the attending surgeon, the vascular surgeon will present the research study to the participants, confirm that they meet the inclusion criteria, and coordinate with the NIA researchers when the surgeries will take place. During the procedure, the vascular surgeon will isolate tissue relevant to the research study in conjunction with the NIA researcher present in the operating room, place the tissue in 1x PBS storage container, and provide peripheral blood to NIA researchers.</p>
<p>The NIA investigators will be responsible for arriving in the operating room prior to the tissue extraction, confirming participant consent to take tissue, provide tissue collection containers, and retrieve the tissue from the vascular surgeon during the operation. This tissue will then be transported to NIA for experimental analysis.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />12-months from date of award.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:<br />(1) The Government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 6.302-1 and (2) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 621111 with a size standard of $11.0 million.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES:<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY:<br />No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

Are there any accessories for any equipment item that are normally separately priced?  What accessories?
Are there any items that you would recommend be purchased separately? What items and why?
Is there any reason you would not be interested in responding to a solicitation? What are the reason(s) and why?

SET-ASIDE

Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.

AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.  This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers.  No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.
 
Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM.  All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract.  Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.   Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any vendor interested in this requirement shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer or distributor for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and services are provided and maintained by the OEM or that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment on their behalf.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment.  To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured.  This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  

An EXAMPLE of an acceptable OEM Authorized Dealer letter is attached (SEE ATTACHMENT 1).

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1 For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($250K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C260-19-AP-0510

Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN20, Portland VA Medical Center 2237: 648-19-2-093-1749

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount: Emergency request for Nanosphere Verigene Blood Culture Test Kits and Consumables. Estimated amount: $54,666.00

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:
This is a Portland laboratory emergency request for Blood Gram Culture Test Kits. The existing contract will expire 1/7/2019 and is a critical need to patient care. A continuity of a contract is required as to not lose service for the laboratory. A delay could result in a risk to patient care, increased risk to staff, and increased risk to patients due to the potential of erroneous test results. This is a compelling and urgent requirement to have the Portland Laboratory remain operational. A requirement to solicit and award to another vendor would be delay patient care due to technical evaluation and replacing current equipment that utilizes these proprietary consumables.


Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted: Market research was conducted but due to the urgent and compelling need we will stay with the current test kit company for familiarity. The market research explains the life threatening results if these tests are not completed in a timely manner.


Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Professional Sports Publications. The media company will place a full-page ad (designed and produced in-house by CDC), to provide an opportunity to promote a cancer prevention message that garners literally millions of impressions. As the official program for the Super Bowl, the print version is considered a souvenir/collectors' item and is shared and saved longer than a normal print venue. In addition, the online version runs live longer than the Super Bowl event itself, helping to promote DCPC messages of cancer prevention and control to a larger than normal audience. Professional Sports Publications have exclusive licensing agreements and proprietary data. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within four (4) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at vwa8@cdc.gov by COB 3, January 2018.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) and constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-100. This combined synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a cascading small business set-aside. If no acceptable Small Business quotes are received, then other than Small Business responses will be considered. North American Industrial Classification Standard 238330 applies to this solicitation; business size standard is $15m.
<p>The Minnesota Air National Guard has a requirement for raised flooring in a new flight simulator facility to support equipment cable routing below the raised floor. See specification document.</p>
<p>*Please read this solicitation carefully*</p>
<p>Situation: Currently the 148FW is remodeling a site via an existing Construction Contractor (CC) which will eventually house specialized flight simulator equipment. Each step in the process is time sensitive. The area will be ready for flooring installation between February and June (exact timing to be determined), at which time the awardee of this solicitation (Flooring Contractor, FC) will be ready to install raised flooring in the area. The FC shall initially install the raised floor throughout the facility per the design spec, except in the vicinity of the exterior entry door where there shall be an uninterrupted level surface across the entire width of the exterior entry door. This area requires a temporary infill of the area that will ultimately be the fire-egress ramp, and this portion of the project will be referred to as "the temporary ramp infill." This temporary ramp infill requirement is necessary to create a wide "loading-dock" style area sufficient to allow a 3rd party Equipment Contractor (EC) to utilize the entire width of the exterior door to unload and stage equipment. The exact configuration of the temporary ramp infill in this area shall be such that the temporary floor surface matches the finished elevation of the rest of the raised floor, allows for the unimpeded use of pallet-jacks across any transitions, be of equal or greater load bearing capacity to the rest of the raised floor, be constructed so as to allow for removal after the 3rd party EC is finished, and be of a design and material to be proposed by the FC. The installation of the raised floor throughout the facility, and the temporary ramp infill near the exterior door, shall be referred to as "Phase 1" of the project. After Phase 1 of the project is complete, the FC will be allowed to depart the site. Phase 2 is the period of time during which the 3rd party EC will be installing flight simulator equipment throughout the facility; Phase 2 is not a part of this solicitation, and the FC is not expected to be present during Phase 2 of the project. Upon completion of Phase 2, the FC will be recalled to the project site to begin Phase 3. Phase 3 requires that the FC remove the temporary ramp infill, and proceed with any remaining steps to finish the fire-egress ramp portion of the floor, as well as install any required railings at the perimeter of the ramp. Once the temporary ramp infill has been removed, and all portions of the raised floor and egress ramp are determined to be complete (per design spec,) then Phase 3 will be complete (completing the contract resulting from this solicitation). Note that the FC will be responsible for removing any and all waste, to include the temporary ramp infill, from the project site prior to final completion.</p>
<p>Schedule of events:<br />1. Existing CC nears completion of area requiring flooring.<br />2. Government will contact FC with notice to proceed on Phase I and will provide dates which the area will become available.<br />3. CC finishes area. Government takes ownership.<br />4. Phase 1 work begins, FC immediately installs raised flooring and temporary ramp infill. <br />5. FC notifies government that Phase 1 is complete. <br />6. Phase 2 begins; EC will import and set up the simulator equipment inside the area.<br />7. Upon EC completion, Government will give FC a notice to proceed on Phase 3.<br />8. Phase 3 begins; FC will remove the temporary ramp infill, install/finish the fire-egress ramp and associated railings to complete this contract.</p>
<p>Specifications: Any deviation from the listed specifications must be approved by the Contracting Officer for quote to remain eligible for consideration. If a specification is too restrictive, please make the Contracting Officer aware as soon as possible. The specifications are not absolute, but the weight tolerances need to be sufficient to support the equipment which will be installed in the room. This is a major technical consideration. Any quote which the government receives will be considered to have the specifications releasable to the simulator equipment installation vendor.</p>
<p>This flooring requirement is being procured as flooring equipment with installation. Please contact Contracting Officer if you would like to schedule a site visit, although site visits might not be practical as the site is not constructed as of yet.</p>
<p>Be sure to submit/attach enough additional information to enable the Government to fully ascertain the specifications/capabilities of any products quoted.</p>
<p>Preparing and Submitting your Quote:<br />Response is encouraged to include past performance information: other military, commercial, and civilian companies with whom you have done business. Include country of manufacture for all items. Include feasible delivery dates.</p>
<p>Preferred CLIN structure:<br />CLIN0001: Phase 1, 1 EA<br />CLIN0002: Phase 3, 1 EA<br />CLIN0003: Manpower Reporting, 1 JB (see Manpower Reporting section)</p>
<p>All questions and quotes must be directed to 148 Contracting Officer via email at usaf.mn.148-fw.list.msc-personnel@mail.mil. Questions asked within 1 week of solicitation close will be answered at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Please make quotes good for 30 days, if possible. Emailed quotes are preferred. Late quotes may be rejected at the Contracting Officer's discretion.</p>
<p>Evaluation: <br />The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offer conforming to the solicitation which will be most advantageous to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated using price, technical, delivery (this is a time sensitive process.), and past performance. All solicitation specifications are not absolute and the 148FW will consider innovative solutions to this requirement. Quotes may be comparatively evaluated in compliance with FAR 13.106-2 (b) (3). Only the winning specifications will be shared with the third party equipment installation vendor, and this vendor will not participate in the evaluation. If the winning specifications are rejected by the equipment installer, the government reserves the right to either re-solicit or if changes are minor, work with the awardee to modify their quote.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE ONE (1) CONTRACT BUT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONSIDER PARTIAL OR MULTIPLE AWARDS. If not already registered in SAM, go to WWW.SAM.GOV to register prior to submitting quote. At the time of evaluation of your quote, your company much have an active status in SAM.gov.</p>
<p>Electronic Documents: All electronic documents must NOT be "secured", "locked", or otherwise inaccessible. Submitter risks rejection if documents prove inhospitable to viewing and evaluation. Utilize standard Microsoft or Adobe formats, and net file size of all documents should be less than 10MB.</p>
<p>If an individual item of supply is valued over $5,000, contractor must comply with 252.211-7003 Item Unique Identification and Valuation. VIN, MEID, ESN, GIAI, and GRAI are considered equivalent of a UID.</p>

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

Statement of Work:
Background:
The equipment must be compatible with:  
DSSRV Pelco NVR
Digital recorder 18TB PE-DSSRV180U    QTY: 3
Dell i7 server PC XPS tower                     QTY: 1   
System installation and manufacturer warranty on parts and labor for are to be included with this requirement. 
Replacement DVR system is required to integrate into existing CCTV system, supporting all current functions and supporting all cameras and peripherals, with ability to add additional camera system in the future.
Delivery:  
Delivery accepted at VAMC Wilkes Barre, Warehouse, 1111 East End Blvd, Wilkes Barre, PA 18711; Weekdays 8:00am   4:00pm, excluding any government holidays.  Police Service.

Product Features
Increased data rate of up to 350 Mbps (RAID) or 300 Mbps (JBOD) total throughput, allowing the server to support more users and play back more cameras simultaneously than previous DSSRV models
4TB storage drives provide 33% more storage over DSSRV 3TB models at no additional cost; systems previously utilizing two or more servers can now be built on a single server
SSD system drive, with increased read-write speeds and no moving parts, increases overall system responsiveness and reliability
Supports up to 128 IP Camera Streams; up to 64 Analog Cameras*
Records H.264, MJPEG, and MPEG-4 IP Streams
Supports Pelco and Third-Party IP Cameras and Network Encoders
Compatible with DS ControlPoint for Simultaneous Monitoring of All DS Series and DX Series Products in a Single Client Interface
Optimized For Video Surveillance
The DigitalSentryNetworkVideoRecorder (DSSRV2NVR) is optimized by Pelco to deliver the essential hardware support for the DS NVs video management software (VMS) without the extra cost or risk of integrating hardware and software.
Boosted by the 4th Generation Intel Xeon  processor and 8 GB of RAM, DSSRV2 NVR provides an optimal combination of processing power and reliability to meet the demands of HD video recording and playback operations. The system is powered to support up to 128 combined IP and analog video streams, with up to 64 analog cameras supported via the optional ENC5516 direct-attached encoder. Analog streams are also supported using Pelco and third-party encoders.
The DSSRV2 NVR boasts total throughput of up to 350 Mbps (300 Mbps for JBOD models) for recording analog and IP video streams as well as playback and export through the DS ControlPoint client. The increased data rate over original DSSRV models allows more users to play back video from the server simultaneously. When determining the maximum number of cameras and the desired frame rate to host on each system, the number of concurrent client connections, the number of streams played back per client, and the bandwidth required for client connections must be considered.
The DSSRV2 NVR functions as a stand-alone system or as part of a network of servers, monitored from the DS Control Point user interface. The system can be deployed solely as a network video recorder, as a digital video recorder (DVR), or as a hybrid NVR.
Two gigabit network ports provide for convenient network architecture planning by allowing one port to be dedicated to IP cameras, while the second network port is used for client connections. Two DVI-D ports provide a convenient connection for high resolution digital monitors for use with HD cameras.


Network Health and Event Monitoring Support Through SNMP and New Digital Sentry System Information (DSSI) Utility
Compatible with the DS Archive Utility
Recording Rate Configurable per Individual Camera
Reliability
DSSRV2 models incorporate an SSD system drive. With increased read-write speeds and no moving parts, the SSD system drive increases the reliability, uptime, and responsiveness of the system. DSSRV2 systems now support 4TB drives, increasing capacity by 33% over original DSSRV models without increasing cost. With front-available storage drives for easy servicing and upgrades, the DSSRV2 NVR is available with up to 20 TB storage for models without the optional optical disk drive (ODD), or up to 16 TB for ODD models. The drives are hot-swappable when configured for internal RAID 5 storage.
External storage is supported through USB attached storage or by using the optional DSSRV-SCSI interface card to connect to external SCSI storage targets such as the DX8100HDDI, providing additional storage of up to 24 TB. The external storage can be configured for either JBOD storage or for software controlled RAID 5 storage.
Front panel LED displays on the DSSRV2 NVR provide information on system operation. The LEDs are integrated with the new Digital Sentry System Information (DSSI) utility, providing critical, real-time statistics on system resource utilization, temperature, and throughput status.
*The DS NVs database is limited to 128 cameras. The actual number of cameras the server supports depends on camera settings, client activity, network bandwidth, and the available throughput of the DSSRV2.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Open Architecture
The cornerstone of Digital Sentry design, a fully Open Architecture, is provided through ONVIF compliance and support for a large number of IP-specific drivers. Users can choose specific IP cameras or encoders to fit their application.
In addition, the Digital Sentry platform supports the Pelco API and a full suite of integration tools, allowing Digital Sentry to be integrated into access control or physical security information management (PSIM) systems.

IMPORTANT NOTE. PLEASE READ. The network implementation is shown as a general representation only and is not intended to show a detailed network topology. Your actual network will differ, requiring changes or perhaps additional network equipment to accommodate the system as illustrated. Please contact your local Pelco representative to discuss your specific requirements.
Eliminate the risk of deferred support that comes with VMS software from one vendor and a general-purpose hardware platform from another. Replace it with the assurance of an integrated platform built specifically for the rigors of IP video recording. Make the performance, reliability, and Open Architecture of DS NVs running on DSSRV2 NVR the core foundation of your video management solution.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

PERFORMANCE BASED WORK STATEMENT
Licensed Clinical Psychologist, certified by the motivational interviewing (MI) network of trainers and trained in motivational interviewing assessment (MIA) to train and certify staff members in motivational interviewing assessment. 
BACKGROUND 
The VISN 17 Center of Excellence (COE) for Research on Returning War Veterans in Waco, Texas, was designated in 2006. Congress instructed the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to designate the Waco campus as a Center of Excellence to focus on mental health/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) needs. The COE will allow the VA to consolidate personnel, training, and specialized resources in an efficient manner to improve knowledge related to treatment, prevention, rehabilitation, and clinical services to our nation s veterans, with focus on those veterans returning from Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF). 
The primary mission of the VISN 17 Center of Excellence (COE) is to (1) develop, implement, and disseminate research into the causes of PTSD and its effects on combat veterans and their significant others; and (2) provide education for health care specialists and administrators around improved methods of diagnosing and treating individuals with mental health problems, especially veterans. The COE serves as a major source of expertise on the mental health consequences of war to legislative bodies such as Congress, and it serves as an internationally visible focus of research activity on the psychological problems of combat veterans. Administratively, the COE consortium is under the direct control of the Office of Mental Health Services at VA Central Office.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>The Africa Regional Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, D.C.

<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in the Sub-Saharan Africa regions, supervising program teams in Washington, D.C. and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>

<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Asia Regional Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: West Africa (AFR), Latin America, the Caribbean and East Africa (LACSEA), Asia, Middle East (ME), and Europe (EUR). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in Asia, supervising program teams in Washington, D.C. and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/211_2.htm#211.274"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: windowtext; text-underline: none">211.274</span></a> of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor. </span></p>

FACILITIES

Q1: Will the VA be soliciting for 3rd party inspections during construction or is that the responsibility of the awarded GC?
A1: Revise specification section 01 45 29 item 1.1 to read,  A. This section specifies materials testing activities and inspection services required during project construction to be provided by a Testing Laboratory retained by the General Contractor. 
Q2: I see that a Geotechnical Report was prepared by Urban Engineers, Inc. in November 2013. Is this report available for review?
A2: Report attached.
Q4: Are reinforcing steel cages for the caissons partial depth or full length? Please refer to Section 1 on drawing SB501 where it appears that the cages are not full length but further details do not provide any additional information.
A4: The rebar is to be 40 feet long.
Q5: Are there approved vendors for the fire alarm, security and communications.
A5: The services of Tri-M must be used for integration into the existing security systems. The services of BFPE must be used for integration into the existing Notifier fire alarm system.
Q6: Have any other geotechnical reports been completed in this area?
A6: See additional report prepared by Duffield Associates from 2010.
Q7: Are there any required manufacturer's or a basis for design for the following items; sump pump, floor drains, wall hydrants or hose bibs, or is the intention to use whatever meets the specifications?
A7: Contractor required to meet the requirements of the contract documents. Please refer to the attachment for the basis of design for floor drains, it is critical that this type of floor drains should be used in the garage which is designed for vehicular traffic loads.
Q8: Please clarify your intent for the deduction of "one parking level".  Does the partial fourth level get removed or does a lower full level get deleted?   If the intent is to remove a full lower level, then are we to assume that you simply intend to remove "one layer of the cake" so to speak, and that the partial fourth level, as designed, would move down one level?   In removing one level does the capacity for the elevators to travel this additional vertical distance likewise get reduced?
A8: The intent for the alternate is to remove one typical level of the garage, i.e., the level just below the top tier of the garage. The remainder of the garage shall remain as is per design. Note that the entire structure was designed for two levels of future expansion regardless of this alternate. Such design shall remain as is and no reduction of the garage load-bearing capacity shall be done due to this alternate.


Q9: Drawing states 1.5# pcy synthetic fiber but page 11 of Cast in Place shows steel fibers at 30# pcy. Please advise.

A9: 1.5 lbs per cubic yard of concrete is what we specified for the slab-on-grade and cast-in-place topping and washes.
Q10: Drawing SB-101 shows a drilled pier labeled DP42 near S.E. corner.  SB-002 does not list a DP42 on the drilled pier/caisson schedule.  .
A10: Here is the missing information:
 Mark: DP42
 Pier Size: 3    6 
 Type: A
 Vertical: 8 - #9
 Ties: #4 @ 9 O.C

Q11: Are reinforcing steel cages for the caissons partial depth or full length? Please refer to Section 1 on drawing SB501 where it appears that the cages are not full length but further details do not provide any additional information.
A11: The rebar is to be 40 feet long.
Q11: Clarification on the caisson compressive strength - the plan calls for 3000psi, however, the specs call for 5000psi.  Which governs?  
A11: 3000psi.
Q12: The drawings call for Drilled Piers to be filled with concrete with a 3000 lb comprehensive strength. The drilled caisson specification calls for concrete with a comprehensive strength of 5000 psi. Please advise.
A12: 3000psi.
Q13: Reference the SF1442. In Block 10 is states that  This contract is for 365 days; 95 Days for submittals and administrative matters and 270 Days mobilized on site.   Will the contractor be allowed to mobilize and start Phase 1 work earlier than 95 days after NTP?  Considering this is a phased project and temporary parking has to be constructed prior to starting the deck construction, and then demolished at the end of the project, we do not feel like 270 days is ample time to perform this work.
A13: Revise contract duration to 455 calendar days with the stipulation that only 270 calendar days are permitted during which the Contractor has unrestricted use of the west lot. Intent is to limit Facility parking impact to 270 days. Phase 1 work may begin immediately following NTP.




Q14: Reference part 1.23 SECURITY BADGES/BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS of section INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS TO BIDDERS/OFFERORS.  Will this level of security badging be required for this particular project considering it is a parking garage and is contained outside of the main facility?
A14: Security badging will not be required for this contract for work taking place outside of the Facility for temporary parking or parking deck construction. Site Superintendent to keep a logbook of individuals working on site on a daily basis. Individuals working inside the Facility to complete tie-ins (electrical, security, fire alarm, etc.) will be required to obtain a badge.
Q15: Reference Contract Drawing CD101 and Demolition Key Note #14. We understand that there is an unknown utility line noted and it is clear that we are to verify the utility line and coordinate with the COR the removal of the noted line. For pricing purposes can the VA provide a standard description for the unknown utility line and the extent of the demolition required? Recommendation: We would recommend that the VA define the unknown utility line as an irrigation line, underground conduit, underground ductbank, direct burial site lighting cabling, water main, storm sewer line, sanitary sewer line, etc., and to remove and cap the utility line 5 foot outside the construction site. This will allow all contractors to price the same work scope for the project.
A15: Assume unknown utility is site lighting conduit. Contractor to verify, remove, and cap utility 5  outside of garage footprint.
Q16: Reference Contract Drawing CU101 and Utility Key Note #2. We understand that the drawing notes the installation of a new 1  PVC water main for service to the parking garage. Specification Sections 22 11 00, paragraph 2.2.B. and 33 10 00, paragraph 3.5 outlines the requirement for Type K copper for the service line from the building to 5 ft outside the footprint of the building. Please clarify if PVC is acceptable or to follow the specifications for using Type K copper to just outside the building and then transition to PVC. 
A16: Provide copper piping per the specifications.
Q17: Reference Contract Drawings CU101, E601, and Specification Sections 26 13 16 and 26 12 19. The civil drawing shows a pad for the pad mounted medium voltage transformer along with the single line electrical drawing. Specification Section 26 13 16 outlines the requirement for a medium voltage fusible deadfront air break switch with external operating handle with padlocking provisions. Specification Section 26 12 19 specifies a medium voltage pad mounted transformer with an oil-immersed internal medium voltage switch with primary fuse assembly. Recommendation: We would recommend deleting the specified medium voltage deadfront air break switch since the standard oil immersed medium voltage switch and primary fuses will provide all the necessary switching and protection required for a parking garage and will provide adequate service life and will provide a cost savings to the VA. 
A17: Disregard spec 26 13 16. Provide internal MV switch and primary fuse assembly with oil filled transformer.



Q18: Reference Contract Drawing EP101, Security Note 1. We understand that the new electronic safety and security systems installed in the garage shall be compatible with the existing systems currently installed and shall tie-into the existing systems and that the headend equipment is located in Building 1, Room 155. Please provide information (manufacture, model number, & point of contact info   name, phone, & email) on the existing systems currently installed at the VAMC, i.e., (a) fire alarm system, (b) emergency call system, (c) CCTV (security cameras) system, (d) access control system, (e) direct digital control (DDC & ECC) system, (f) telephone system (VOIP?), and (g) network switch(s) (fiber & cat)
A18: Fire alarm vendor for existing Notifier system is BFPE: 155 Commerce Way, Ste A Dover, DE 19904, (302) 527-2373.
Emergency call system, CCTV, and access control is Lenel. Our designated VAR is Tri-M: 206 Gale Lane, Kennett Square, PA 19348, 1-800-456-7782.
DDC integration to be performed by Modern Controls, 7 Bellecor Dr. New Castle, DE 19720, (302) 325-6800.
There is no prescribed vendor for phone and network services.
Q19: Reference Contract Drawing EP101, Security Note 2. Please provide the necessary information on the VA Security VAR for the security systems along with a point of contact (name, phone number, and email) for the systems.
A19: VA security VAR is Tri-M. POC is Rob Koenig, 610-444-1002, RKoenig@tri-mgroup.com
Q20: Reference Contract Drawing EP101, General Sheet Note 6. Please provide information (manufacture, model number, point of contact info  name, phone & email) for the existing emergency phones currently installed.
A20: See attached cut sheets from Code Blue.
Q21: Reference Contract Drawing EP101, PL101, and PL301, detail 2, Sump Pump Detail, and Specification Section 22 14 29, paragraph 2.1 A   I. The power plan details a waterproof receptacle (circuit EPR 11) to feed the sump pump. Specification section 22 14 29 outlines a very detailed sump pump control panel with two separate power sources to feed the sump controller and the alarm panel. In addition, it outlines a requirement for interfacing the controller to the building automation system. Please clarify the following points: (a) only one (1) sump pump required for the two elevator shafts, (b) location for alarm panel, horn, strobe light, silencing switch, etc., (c) requirements for interfacing to the DDC Control System and Monitoring Points for the DDC/ECC system. (d) Specifications and Sequence of Operation for the Control Panel for the oil detection probes. Recommendation: We would recommend a local alarm panel with strobe and/or horn to alert the VA to an issue with the sump pump and keep it simple verses a very detailed and expensive customize control panel with interface to the DDC system. We would also recommend that the VA consider installing a oil/water separator on the sump pump since the drawings detail discharging to the storm sewer system.  
A21: Specifications and sump details are calling for a simple package sump pump system similar to Stancor SE50 Oil Minder elevator system with contacts for remote signaling for maintenance personnel.

Q22: Reference Contract Drawing E501, Detail 8 (CCTV Riser Diagram), Detail 14 (Emergency Call Box Riser Diagram), Contract Drawing E504, single line flow diagraphs for CCTV System, Cabling Schedule, Equipment, Keynotes for Security Flow riser, and Specification Sections 28 23 00, and 28 26 00. The contract drawings indicate that this project involves the expansion of the existing CCTV (video surveillance) system along with the typical integration of the new cameras into the existing monitoring and control systems along with expansion of the emergency call box system. Specification Section 28 23 00, paragraph 1.5, Submittals, outlines specific design package submissions for the proposed system design with two noted reviews (four is noted in the text but two (2) are specifically noted) at the 65% and 100%. The specifications also note the submission of a system readiness checklist and a commissioning per Specification Section 28 08 00 (which is not included with the current specification sections). The specifications (28 23 00   2.3) outlines specific control equipment for the system. Specification Section 28 26 00 (Electronic Personal Protection System) also outlines specific design submissions for the emergency phone system at the 35%, 65%, 90% and 100% pre-installation design phase. We understand that the project includes the expansion of the CCTV and Emergency Call Box Systems and that we have to interface the new equipment into the existing systems, but the specification sections have not be edited to reflect just an expansion of the existing systems. It would be helpful if the following issues can be confirmed:
The project includes the expansion of the CCTV (security camera system) system as shown on the contract drawings and includes the necessary equipment (as scheduled), cabling (as scheduled), power supplies, and integration into the existing systems to provide video coverage of the parking garage as shown and detailed on the contract drawings. The new system shall be integrated into the existing monitoring, recording, and control stations as required to maintain system performance and as detailed on the security flow riser diagram. 
This is correct.
The installation of the CCTV system shall be by an authorized manufacturer s representative or by the current company which is maintaining and updating the current system (please confirm that this is acceptable). 
This is correct.
The project includes the expansion of the emergency call box system as shown on the contract drawings and includes the matching the existing equipment, and installation of the cabling, new security panels (as required), power supplies, and interfacing with the existing emergency call system located in Building #1, Room 155. The new installation will include updating the existing as-built security directories and adding the new identifiers for the added emergency call box(s). 
This is correct.
Q23: Reference Contract Drawings EP101   EP104, E502, Detail 1, Fire Alarm Riser, and Specification Section 28 31 00, Fire Detection and Alarm. The contract drawings indicate a conventional horn and strobe system with heat detectors and manual pull stations and fireman s phone jacks. The specifications note a digital voice fire alarm system with manual voice override for notifying occupants (paragraph 1.1   Description).  Please clarify the following items:
Fire alarm system shall be designed with conventional horn and ADA compliant strobes with adjustable candela output. 
This is correct.
Fire alarm system shall provide remote transmission of trouble and alarm conditions to the main fire alarm panel in Building 1. 
This is correct.
Advise if the facility uses a base loop system or a networked system, see riser drawing note for Campus FA Loop on riser diagram (E502). 
Networked system is existing.
Please provide information on the existing fire alarm panel, i.e., manufacture, model number, and point of contract (name, phone number and email). 
Existing system is Honeywell Notifier. Existing system is maintained by BFPE: 155 Commerce Way, Ste A Dover, DE 19904, (302) 527-2373.

Q24: Reference Contract Drawings E503, Security Door Control Description schedule, Door Details 2, 3, & 4, E504, Security Flow Riser Diagram, and Specification Sections 28 13 00, Physical Access Control Systems, 28 13 16, Access Control System and Database Management. The contract drawings indicate that this project involves the expansion of the existing access control system as detailed on the security flow riser and floor plans along with the security door control schedule descriptions. Specification Section 28 13 00, paragraph 1.4, Submittals has a very detailed submission requirement for submitting system design packages for the 35%, 65%, 90%, & 100% design phase for the project. The specifications also describe the requirements for various rooms, operator console for the system, power requirements, door schedules, cameras, intercom, system configuration, system functionality, software, training manuals, training, O&M manuals, FIPS compliance certificates for system components and software, etc. The specifications provide a very detailed outline for a completely new access control system and not just the expansion of the existing system. Specification Section 28 13 16 describes the installation of a complete Physical Access Control System and Database Management Software for the project. It outlines the specific system requirements for integration and submission of various design packages at the 35%, 65%, 90% & 100% design phases for the pre-installation phase of the project. It outlines the database requirements and FIPS compliance for the system and a specific set of requirements for the system as a whole. We understand the project includes the expansion of the existing access control system as detailed on the contract drawings. Please clarify the following:

Project requires the expansion of the access control system as detailed on the contract drawings. 
This is correct.

The system components, submittals, shop drawings, and installation and testing shall be by a factory authorized company which specializes in the installation, programming for the system. 
This is correct.
Card readers and system components shall match existing system components.
This is correct.
Existing system shall be programmed, and graphics modified to incorporate the added system components, i.e., additional security doors, cameras, emergency phones, etc. 
This is correct.
Please provide information on the existing access control system (Lenel On Guard   please confirm) and a point of contact for the current vendor (name, phone, and email) that supports the existing system.
 VA security VAR is Tri-M. POC is Rob Koenig, 610-444-1002, RKoenig@tri-mgroup.com

Q25: Reference Specification Section 01 35 26, Paragraph 1.12.B. This section notes that the primary project scope area is a Class IV Risk Class for Infection Control. I believe this is in error and it should be noted as a Class I. Please clarify the Infection Control Risk Classification for the project.

A25: Project is a Class I risk for infection control.

Q26: Reference Specification Section 01 32 16.15, Project Schedule. The specifications outline a very detailed Critical Path Method for developing the project schedule using scheduling consultant. We have found that this type of scheduling is important on complex construction projects, i.e., healthcare and occupied multi-phased projects but we believe for a parking garage that most qualified general contractors can develop and manage an effective CPM schedule which provides the information required in the specifications. Please advise if a contractor developed CPM Schedule would be acceptable or if we need to use a third-party CPM Scheduling Consultant.

A26: A contractor developed CPM schedule is acceptable.

Q27: Reference Specification Section 14 24 00, Hydraulic Elevators.  Would a MRL (machine roomless) electric traction elevator be acceptable?

A27: No. VA Central Office does not permit installation of MRL elevators.

<DESC><strong>Additional Information on Existing Site/Trailer:&nbsp; </strong>The existing trailer is located on the east side of Highway 281. The existing location presents a safety hazard to the employees because it requires crossing the highway to perform the on-load inspections on the west side of Highway 281. A primary goal of the project is to relocate the existing trailer from the east side of the highway to the west side of the highway to eliminate the pedestrian traffic and safety concerns. The work will also include the construction of an inspection platform constructed the length of a semi-trailer, approximately 50 feet.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The existing trailer is a double wide trailer that has a concrete pad with the structure sitting on cinder blocks. The inside of the trailer is tiled with plumbing, electrical, and mechanical hook ups. Please be advised that the description provided herein is for informational purposes only, and it is ultimately up to offerors to inspect the existing site conditions if a solicitation is released for this requirement.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Photos have been attached to give interested offerors a limited illustration of the existing site and trailer.</div>
