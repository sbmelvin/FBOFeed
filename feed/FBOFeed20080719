Project Description: 

Please Note:  The description provided herein is a summary of anticipated product and services and is not intended to be all-inclusive.
 
This is a FY 2009 action. The primary objective of the Government’s requirement will encompass focusing on procuring an electronic tax preparation and transmission software and support. This software will support the IRS organizations’ tax assistance programs, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), IRS Employees (Employee e-file), and Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC).  Support shall include software maintenance; help desk assistance, classroom, web-based, and web-site operation training; receipt and processing of transmissions from licensees to contractor and from contractor to IRS; return of acknowledgement files to IRS licensees; and management reports.

The IRS requires both desktop and web-based Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic tax preparation and transmission software and support, compliant with IRS electronic e-file and security requirements. Both the desktop and web-based software will be used by the IRS tax assistance programs listed above, to provide free electronic federal and state tax return preparation and transmission for taxpayers. The software is expected to be used by tax professionals and non-tax professionals, who are IRS partners, volunteers, and employees.

IRS further anticipates the award of a contract for a one year base period and four one-year option periods.  

Effective June 25, 2001, the Federal government implemented Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. § 794(d)).
