This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Regarding items #6-8, the design of these parts is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes.

On-site work will occur between approximately November 2017 and September 2018.  Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals.  A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
PROJECT LOCATION:    The building is located in Vancouver, WA 98661.  Maps and information are at www.nps.gov/FOVA.       
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held on October 11, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation.  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory).  Requests for individual site visits will not be honored.
DETAILS:  This is a best value negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $36.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act.  The contractor will have 300 calendar days to complete the project after the Notice to Proceed is issued.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $1,000,000 and $2,500,000.  
The RFP and future amendments will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately September 20, 2017.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days thereafter, unless extended.  The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.  The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value.
Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.  Prospective offerors will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no other notifications will be sent.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.  The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List where you can add your company's interest.  Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not established and/or maintained an active registration at www.SAM.gov prior to the offer due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.
