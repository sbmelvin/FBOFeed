<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) - New Jersey, on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 10, 2013 for the manufacturing, inspection, testing, and delivery of the FMU-160 A/B HIGH FRAGMENTATION (HFF) PROXIMITY FUZE, with POINT DETONATING (PD) backup.  The program satisfies the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) requirements for fiscal years 2013-2017, for AC-130 Gunship training and tactical missions.   <br>   <br> The FMU-160A/B Fuze is a radio frequency HF proximity fuze with a PD backup. The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 332993 and the FSC code is 1390.  The NSN for the FMU-153 A/B PD/DLY Fuze is 1390-01-616-7163.  The FMU-160 A/B Fuze is used to detonate the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF) High Explosive (HE) Projectile Gun Unit (PGU) 45/B Cartridge.  The PGU-45/B is an asset on the AC-130 Gunship, and is fired out of a modified 105mm Howitzer.  The FMU-160 A/B is set to provide a 15-foot height of burst.  The height of burst optimizes the lethality of the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF), High Explosive (HE), PGU-45/B Cartridge.  <br>  <br> Competition for this requirement will be restricted under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (3), and FAR 6.302-3 (a)(2)(i), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or Expert Services, from companies within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) in order to maintain or create the required domestic capability within the U.S., its outlying areas, and Canada.  Under the authority, the contract will require that the contractor obtain the FMU-160 A/B Fuze assembly, and the detonator and explosive train (to include the explosives themselves) from within the NTIB.  The balance of FMU-160 A/B Fuze sub-assemblies and sub-components are unrestricted.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The effort will result in award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract consisting of 5 one-year ordering periods, with priced ordering ranges.  The estimated maximum contract value will be $22,250,000 with a minimum guarantee of $700,000.     Each ordering period will consist of the following ordering ranges:  500-2,000; 2,001-5,000; 5,001-20,000.   <br>  <br> The technical data package is Distribution  quote mark D quote mark - approved for release to Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors.  The requirement will be solicited/manufactured against a Performance Specification.  The requirement will require the contractor to work with explosives.  Any request by DoD Contractors for Distribution Level  quote mark D quote mark  data shall be accompanied by the following:  a fully executed DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement, and a completed AMSTA-AR 1350.

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publically for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be publically disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

OR
Electronic Submission to:  yvonne.demorest@va.gov.

The SF-330s are due on December 26, 2013 at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

The Carl Vinson VAMC, Dublin, Georgia, is seeking a qualified A/E firm to provide all Architectural and Engineering services necessary to provide site investigation, schematic design, design development, construction documents, preparation of bid documents, and construction period services for Project # 557-380 "Construct New Mental Health Facility".  The design must, at a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes (NFPA, JCAHO, UBC, and EPA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) publications (Master Construction Specifications, Construction Standards, etc.).
The project shall be designed to attempt to achieve an energy consumption level that is at least 30% below the level achieved under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 ( if life-cycle cost effective) using Appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 to document the energy savings achieved by the design.  Should a 30% reduction in energy consumption savings prove to be unattainable per life-cycle cost analysis, A/E shall evaluate alternative designs at 5% successive decrements in order to identify the most energy-efficient design that is life-cycle cost effective.

All drawings and specifications shall be submitted by A/E to VA on computer disc at the completion of the project.  Drawings shall be in AUTOCAD 2010 format, with an accompanying MS Word (ver. 2007) document that lists the drawing number and a description of the drawing's content in sufficient detail to identify it.  Each individual Specification shall be submitted as a single MS Word version 2007 formatted document.  In addition to the individual Specification submittals, an overall document that compiles all Specifications into one, single-spaced document is also required.  One additional disk containing electronic copies of all drawings in portable document format (.pdf) shall be submitted for the Contracting Officer's use.  Project shall be designed to meet the prescribed VA Construction Budget; estimated cost range of construction for project 557-380 is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00 with sufficient Deductions to achieve a 20% reduction from that Budget.  Should bids received come in over budget even after taking the Bid Deducts into account, it will be the A/E's responsibility to redesign the project to achieve the VA Construction Budget.  The A/E will be responsible for phasing recommendations, planning, consultation and visits, design  work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications for construction bidding, perform constructability reviews at each design review, accessibility for maintenance and operation of all systems, complete or update the statement of conditions compliance document, preparation of cost estimates, participate in the reconciliation of VA and A/E cost estimates, perform energy review and analysis and other requirements as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work.  The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).

Firms will be evaluated by the A/E Evaluation Board, scored, and ranked according to score.  The three (3) most qualified firms will be invited to interview with the selection board, and will again be numerically scored.  The firm with the highest score will be selected and asked to negotiate a fair and reasonable price.  Those firms that do not rank in the short list will be notified of their exclusion from further competition.  This requirement is being procured in accordance with The Brooks Act of 1972, Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.6 (FAR) and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6 (VAAR).

The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:

The twin shaft vessels are powered by two Colt-Pielstick 10 PC4.2 V 570 main diesel engines with a Power Take Off (PTO) generator, which derives power off of the reduction gear. Additional stand-alone port and starboard Ship Service Diesel Generator (SSDG) sets can also provide ship service power and/or provide electrical power to motorize the PTO for emergency propulsion.<br /><br />Remote control and monitoring of the ship propulsion system along with remote monitoring of the ship electrical power generation/distribution and auxiliary machinery are accomplished via the Central Control System (CCS). The Central Control System consists of three (3) major operating stations:<br /><br />1) Engine Room Console (ERC)<br />2) Local Propulsion Control Console (LCC)<br />3) Ship Control Console (SCC)<br /><br />There are two (2) basic designs used in the development of the CCS for the T-AO 187 Class ships. Twelve (12) were supplied by a single manufacturer (TANO) and three (3) were supplied as a combination of two manufacturers (TANO and General Electric). The two designs for the ERC consoles differ, although the functional operator interface and outward appearance of the consoles is similar between both designs. The one significant difference between the designs' distributed control network is that the installations supplied by TANO alone utilize fourteen (14) RTU interfaces within the Engine Room while the three (3) TANO-GE combined installations use seven (7) RTU interfaces.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to develop and provide a working, fully functional, single design, machinery control and monitoring technology refresh to the existing CCS. The requirement is for a base design with options for the manufacture and installation of the CCS aboard the T-AO vessels.&nbsp; The CCS shall include the consoles and associated machinery space RTUs applicable to all ships in the class, which will offer continued supportability over the next fifteen (15) years with minimal future upgrades other than nominal technology refresh. This upgrade will replicate existing capabilities and functionalities with minimal changes other than those required by latest ABS Steel Vessel Rules (SVR) and/or to achieve ACCU requirements.<br /><br />17) Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide<br />18) Set-aside Status: Total Small Business<br /><br />Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted when and if a solicitation is released.

Bridger's technique, known as frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) chirped heterodyne LADAR has several advantages that make it preferable to direct detect LADAR systems. These benefits include 1) extremely high sensitivity comparable to state-of-the-art Geiger mode LADAR systems, 2) the potential for much higher range resolutions while simultaneously using lower bandwidth, higher dynamic range detectors, 3) Doppler detection capabilities, and 4) the use of robust high average power telecom grade amplifiers.&nbsp; In summary, Bridger Photonics Incorporated is the only company that can provide the 3D data collection.FSC Code:&nbsp;&nbsp;AD24&nbsp;NAICS:&nbsp;&nbsp;541330 SBA Size Standard:&nbsp;$14.0M&nbsp; Delivery of items will be to the Naval Support Activity- Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.&nbsp; Point of Contact- Contract Specialist Sharon Hess, Code G3, NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Ave. Panama City, FL 32407-7018, Email: <a href="mailto:sharon.hess@navy.mil">sharon.hess@navy.mil</a>&nbsp; 850-234-4413.&nbsp; Award will be based on a fair and reasonable price and award will be made on or about Dec 20, 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have</p>
<p>been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally</p>
<p>such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) is responsible for contributing to the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing lead in all licensing and inspection activities associated with the operation of existing nuclear power reactors and research and test reactor. NRR conducts a broad range of regulatory activities in the four primary program areas of rulemaking, licensing, oversight, and incident response for commercial nuclear power reactors, and test and research reactors to protect the public health, safety, and the environment.</p>
<p>Division of Safety Systems (DSS) of NRR provides nuclear plant systems-related analysis to assess the regulatory and technical appropriateness of the changes to existing licenses (Technical Specification, TS) including amendments, exceptions and applications for new facilities or designs. This analysis focuses on plant safety-related (primary and secondary systems) and non-safety related systems (containment, ventilation and balance of plant), in-core and spent fuel pool performance of fuel, clad and fuel assembly, nuclear physics, and thermal hydraulic performance. DSS provides expertise for other related purposes such as specific safety issue resolution, specific inspections, and incident response. Also, DSS develops programs and guidelines to improve generic technical specifications and provides interpretations of technical specification requirements.</p>
<p>The aforementioned work activities are performed under the cognizance of five branches: the Reactor Systems Branch (SRXB), the Nuclear Performance and Code Review Branch (SNPB), the Balance-of-Plant Branch (SBPB), the Containment and Ventilation Branch (SCVB) and the Safety Issues Resolution Branch (SSIB). Specifically, SRXB is responsible for evaluating issues related to fuel, thermal hydraulics, emergency core cooling systems, loss-of-coolant accident analysis and mitigation, transient analysis and mitigation, stability, nuclear physics, nuclear criticality safety, methods and code review related to all of the above.</p>
<p>This contract will primarily focus on review of plant-specific licensing actions dealing with fuel, thermal hydraulics, emergency core cooling systems, loss-of-coolant accident analysis and mitigation, transient analysis and mitigation, stability, nuclear physics, and nuclear criticality safety.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations with Nuclear, Mechanical, or Reactor Engineers/Scientists with in-depth knowledge and extensive experience in the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Using nuclear and thermal hydraulic analysis codes and the ability to develop cross-section libraries for use in the analysis of reactor design concepts and to generate data under all operating conditions.</p>
<p>&bull; Nuclear engineering reactor design and the ability to perform calculations, analyses and studies of reactor fuel cycles, reactor dynamics and kinetics simulations of reactors, develop nuclear physics methods of nuclear power plant dynamics and thermal-hydraulics using thermal-hydraulic codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Nuclear and mechanical fuel design and fuel cycle modeling including nuclear criticality safety reviews. Including the depletion analysis necessary to generate isotopic number densities for modeling spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>&bull; Loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) analysis including knowledge of all phases of the accident and of modeling codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Non-LOCA transient analysis, coupled nuclear reactor kinetics and thermal hydraulics reactor physics methods.</p>
<p>&bull; Thermal hydraulics and/or nuclear physics code development pertaining to a nuclear reactor including theory and correlations and associated testing and experimental data for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis.</p>
<p>&bull; Nuclear reactor stability analysis in Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs).</p>
<p>&bull; All aspects of core and reflector facility design.</p>
<p>&bull; Analysis for neutronic and thermal hydraulic instabilities in BWRs including evaluation of methodologies used to detect and suppress reactor instabilities and for special events such as ATWS and ATWS instabilities.</p>
<p>The contractors should be technical experts in their field, with extensive nuclear experience in the areas of nuclear criticality safety, nuclear reactor stability, and nuclear and thermal-hydraulic code development and use. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge in their technical area in order to identify and resolve issues. The technical personnel should have the knowledge and experience with the applicable NRC's regulatory process, applicable code of federal regulations (CFR), the applicability of Regulatory Guide (RG), NRC technical report designation Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NUREGs), Generic Letters (GLs), Information Notices (INs), Regulatory Issue Summaries (RISs), Interim Staff Guidance (ISGs), and relevant industry standard to the extent sufficient that the process can be applied to the potential support tasks.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p><br />1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The 9th Contracting Squadron (9 CONS) at Beale Air Force Base (AFB), CA, in support of the 9th Civil Engineering Squadron (9 CES), seeks to identify potential interested sources and obtain information in regards to potential conveyance and treatment of wastewater from Beale Air Force Base to an off-base wastewater treatment facility. The objective of this effort would be the divestment of Air Force ownership and responsibility for wastewater treatment, through demolition of the existing Beale treatment plant and conveyance of Base wastewater from the point of demarcation to be determined to an off-base utility service provider's facility for an indefinite and ongoing period. All responsibility for providing and maintaining reliable utility service, including pump station(s) and pipeline construction, wastewater treatment, including such items as compliance with applicable permits, laws and regulations, maintenance and repair costs, major system renovations, upgrades, improvements, construction, equipment, supervision, manpower and overhead costs and any penalties from non-compliance would become the responsibility of the utility service provider(s). The Air Force would expect to compensate the utility service provider(s) based on a fair and equitable rate comparable to other existing or future similar customers preferably billed on an annual basis on the amount of wastewater conveyed and treated.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. It is intended that a future utility service agreement will ultimately reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating, maintain and treating the Base's wastewater. This request for information from interested parties is to gather information that will be useful in the preparation of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties should submit information that may be included in the RFP to assist in that process. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of potential Offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>OFFERORS SHOULD SEE THE ATTACHED SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND COMPLETE AND RETURN SECTIONS 6.0 AND 7.0 TO INDICATE INTEREST.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 335999. Contractors must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUB Zone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business) in their response. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I) is requesting information regarding emerging technologies to enable soldier's systems to utilize modern Human-Machine interfaces, many variations of which are already available in the commercial/gaming market. Current keyboard and mouse input are not suitable when soldiers are forced to operate in vibration and noise challenged environments while on the move by foot or in a tactical vehicle.  Alternate Human-machine interface modalities including, but not limited to, Conversational Speech, Haptic/Touch input, Gestures, Device Motion, Eye Movement, and Brain Waves can be potentially leveraged to overcome this challenge.  CERDEC also has interest in identifying multimodal technologies, as well. <br>  <br>  <br> This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought announcement.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time. No response will be provided to requests for solicitation. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>DTRA is seeking information on the capability of responders to offer innovative approaches to enhance the capability to detect and localize threats posed by terrorist production of biological agents. Specifically, DTRA seeks sources which can assist the Agency in providing solutions to users for the standoff detection and identification of chemicals used as precursors or in bio-production processes and/or the resulting biological agents. Standoff detection is defined for the purposes of this Request for Information (RFI) as the ability to have a remote operator or sensor system capable of detecting the threat that is not in direct contact with the target agent or chemical compound. Examples would include strictly optical techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as well as local reaction/remote detection approaches, such as target-induced chemiluminescence combined with remote optics. The Program is not interested in mobile point detection approaches, such as robotic collection systems, or strictly theoretical concepts. DTRA anticipates the primary challenge to the development of effective technologies will be the capability to demonstrate the necessary area coverage, standoff range, agent/analyte selectivity and sensitivity in the presence of interferents. Sources with experience in developing materials and technologies which have characteristics related to this problem are highly encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) seeks to enhance its capability to respond to threats against Armed Forces and U.S. interests posed by biological weapons. The DTRA Bio-ISR program is dedicated to developing tactics and technologies to counter the growing threat of non-state biological laboratories with the potential for initiating bio-terrorism events. Infectious diseases especially can have a range of negative effects on both military operations and global health. Military personnel and civilian support personnel exposed to infectious agents can suffer illness and or death, resulting in degraded mission capability. Such scenarios can impede combat effectiveness, U.S. and Allied forces' morale, and can also increase the logistical burden for diagnosis, treatment, and evacuation.</p>
<p>DTRA J9CXSD is issuing this RFI to survey sources that have the capability to assist Agency staff in defining, developing, demonstrating, and transitioning a capability to counter the bio terrorism threat by leveraging innovative concepts and technologies. This RFI is specifically seeking information on sources that can provide the capabilities detailed below to support DTRA. Information gathered in response to this RFI will be used to support the development of a plan for future DTRA investments in counter-WMD technologies.</p>
<p>The respondents to this RFI should address the following criteria. Each respondent is highly encouraged to both describe the technical background and their process or approach for each applicable criterion and, if able, cite past or current examples of meeting the criterion.</p>
<p>1.) Ability to detect chemicals related to the production/storage of biological agents or the actual biological agents, such as pathogens, using a detection technique amenable to areal applications, i.e. not a point collection/detection system.<br />2.) Ability to provide detection at standoff ranges in excess of 100m. <br />3.) Covert or low-visibility operation of the detection system.<br />4.) Ability to determine concentration of agent/analyte.<br />5.) Near real-time operation.<br />6.) High probability of detection of specific targets with low false alarm rate.<br />7.) Ability to operate in non-ideal environmental and weather conditions.<br />8.) Ability to perform testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) of proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Initial solutions may not meet all of the desired criteria, but must be able to demonstrate a realistic development path that would provide an operationally viable system. Approaches using chemically reactive materials, nanoparticles or other innovative technologies must be instantiated by sufficient research to be able to support early proof-of-concept system demonstrations and be transitioned to users within 3 years.</p>
<p><br />Responses</p>
<p>Sources having the capability to meet these criteria are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to 10 pages, single spaced, 12 point font, with 1 inch margins, describing the source's ability to meet the objectives described in this document. Sources ability to meet the criteria should be supported by a description of the process or approach for each criterion and, if able, past examples of meeting the criterion. Supporting documentation for each area can be "appended" to the 10 page primary response; however, volumes of materials are not encouraged or welcome. Sources interested in this RFI are also asked to use a quad chart as a summary template for initial responses back to the Government. The quad chart should be a single presentation slide divided into four quadrants. A summary of capabilities; a summary of competitive advantages; a figure of merit; and relevant contact information, cost estimates, and estimated period of performance should populate the quad chart. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. For all RFI responses, an additional, nonproprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact, and contact information. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DTRA from non-government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Only electronic submissions will be reviewed. Electronic submissions should use the following subject heading: Biological Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (BIO-ISR) and the RFI Number. These submissions must be properly marked, and sent to the following e-mail addresses; julie.loiland@dtra.mil for NIPR or julie.loiland@dtra.smil.mil for SIPR. Responses to the RFI will not be returned and shall become the property of DTRA. All submissions must be received by 1500 EST on 31 Jan 2014.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for Solicitation and inquiries related to same will not receive a response. This RFI is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. Any and all information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI and shall become the property of DTRA.</p>
<p>The Government makes no future guarantees of a request for proposal release related to the effort. The above technical material responses from companies will be used to inform a strategic plan for future DTRA investments in counter WMD technologies.</p>

<SUBJECT>99--Idaho Site Post Fiscal Year 2015 Acquisition Planning
<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0006382
<CONTACT>LeAnn M. Brock
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Solicitation Number: 	DE-SOL-0006382 Title: Idaho Site Post Fiscal Year 2015 Acquisition Planning
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is currently in the acquisition planning phase for potential upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.  Since its inception in 1949, the Idaho Site has fulfilled numerous DOE missions including designing and testing nuclear reactors; reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover fissile materials; managing spent nuclear fuel; and storing, treating and disposing of various waste streams.  Currently, the Office of EM acts in the role of tenant on the site, while the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) serves as the landlord.  The mission of the Office of EM is to complete the safe cleanup of the environmental legacy brought about from five decades of nuclear weapons development and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. 
In May 2002, the DOE, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency signed a letter of intent formalizing an agreement to pursue accelerated risk reduction and cleanup at DOE's Idaho Site to achieve the following vision: "By 2012, the Idaho Site will have achieved significant risk reduction and will have placed materials in safe storage ready for disposal." While this goal has been achieved, there are still risk reduction and mission critical environmental management activities that need to be completed.  
As previously announced, the DOE plans to conduct an Industry Day on Wednesday, December 4, 2013, in support of the upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Details of this previous announcement were posted on November 15, 2013 as a Special Notice to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at:
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=feb19fc17e2864d408e8f4a9a34f38f3&tab=core&_cview=0
The DOE EM Consolidated Business Center (CBC) also created a procurement website where additional information will be provided which may be viewed here (as referenced on FBO):  
http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/IDAHO%20SITE%20POST%20FY%202015/index.php	
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit interested parties? input with the specialized capabilities necessary to meet all or part of the requirements of the Elements of Scope for efforts at the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Information provided at the Industry Day and on the EMCBC website is provided for industry?s assistance in preparation of Contractors? capability statements.  The information on the EMCBC website will be updated as it becomes available; therefore, Contractors should monitor the EMCBC website for additional information.  Within these capability statements, DOE is seeking feedback from contractors and other interested parties regarding options for innovative approaches for the performance of scope elements as well as insight into potential contracting alternatives to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015.  
Due to the preliminary stage of this planning activity, there is no Performance Work Statement available at this time.  The anticipated number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, amount of funding, or set aside possibilities are to be determined. The contemplated procurement(s) will incorporate remaining EM work scope following completion of the current Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) and the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) contracts.  The major Elements of Scope include, but are not limited to:
?	Spent Nuclear Fuel ?	Solid Waste Management ?	Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) ?	Environmental Activities ?	Site Infrastructure (EM Areas only) ?	Calcine Disposition Project
DOE is also seeking interested parties with specialized capabilities necessary to successfully perform all or a portion of the Elements of Scope defined above to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for small businesses, 8(a), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT. 
Capability Statements should include the following information as appropriate and applicable:  
1.)	Describe your ability and approach to meeting all or a portion of the requirements for the specific Elements of Scope, including innovative approaches for the division or aggregation of scope elements as well as insight into contracting alternatives (number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, set aside possibilities, etc.) to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015.
2.)	Identify any performance challenges and risks in meeting the requirements discussed in the Elements of Scope.  Identify how your organization would minimize any risks such that there is reasonable assurance of successful performance.  Also identify how a specific division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives could be utilized to minimize such risks.
3.)	Identify potential areas within any Element of Scope that may be appropriate for a fixed price contract structure along with any associated pricing challenges and risks.  Provide specific feedback for type of information required from DOE to support development of a fixed price proposal for any Elements of Scope.    4.)	Describe your experience in a complex regulatory environment in respect to problem-solving, working with various stakeholders, tribal governments, Citizens Advisory Boards, and regulatory agencies at the state and federal level. 
5.) Discuss your experience as a DOE Prime contractor.  Include a description of the work scope, contract value, contract type, period of performance and lessons learned.
6.) This work will be conducted throughout multiple complexes and facilities within the Idaho site and will require interface with the Management and Operating (M&O) contractor.  Discuss your experience regarding such interfaces.  Providing examples of previous experience, describe your company or teaming arrangement?s experience in managing and integrating all of the work similar to specific Elements of Scope included in your Capability Statement, including the continuing infrastructure activities (e.g. janitorial and grounds keeping services; operations, utilities, and maintenance of facilities) under a single contract.  Also describe your experience in managing and integrating the work of subcontractors who would perform specialty functions or subcontractor employees working within the site?s organizational matrix.
7.)  Discuss your experience in implementation of environmental, safety and health plans related to your (and any teaming partners) work on DOE sites with large industrial and nuclear facilities.  This discussion should address your approach to addressing requirements under 10 CFR 830 and 10 CFR 835 related to Nuclear Safety, Quality, and Occupational Radiological Protection; 10 CFR 851 Worker Safety and Health; Work Control Program, NQA-1 and ISMS.
8.)  Discuss your project management/project control system you would utilize for any resultant procurement supporting the Idaho Site post FY 2015, including information on the project control system you currently utilize for your company and how it will be tailored for any resultant procurement. 
9.) The contractor may be required to participate in the multi- employer pension and welfare benefits plans for the existing workforce covered by such plans while performing the requirements of any resultant procurement supporting the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Discuss your experience (or that of any teaming partners) in sponsoring employer pension and benefit plans at DOE sites. 
10.)  Brief Experience and Performance Record (past five years).  Identify all DOE, other Government, or other commercial experience relevant to this RFI (include contract number, date, scope, duration, client, and contracting agency contact).
Small business teams or joint ventures shall identify the socio-economic status of each member and shall provide a description of the work that each member would perform under a contract.  
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen pages, and no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party?s demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience and past performance in each of the scope areas specified to their area of expertise. 
All Interested parties are requested to provide their name of firm, point of contact, phone number, address of firm, CAGE Code, and/or a DUNS Number.
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation.  An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked, and sufficient justification provided as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review said information and safeguard it appropriately.
DOE will not respond to or post on the EMCBC website, any verbal or written questions or comments pertaining to this RFI package.  
The Government will not reimburse preparation costs nor otherwise provide compensation for any information that is provided in response to this announcement.  All capability statements shall be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address:  jodi.gordon@emcbc.doe.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Friday, December 20, 2013.  All questions pertaining to the announcement should be directed to Ms. LeAnn Brock at leann.brock@emcbc.doe.gov and/or telephone (513) 246-0563.  DOE personnel may contact firms responding to this announcement to clarify a responder?s capabilities and other matters as part of this market research process.

Examples of the Major Facilities to be operated under the proposed contract include: 8-by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel The 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel (8x6 SWT) is an atmospheric tunnel with perforated stainless steel walls that provide boundary layer control during transonic operations. It is the only transonic propulsion wind tunnel at NASA. Aircraft such as the Advanced Turboprop, the National Aerospace Plane, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the Joint Strike Fighter and the High Speed Civil Transport have been tested in this facility. 9x15 Low Speed Wind Tunnel The 9- by 15-Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel (9x15), housed in the return leg of the 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel, provides a unique facility for testing large-scale hardware in a continuous subsonic air stream. The test section is 9 ft. high and 15 ft. wide by 28 ft. long and provides airspeeds from 0 to 175 mph. The facility is used to evaluate aerodynamic performance and acoustic characteristics of nozzles, inlets, and propellers and to test short and vertical take-off and landing aircraft systems. Abe Silverstein Supersonic Wind Tunnel The Abe Silverstein Supersonic Wind Tunnel (10x10) was designed to test supersonic propulsion components such as inlets, nozzles, and engines. The facility is also ideally suited for launch vehicle tests and other fuel burning applications. It can operate as either a closed loop system (aerodynamic cycle) or open-loop system (propulsion cycle) and can reach test section speeds ranging from Mach 2.0 to 3.5. Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory This facility is an acoustically treated geodesic dome. The 130-ft-diameter dome is 65-ft high and acts as a noise barrier, protecting adjacent Glenn buildings and surrounding residential communities from the high levels of noise. The dome's two-foot thick fiberglass wedges located on the walls and floor provide an anechoic environment for acoustic measurement of aeropropulsion components. Ice Research Tunnel The Ice Research Tunnel (IRT) has played a substantial role in developing, testing, and certifying methods to prevent ice buildup on aircraft. The facility can produce continuous airspeeds from 50 to 350 kts and temperatures as low as -25 degrees Celsius year-round, controllable to within 0.5 degree Celsius. Supercooled water droplets between 15 and 50 microns and controllable water content can be produced to form an icing cloud. Space Power Facility The Space Power Facility (SPF) houses the world's largest space environment simulation chamber, measuring 100 ft. in diameter by 122 ft. high. In this chamber, large space-bound hardware can be tested in a severe environment similar to that encountered in space. The facility can sustain a high vacuum; simulate solar radiation via a 4-MW quartz heat lamp array, solar spectrum by a 400-kW arc lamp, and cold environments with a variable geometry cryogenic cold shroud. Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2) NASA's Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world's only high altitude test facility capable of full-scale rocket engine and launch vehicle system level tests. The facility supports mission profile thermal vacuum simulation and engine firing. The engine or vehicle can be exposed for indefinite periods to low ambient pressures, low-background temperatures, and dynamic solar heating, simulating the environment the hardware will encounter during orbital or interplanetary travel. Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) The Propulsion Systems Laboratory is NASA's only ground-based test facility that can provide true flight simulation for experimental research on air-breathing propulsion systems. Altitudes to 90,000 ft. and Mach numbers to 3.0 in one cell and 6.0 in the other can be simulated continuously. PSL is capable of performing research focused on the physics of ice crystal icing to support new engine development to meet newly proposed engine certification requirements. Zero Gravity Research Facility (Zero-G) The Zero Gravity Research Facility provides a near weightless or microgravity environment for a duration of 5.18 seconds. This is accomplished by allowing the experiment vehicle to free fall, in a vacuum, a distance of 432 ft. (132 m). The facility can provide a microgravity test environment for a fraction of the cost conducting an experiment in space and provides the best gravity levels of any of NASAs ground based low gravity facilities. Engine Research Building (ERB) With 152,235 square feet of floor space and housing more than 60 test rigs, the massive Engine Research Building (ERB) is the largest and most adaptable test facility complex at NASA Glenn. Almost half of the rigs support aeronautics programs in four general areas of research -- turbomachinery, combustion and aerochemistry, aeropropulsion, and aerodynamic fluid flow. Electric Propulsion Laboratory (EPL) The Electric Propulsion Laboratory (EPL) supports research and development of spacecraft power and electric propulsion systems. EPL features two very large space environment chambers; intermediate and smaller environment simulation chambers for testing small engines or components; bell jars used for small-scale development and component testing; and support areas. Research Combustion Laboratory (RCL) The Research Combustion Laboratory (RCL) develops aerospace propulsion technology by performing tests on propulsion components and materials. Altitudes up to 137,000 feet can be simulated. The Small Multi-Purpose Research Facility, or SMiRF, evaluates the performance of the thermal protection systems required to provide long-term storage (of up to 10 years) of cryogenic propellants in space. Cryogenic Components Laboratory (CCL) The Cryogenic Components Laboratory (CCL) is a new, state-of-the-art facility for research, development and qualification of cryogenic materials, components and systems. CCL specializes in cryogenic research utilizing liquid hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. The CCL is a complex of buildings and systems that is ideally suited for high-energy, high-risk development of cryogenic systems. Flight Research Building (Hangar) The NASA Glenn Flight Research Building is located at the NASA Glenn Research Center with aircraft access to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The facility is heated and spacious, 165 feet by 250 feet, and is large enough to hold numerous aircraft of various sizes. The facility houses the Learjet Model 25 and Twin Otter Icing Research Aircraft. Aircraft Operations at the NASA Glenn Research Center flies, maintains, and modifies the aircraft listed below for scientific research and aeronautical test purposes. Power Systems Facility (PSF) The Power Systems Facility (PSF) developed, tested and validated the electrical power systems for the International Space Station. PSF houses test beds where scientists and engineers verify critical design concepts, test prototype hardware and software, and system validation in real-time simulations and under actual loading and operating conditions. Structural Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) Structural dynamic testing is performed to verify the survivability of a component or assembly when exposed to vibration stress screening, or a controlled simulation of the actual flight or service vibration environment. Environmental stress screening, or workmanship vibration, is used to identify latent manufacturing defects of components prior to being incorporated into larger assemblies. Vibration testing is also used to verify design margins of assemblies and characterize the internal dynamic responses of a test article. Materials Research Laboratory Support Research areas include advanced materials and coating systems for aerospace propulsion and power, computational methods, materials processing and characterization, multifunctional and adaptive structures, structural mechanics and life prediction methodology for application of advanced materials in propulsion and space structures, structural dynamics and impact mechanics, aeroelasticity, drive systems, seals, and tribology for aeropropulsion and space exploration.

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.</p>
<p>As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through FedBizOpps. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the MoFlo Astrios w/Intellisort II.</p>
<p>The NCI CCR Vaccine Branch Flow Core has been created to fulfill an urgent, unmet need on NCI for a Core with BL2/BL3 containment, able to safely sort live cells infected with retroviruses, such as HIV/SIV, and other infectious agents known or suspected in blood and tissue samples. The VB Flow Cytometry Core currently supports CCR investigators from 13 branches including the Vaccine Branch, the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression and the Cancer Genetics Branch.</p>
<p>The VB Flow Cytometry Core is currently equipped with one FACSAria II cell sorter. The FACSAria II is configured with 488 nm, 640 nm, and 405 nm lasers and 12-color capability for cell sorting. This laser configuration does not allow for cell sorting of samples utilizing the fluorescent fruit proteins (such as mCherry) that have become popular with CCR investigators. There is an urgent and compelling need for a cell sorter with the 561 nm laser needed for this type of cell sorting. This cell sorter needs to be equipped with 488 nm, 561nm, 640nm and 405nm lasers, 18 color capability, index sorting into 96-well plates, and a biological safety cabinet for infectious single cell sorting. In addition to supporting cell sorting of infectious cells and samples expressing fluorescent fruit proteins, this cell sorter needs to support the new nanoFACS application currently being developed at NCI.</p>
<p><strong>The cell sorter to be purchased for the Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core Facility must also meet the following criteria:</strong></p>

<DESC>PURPOSE
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is released to conduct market research for planning purposes only. This RFI shall not be considered an invitation for bid, request for proposal, or in any way an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI, or the Government use of any information provided. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>
<p>Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the U. S. Department of State (DOS) in developing its acquisition strategy, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>(a) Requirements definition and determination of commercial availability;<br />(b) Logical grouping of items for a single competition or multiple competitions;<br />(c) Decision to make single or multiple awards under each competition;<br />(d) Socio-economic set-aside decisions;<br />(e) Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition/Limited Sources Justification/Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity (e.g. only one source or brand name only);<br />(f) Potential use of existing government-wide contract vehicles;<br />(g) Identification of the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards (see 36 CFR 1194) that can or cannot be met by supplies that are available in the commercial marketplace in time to meet the agency's delivery requirements.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. DOS is requesting industry feedback on its ability to provide supplies based on the requirements described herein.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Global Information Technology Modernization program (GITM) is a centralized DOS program providing unclassified and classified desktops, servers, and core local area network (LAN) IT equipment modernizations through a standardized lifecycle refresh process. GITM's customer base spans the globe. As part of GITM's search for new lifecycle refresh technology, the GITM office is requesting industry to identify commercially available IT supplies meeting core technical requirements:</p>
<p>(a) All suggested line items must meet general security requirements, general technical requirements, and general procurement/warranty requirements as specified in Attachment A - CLIN List and General Requirements. <br />(b) In addition to meeting the general requirements, each item must meet detailed specifications as follows -<br />(1) Storage Systems, 22 items and components (See Attachment B);<br />(2) Server Systems, 15 items and components ( See Attachment C);<br />(3) Uninterruptible Power Supplies, 4 items and components (See Attachment D); and<br />(4) Network Appliances, 149 items and components (See Attachment E).</p>
<p><br />RFI RESPONSE CONTENT AND FORMAT</p>
<p>(a) The Government is not interested in marketing responses and such generic documents will not be considered by the Department. Only responses meeting these specific instructions shall be included in the Department's market research analysis.</p>
<p>(b) Failure to comply with any of these instructions may result in removal of the response from the Department's RFI/market research analysis. The Department is under no obligation to request clarification or additional information not provided in the initial response.</p>
<p>(c) ALL respondents must submit completed Attachment A - CLIN List and General Requirements, which includes -</p>
<p>(1) Respondent company and contact information;<br />(2) Line item ("CLIN") list, for the respondent to indicate which of the supplies it can provide, including any available government-wide contract vehicle information; <br />(3) Separate tabs with general security requirements, general technical requirements, and general procurement/warranty requirements, to be completed by the respondent.</p>
<p>(d) RFI respondents are NOT required to supply all of the requested items (although they are highly encouraged to do so if able). Respondents may provide one or more items under this RFI.</p>
<p>(e) If any item supplied by the respondent is the exact brand and part number identified in the government Attachment, then indicate "Y" for "Yes" in Attachment A, Column D ("RESPONDENT RESELLS &amp; SUGGESTS DOS BRAND NAME AND P/N (Y/N)"). DO NOT submit Attachments B through E for reselling the identified brand name items - DOS already knows their specifications. (Therefore, if all items supplied by the respondent are the exact brand and part number identified in the government Attachments, then only Attachment A - CLIN List and General Requirements need be submitted.)</p>
<p>(f) If the respondent suggests any alternative brand or part number (an "equal") then the respondent must complete the corresponding tab in the corresponding Attachment B through E. If you complete and submit any tabs within Attachment B, C, D, or E, you must complete the "RESPONDENT INFO" tab at the front, which requests company and POC information.</p>
<p>(g) For all items suggested by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal"), the respondent should submit supporting documentation as indicated in the spreadsheets. For example, to support the claim that your suggested alternate is Energy Star compliant or EPEAT Silver certified, provide a URL/web link where the DOS can verify Energy Star listing or EPEAT certification of that product. Where an item has a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), the MSDS should be provided. (These are just a few examples; there are other areas in the spreadsheets where supporting documentation is requested.) Supporting documentation must be provided either as additional attachments (.pdf format preferred) or as a URL/web link. Again, this documentation is only required for items supplied by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal"); do NOT provide these supporting documents for the exact brand and part numbers identified in the government Attachment - DOS already has that information.</p>
<p>(h) For all items suggested by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number, the completed tab in Attachment B, C, D, or E must include the manufacturer model and part number, as well as a detailed description of the salient specifications being proposed corresponding to each government requirement. Entering "meets" or "compliant" or "exact match", or similar in the Respondent Suggested Specification column without supporting salient characteristics may be deemed a non-responsive submission and may be removed from the government's RFI/market research analysis.</p>
<p>(i) The respondent should also use the "Respondent Suggested Specification" column in each spreadsheet to identify any specifications/requirements that it considers to be overly restrictive of competition based on the commercial marketplace. In such cases, the respondent should explain why it feels the specification is overly restrictive or unnecessary and should provide alternative technology suggestions or an explanation of how the government can meet its performance objectives with alternative commercial items.</p>
<p>(j) For all items supplied by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal"), the respondent must provide the manufacturer's Voluntary Product Assessment Template (VPAT) showing the extent to which the Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to that product are met or are not met by that product.</p>
<p>(k) All documents must be submitted in the government-supplied Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) format, with no changes to the government-created cells or formatting.</p>
<p>(l) Respondents must NOT submit their responses in any alternate format (e.g. MS Word, Adobe .pdf, or in the body of an email). Such responses will not be accepted. Only the government's MS Excel Attachments A through E shall be accepted, in MS Excel format, as attachments to the submission email.</p>
<p>(m) Respondents must complete the government's spreadsheets as instructed. Manufacturer's product specification sheets or technical documents are NOT desired and will not be considered, unless necessary to support a specification or function declared in the completed spreadsheets.</p>
<p>In summary, the complete submission package shall be an email sent to OlsonBR@state.gov, with the following attachments:</p>
<p>(a) Completed Attachment A, MS Excel. (Make sure you review all applicable tabs in the MS Excel workbook - scroll to the right!);<br />(b) Completed Attachments B through E, MS Excel, for any items supplied by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal"). (Make sure you review all applicable tabs in each MS Excel workbook - scroll to the right!);<br />(c) Supporting documentation (e.g. E-STAR, as indicated in the spreadsheets) for all items (if any) supplied by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal");<br />(d) Section 508 manufacturer's VPATs for all items (if any) supplied by the respondent as an alternative brand or part number (an "equal").</p>
<p>Pricing information is not requested, may not be submitted, and will not be considered at this time.</p>
<p><br />QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Questions must be submitted by email to OlsonBR@state.gov such that they are received at that electronic address no later than December 9, 2013, 2:00PM EST. Answers to questions that are timely received will be aggregated and attached to this FedBizOpps notice prior to the closing date/time of this notice. All communications regarding this RFI shall be directed to Brian Olson, Support Contractor, U.S. Department of State, at the contact information listed in this posting.</p>

	The network size of the HTTP response including headers
	Chunked encoding
-	The solution must be able to display secure browser sessions that use the HTTPS protocol in their unencrypted form, making it easier to debug applications.
-	The solution must be able to support the SPDY protocol in Firefox 13+ showing information about the SPDY level stream.
-	The solution must be able to record traffic to a log file including performance information, page events, timings, status codes, errors, and warnings.
-	The solution must include a standalone log file viewer allows the solutions log files to be viewed and modified outside the browser.
-	The solution must be able to view recorded traffic in a summary view that can be used at any time to quickly display data about the whole log, a single page or a number of selected items.
-	The solution must be able to group requests by page and each page group must be able to be separately expanded or collapsed to aid navigation through large log files.
-	The solution must have page level time charts that are displayed and updated in real-time as requests are recorded by the solution.
 
-	The solution must have request level time charts that display for each request broken down into a number of colored sections to show network level timings such as DNS lookup and TCP connects.
-	The solution must have page level event time charts including vertical lines to indicate DOM Load, page load, render start, and HTTP load events with the timing of each event available in the data tip or Page Events tab.
-	The solution must be able to examine each request and issues warnings where problems relating to performance, security or functionality are detected. Requests that have warnings must be highlighted with a Warning column marker request level Warnings tab showing the details of each potential problem.

The existing VA owned nursing home capacity is extremely limited and insufficient to care for the large veteran population within VISN 15.   In addition, projected number of veterans requiring nursing home care services is expected to increase significantly in the next 20 years due to aging population.  
Resource Utilization Group (RUG) IV rates will be established through negotiations based on the facility's Medicaid rate plus.  Care will be in accordance with the RUG IV case-mix, the industry standard.  RUG-IV defines patients for clinical and reimbursement purposes.  This system utilized information from the Minimum Data Set, Version 3.0 (MDS-3) assessment to classify Skilled Nursing Facility residents into a series of groups representing the resident's relative direct care resource requirement.  Medicaid and Medicare qualified facilities will be required to comply with 42 USC,  1396R.

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities, veteran health needs, and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Order Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  Suitable community organizations to provide community nursing home care services generally will require:

"	Assessment of need with consideration of relevant veteran population in specific areas and number of existing Agreements already serving those areas.
"	Distance of contract facility from area of consideration.
"	Number of available beds.
"	Nursing Home Compare rating of Average (3 stars) in each of the three areas of review.
"	Current State License
"	Prospective Contractor must have current registration in System For Award Management (SAM).
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award
"	Prospective Contractor must submit a completed VA Form 10-1170, "Application for Furnishing Long-Term Care" prior to consideration for award.
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA exclusion review (fire safety, general safety, and compliance review conducted by VA personnel) prior to award
Offerors having the capabilities necessary to provide the above stated services are invited to provide information to contribute to this Sources Sought notice including commercial market information and company information via e-mail to Grace Windler at grace.windler@va.gov no later than December 26, 2013.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Interactive Data Corporation for the Trust Accounting System. The Trust Accounting System (TAS) is an investment portfolio and accounting solution managed by the Financial Operations Department (FOD) to support the accounting and financial reporting of investment assets, plan receivables, and liabilities related to terminated pension plans and the commingled investment portfolio through an application service provider model. One core component of this solution is the ability to automatically obtain market data including security master file updates, securities prices, and corporate actions for securities within the portfolios of terminated pension plans.<br /><br />Upon receiving a system request through the Trust Accounting System (TAS) the pricing service provider Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) obtains applicable prices for securities requested and creates a normalized file which is delivered though a pull process. Data is pulled by the TAS application server from the IDC pricing service and processed using the Message Center in Eagle ADMS. In addition, PBGC users leverage IDC's Remote Plus toolset to make ad hoc requests for securities prices directly within Microsoft Excel templates which are later uploaded into specialized message streams in Eagle ADMS.<br /><br />The only company able to provide Interactive Data Corporations' Fund Run and Remote Plus Products is Interactive Data Corporation. The IDC Fund Run and Remote Plus are commercial off the shelf service developed and supported exclusively by Interactive Data Corporation.
<p>The contract action is being sought under the FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Period of Performance is a Base Period of July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, and four (4) Option Periods, July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015; July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016; July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017 and July 1, 2017 - June 30 2018.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals but a Notice of Intent. No solicitation will be issued. Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later than 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, on May 10, 2013) by email to the Contract Specialist; Teesa Roberts at roberts.teesa@pbgc.gov.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-01-326-1816<br />Name:		Stool, Folding, Military<br />Description:	Military folding stool; height is 17" and features a woodland camouflage fabric seat with 1" diameter aluminum legs painted non-glare olive drab and equipped with black crutch tips. UOI is BX. BX = 6 stools.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7105-01-326-1816<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MBA1816; SU1816</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 11, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.

<p>The United States Women's Chamber of Commerce<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Margot Dorfman (Host) along with Janet Hern of SME ll Transportation of DLA Land and Maritime Columbus will sponsor a First Destination Transportation Packaging Initiative (F.D.T.P.I) Webinar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The FDTPI project entails the implementation of transportation and packaging concepts approved by DLA leadership that will transform the DLA business model in the manner in which supplies are transported and packaged. First destination shipments from suppliers to DLA include transportation and military standard (MIL-STD) packaging costs which are "bundled" into the acquisition price of the materiel, obscuring the real cost of the products. FDTPI will unbundle first-destination freight (FDT) and packaging (FDP) costs from the acquisition price of new-procurement materiel and utilize government personnel or contracted services to provide freight and/or MIL-STD packaging more efficiently than is possible by many DLA suppliers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;FDTPI is one of DLA's "Big Ideas" designed to generate substantial savings over the five-year Fiscal Year Defense Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The website is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>http://www.uswcc.org/</p>

The contractor is Sikorsky Aerospace Maintenance, Inc. (SAM). This effort will provide continuity of Organizational(O), Intermediate(I), and limited depot(D) level maintenance and logistics support services. The bridge&nbsp;extension will cover a period of performance of approximately 12 months that will commence on 1 January 2014 and end on 31 December 2014. The bridge is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to end as of 31 December 2013. The purpose of this bridge is to bridge the gap in Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services between the period of performance for the current contract and the follow on contract. The current F-5 solicitation # N00019-R-13-0092 is posted on FBO and the NAVAIR solicitation website for the follow on contract.<br /><br /><strong>This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government.</strong> The incumbent contractor currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required service. Resolicitation for the 12 month period would not only result in a break in service but would incur excessive cost to the Government. For information contact Karen Lynch, via email karen.d.lynch@navy.mil. <br />

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Act-</p>
<p>(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or<br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.</p>

<p>(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>Addendum Paragraph (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror shall state on its quote that the quoted prices in its offer are firm until January 31, 2014.</p>

To ensure information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service meets the technical requirements. Quotes shall include technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information corresponding to each minimum required item, which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror.</p>

An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov/far/ .</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK: TELECONFERENCING/VIDEOCONFERENCING SUPPORT SERVICES</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Scientific Review Program (SRP) at the NIH NIAID conducts the peer review of grants and contracts that are submitted for funding.  No grant or R and D contract gets funded at the NIH without first being peer reviewed.  We recruit experts from around the world to review approximately 1800 grant and contract proposals each year.  For many years the standard was to bring these reviewers to the Washington DC area for face to face meetings.  In past years we have been decreasing the number of face to face meetings and increasing the number of teleconference/videoconference meetings.  This has increased our reliance on reliable teleconference/videoconference service providers.  In 2012, SRP conducted approximately 320 digital conferences including participants from around the world.  The total meeting minutes comprised approximately 50,000 minutes and we expect to use the same number of minutes during the 2014 performance period.</p>

<ARCHDATE>12272013
<CONTACT>Robert B Gallagher 831-656-7853
<DESC>The NPS requires the production of aluminum-copper binary alloy feed stock powders for cold spray deposition.  The powders we seek have the following required characteristics:
	Four compositions of Al-2wt% Cu, Al-3wt% Cu, Al-4wt% Cu, and Al-5wt% Cu.
	Production by inert gas atomization (either nitrogen or argon).
	Nearly spherical particle shapes
	A size range with a D-50 of 20 microns.

In addition, the NPS requires at least 40 pounds of powder per composition and a lead-time of no longer than 120 days.

Each prospective vendor must provide supporting documentation that demonstrates previous, successful production of a 2000-series (e.g. AA2024) aluminum alloy powder via the gas atomization process with a particle size of -270 mesh or finer.
  Examples of documentation include mesh sizing data, particle sizing data, images of particles, and compositional certifications.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with Darwin Chambers Company LLC., 2945 Washington Ave, Saint Louis, MO 63103-1305, as the only responsible source that can provide calibration and preventative maintenance on the environmental chambers in the Environmental Toxicology Research Facility. <br>  <br> The basic requirements are below: <br>  <br> Research is conducted to address the complex interactions of environmental contaminants with diverse biological components of the ecosystem. The research facilities must be maintained and calibrated to allow for precise control of lighting, temperature, heat and humidity.  <br>  <br> The contractor will provide all labor and expertise needed to execute comprehensive preventive maintenance and NIST calibration of the (5) walk-in controlled environmental chambers located in Vicksburg, MS. <br>  <br> The contractor will annually conduct a comprehensive preventive maintenance and each chamber will receive a thorough check-out to ensure all systems are operating safely and at their optimum capability. <br>  <br> The contractor will perform calibrations on (5) temperature and relative humidity controlled environmental chambers.  All calibrations are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Each instrument will receive three-point calibration verification.  The as-found readings will be documented and the device returned to service.  In the event that the as-found readings are not within the manufacturer's stated accuracy, the instrument will be calibrated using the manufacturer's calibration procedure.  After calibrating the instrument, the as-left readings will be documented using the same three points from the calibration verification to verify the instrument is reading with-in the manufacturer's stated accuracy.  If any instrument exceeds the process tolerance, the contractor will document and promptly notify responsible ERDC staff members. <br>  <br> Contractor assumes travel costs to perform tasks.  <br>  <br> The expertise and capability to perform this requirement is linked to the proprietary design of the systems and the specialized training and equipment required.  The manufacturer of the chambers is the only option for maintenance and calibration. <br>  <br> This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 238390 with a Small Business Size Standard of $14 Million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.   However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>  <br> Capability statements shall be submitted only by e-mail as a Microsoft Office Word, Microsoft Office Excel, or Adobe PDF attachment to Amanda.Andrews@usace.army.mil.  Statements are due by 1200 (12:00pm) Central Standard Time 9 December 2013.  No phone calls will be accepted.   <br>  <br> Point of Contact <br>  <br> Amanda Andrews, Contract Specialist, Phone 601-634-5249, Email Amanda.Andrews@uasce.army.mil

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement - offeror shall submit a portfolio of sample portraits/works completed and describe their process used to complete the portrait.

<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

I would suggest that you go to the original supplier of the test stand if we do not have further details.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause? (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are? (A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means? (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. <BR> <BR>(i) Payments. (1) Work performed. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?.?] <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK: TELECONFERENCING/VIDEOCONFERENCING SUPPORT SERVICES</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Scientific Review Program (SRP) at the NIH NIAID conducts the peer review of grants and contracts that are submitted for funding. No grant or R and D contract gets funded at the NIH without first being peer reviewed. We recruit experts from around the world to review approximately 1800 grant and contract proposals each year. For many years the standard was to bring these reviewers to the Washington DC area for face to face meetings. In past years we have been decreasing the number of face to face meetings and increasing the number of teleconference/videoconference meetings. This has increased our reliance on reliable teleconference/videoconference service providers. In 2012, SRP conducted approximately 320 digital conferences including participants from around the world. The total meeting minutes comprised approximately 50,000 minutes and we expect to use the same number of minutes during the 2014 performance period.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) - New Jersey, on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 10, 2013 for the manufacturing, inspection, testing, and delivery of the FMU-160 A/B HIGH FRAGMENTATION (HFF) PROXIMITY FUZE, with POINT DETONATING (PD) backup.  The program satisfies the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) requirements for fiscal years 2013-2017, for AC-130 Gunship training and tactical missions.    <br>     <br>  The FMU-160A/B Fuze is a radio frequency HF proximity fuze with a PD backup. The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 332993 and the FSC code is 1390.  The NSN for the FMU-153 A/B PD/DLY Fuze is 1390-01-616-7163.  The FMU-160 A/B Fuze is used to detonate the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF) High Explosive (HE) Projectile Gun Unit (PGU) 45/B Cartridge.  The PGU-45/B is an asset on the AC-130 Gunship, and is fired out of a modified 105mm Howitzer.  The FMU-160 A/B is set to provide a 15-foot height of burst.  The height of burst optimizes the lethality of the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF), High Explosive (HE), PGU-45/B Cartridge.   <br>    <br>  Competition for this requirement will be restricted under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (3), and FAR 6.302-3 (a)(2)(i), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or Expert Services, from companies within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) in order to maintain or create the required domestic capability within the U.S., its outlying areas, and Canada.  Under the authority, the contract will require that the contractor obtain the FMU-160 A/B Fuze assembly, and the detonator and explosive train (to include the explosives themselves) from within the NTIB.  The balance of FMU-160 A/B Fuze sub-assemblies and sub-components are unrestricted.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The effort will result in award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract consisting of 5 one-year ordering periods, with priced ordering ranges.  The estimated maximum contract value will be $22,250,000 with a minimum guarantee of $700,000.     Each ordering period will consist of the following ordering ranges:  500-2,000; 2,001-5,000; 5,001-20,000.    <br>    <br>  The technical data package is Distribution  quote mark D quote mark - approved for release to Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors.  The requirement will be solicited/manufactured against a Performance Specification.  The requirement will require the contractor to work with explosives.  Any request by DoD Contractors for Distribution Level  quote mark D quote mark  data shall be accompanied by the following:  a fully executed DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement, and a completed AMSTA-AR 1350.  After review of the forms, offerors will be notified of the disposition of approval/disapproval to receive the TDP.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0001 is to provide some additional information in response to some questions received in response to the sources sought announcement.  <br>  <br> Question 1: In looking over the list of munitions under consideration, would it be possible to get the DODICs for the munitions being considered under each family so we can evaluate the specific rounds that would be included?  <br>  <br> Answer 1: At this time we are unable to provide a listing of DODICs due to the information not being available yet.  <br>  <br> Question 2: There is also some inconsistency in the description of the 25mm and 30mm cartridges in the solicitation which states that they are HE filled, and the munitions list indicates that they are depleted uranium. The DU rounds do not have HE filler. <br>  <br> Answer 2: The MIDAS code saying DUM for those cartridges is incorrect and the cartridges are HE filled or inert slug rounds, not DU.  The table has been corrected.  <br>  <br> Question 3: Is munitions listing a CBU-88 correct? We find no information for a CBU-88 except for an obscure reference to a CBU-88/B Smokeye which was believed to contain 3 bombs each containing 72 lbs of red phosphorus. Could it possibly be the CBU-89 instead? <br>  <br> Answer 3: NO, CBU-88 is not correct.  The table has been corrected to show it should be listed as CBU-87A/B and CBU 87B/B.  <br>  <br> Question 4: Regarding the subject Sources Sought Notice, is this a new requirement or a follow-on effort? If this is a follow-on, would you please provide the incumbent contract information? <br>  <br> Answer 4: This is a new requirement.  <br>  <br> Question 5: Why are there no DPICMs identified in the tabulated listing of munitions?  <br>  <br> Answer 5: This list was representative of munitions that were being considered to allow the Army to gauge interest in future contract work and that any RFP that may result from this sources sought will contain a more definitive list of actual munitions. <br>  <br>

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>This announcement has been amended to include the draft SOW.

FAA will be holding an Industry Day for the CLEEN II solicitation on December 3, 2013 at the Washington DC Convention Center.  Under NextGen, the FAA initiated the Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program in 2010 to accelerate development and commercialization of aircraft technology and sustainable alternative jet fuels to mitigate aviations impact on the environment.  The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish a follow on program from the original CLEEN Program.  This follow on program is referred to as CLEEN II.  CLEEN II, like CLEEN, would be a public-private partnership, in which FAA and industry cost-share maturation and demonstration of promising aircraft technologies.

The CLEEN II Industry Day will provide an opportunity for those interested in potentially submitting proposals to the CLEEN II Screening Information Request (SIR) to hear about FAA plans for CLEEN II and the SIR, to ask questions, and provide feedback.  The Industry Day will include an open session Q&A time, as well as a limited number of sessions for one-on-one discussions with FAA.

This event is closed to the media. However, reporters can email Hank Price or call him at (202) 267-3447 for information or to schedule a post-conference interview.

Please email any comments or questions on the draft SOW to cleen@faa.gov by December 10, 2013.


LOCATION

Walter E. Washington Convention Center
801 Mt. Vernon Pl NW
Washington, D.C. 20001
Room 204 A,B,C


REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS

To register for the event, to ask any questions ahead of time to be answered in the public question times, and to sign up for 1-on-1 sessions for aircraft technology and alternative fuels discussions, please email cleen@faa.gov.

<DESC>Industry Day Questions 12/11/2012 1) Will the RFP specify an integration facility (location, size, capabilities)? If so, at what point in the contract does the government anticipate requiring the Offeror to have the facility up and running? Answer: As this is an integration contract, an integration facility is a requirement. Specifics of the facility will be proposed in Offerors&acirc;&euro;&trade; proposals. This facility will be required to be up and running in time to meet development, integration and certification of software and hardware in order to meet the Fleet installation schedule. 2) Will OMS signal processing and display be performed in CAC hardware? Answer: OMS boundaries are defined as the physical input to the analog telemetry acquisition units, ships&acirc;&euro;&trade; cabling, and current hardware footprints. OMS software is intended to be reconfigurable and can run in multiple AN/BQQ-10 cabinets, including the CAC. The processed information will be displayed on the ECDWS, the Engine Room Display (ERD) and the Dive Officer of the Watch (DOOW) display. 3) When will the Technical Information Center (TIC) in Newport be open? Answer: There will be separate TICs for each of the three contracts. Access to each TIC will be made available when the applicable draft RFP is released. 4) Slide 18 shows a TBD integrator on lower right and a central box labeled Sonar Integration. Can you allocate proposed contracts to these two integration roles? Answer: Please note the label on the left side of the slide, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;TBD Industry Partners.&acirc;&euro; Because these procurements are competitive, the Navy cannot name successful Offeror&acirc;&euro;&trade;s without having conducted the competition. The &acirc;&euro;&oelig;TBD Integrator&acirc;&euro; will be the winner of the A-RCI Integration competitive procurement. This Offeror will be responsible for the software development of the strings identified (SA, HFP, etc.) as well as ensuring test and certification of the entire ARCI system. Many other partners contribute hardware and software to this effort, as indicated by the arrows pointing to the Sonar Integration box. It is the responsibility of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;TBD integrator&acirc;&euro; to work with all of those partners to develop and certify the full system. 5) The OMS contract covers OMS Production and data signal processing development. Of OMS hardware components, sensors, telemetry, processing and display hardware, what all will be delivered under the OMS contract? Answer: This will be defined in the OMS specification. Offerors have the opportunity to propose a new, innovative telemetry scheme. OMS will be displayed on the ECDWS (display hardware is NOT the responsibility of the OMS Offeror), the ERD and the DOOW (both of which ARE the responsibility of the Offeror). Other hardware components and sensors can remain the same or be modified or replaced as indicated by the Offerors&acirc;&euro;&trade; proposals. 6) Since TI-16 and APB-15 are undefined how will Offerors scope and cost the effort? Will the government specify labor categories and hours in the RFP? Answer: Although TI-16 and APB-15 are undefined, the Offeror should be able to scope and cost the effort based on the current available technical GFI (located in the TIC), the Offeror&acirc;&euro;&trade;s experience, and their expertise. The Offeror shall propose a labor mix based on the skill levels and hours they believe will be required to satisfy the RFP requirements. 7) What are the relevant NAICS codes for each of the procurements? Answer: ARCI, CAC and OMS &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; NAICS code is 334511 8) For CAC, what are the relevant MIL-Standard requirements for the cabinet (MIL-SPEC-A&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;Mission Critical)? Answer: The CAC enclosure will be provided as GFE. It will be a Grade B cabinet and requirements will be provided in the Performance Specification in the TIC. 9) For CAC, what is the expected value of the contract? Answer: Anticipated maximum value of the CAC contract will be $50 million. 10) For CAC, what are the expected production numbers per year? Answer: Will be provided with draft RFP. 11) For CAC, if there is a current incumbent, who is it? Answer: The CAC is the replacement cabinet for the Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP). GD-AIS is the incumbent on the MPP design. 12) What are your expected Navy Budgets for each of the three procurements over the contract durations? This information will assist Industry in performing the necessary ROI determinations prior to making any Bid decision. Answer: Estimated maximum values of the contracts are as follow: ARCI &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; $1.9 billion CAC &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; $50 million OMS &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; $50 million 13) Is an Oral Presentation part of all three competitions? Answer: Yes. 14) Will OMS and CAC also require ORAL Presentations? Answer: Yes. 15) Will the CAC be considered as a replacement candidate for any of the other acoustic cabinets? Answer: Offerors are welcome to propose any innovations thought beneficial to the Navy. 16) Since both CAC and OMS are based on legacy SBIR designs, what level of technical data will be provided to competitors for their successors? Answer: Successful Offerors will deliver based on the Performance Specification provided for review in the TIC. Source technical materials such as the IETM will be provided as GFI. 17) Is the Diving Officer of the Watch display part of the CAC or OMS? Answer: The DOOW display is part of the OMS contract. 18) Technology Insertion (TI) Working Groups are currently making decisions and performing Analysis that will determine the TI-14 Hardware configurations. Since the TI-16 and TI-18 hardware configurations will be derivatives of the TI-14 design, may potential bidders participate in these working groups or be provided their meeting notes and design decisions in order to prepare their proposals in response to the RFP&acirc;&euro;&trade;s? Answer: The Navy is looking at allowing prospective bidders to observe in the TI Working Groups. However, a final decision on this has not been determined at this time. A further response will be provided when a determination has been reached. 19) Are the string development responsibilities for SA/HFP/LCCA/LWWAA part of the A-RCI Integrators responsibilities, or will they be GFE/GFI to the successful bidder for the Integrator&acirc;&euro;&trade;s role? Answer: See answer to Question #4. 20) Why has the government made the CAC a Small Business Set Aside? Answer: As per the FAR, a decision was made to set aside this contract for small business. See Subpart 19.502-2(b). 21) What is the IWS-5 involvement with OMS software? Will an initial build of OMS software be provided to the OMS contractor? Answer: There will be limited involvement with IWS-5A. OMS software will not be provided to the OMS contractor; it will be the contractor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s responsibility to develop and deliver this. 22) If new Towed Array sensors become available that change the way the array is processed, will it be introduced on the TI schedule or the APB schedule? Answer: Array processing changes could be either software or hardware dependent on the scope of the change. Introduction of new sensor technology will be coordinated through the PMS401 program office. 23) What are the numbers in parentheses on slide 20? Answer: These are the Unit Numbers of each of the current ARCI cabinets. 24) How do capability shortfalls that require a hardware solution feed into the TI process? For example, if the fleet determined that sonar displays would be more effective if presented in a stereoscopic or 3D cube (Voxel) display hardware, how would the A-RCI developmental process implement both the TI to provide the new displays as well as the APB software needed to use the new hardware? Answer: Capability shortfalls are identified by the Submarine Tactical Requirements Group (STRG). IWS-5A evaluates these capabilities and develops any required software applications. If there are hardware changes required to enable these capabilities, these are addressed by PMS401 via solutions developed through the Technology Insertion (TI) Integrated Product Team (IPT). 25) In addition to PMS-401's direct needs: 1) is it anticipated IWS-5 will procure integration services for APB's through the upcoming ARCI contract; or that 2) APB integration services are/will be provided by separate procurement; or that 3) the APB process does not include a traditional lead integration agent role? Answer: IWS-5 does not integrate, that is a program office responsibility. The A-RCI contract can be used by IWS-5, if required. 26) Will today's Industry Day attendance list be made available to attendees [desirable for promoting teaming opportunities]? Answer: No. It is the responsibility of the prospective Offeror to determine teaming partners. 27) Will the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) contract specify &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Build to Print&acirc;&euro; or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Build to Spec&acirc;&euro;? Answer: Build to Specification under an LOE contract. Ownship Monitoring System (OMS) RFP N00024-12-R-6268 Questions: 28) Are capability improvements above TSMS baseline planned for the OMS competition? Answer: Offerors are welcome to propose any innovations thought beneficial to the Navy. Requirements are identified in the OMS specification located in the TIC. 29) Will this be a build-to-print or build-to-spec based on TI-12/TI-14 Design baseline? Answer: OMS will be built-to-spec according to the OMS specification located in the TIC. 30) Will Government owned TI-12 baseline product fabrication drawings, procedures, ILS/IETM source and training materials be made available as part of RFP for bidding? Answer: No. 31) Will Government owned TI-14 baseline deliverable documentation be made available as GFI in support of contract award for TI-16? Answer: Since TI-14 baseline design is just beginning, TI-14 deliverable documentation will not be available in time for this competition. 32) Will the RFP include the anticipated Quantity of procurements by year or Total for the 5 year period of performance of the contract? Answer: The RFP will include the total expected quantity. This number changes dependent on the outcome of the quarterly C5I conference. Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) RFP N00024-13-R-6269 Questions: 33) Will the CAC RFP and competition include any new TA/HA software development and integration efforts, or will it be specifically to provide the Hardware rack and components with supporting ILS source and training products. Answer: The CAC RFP and competition will result in the cabinet internals for a GFE enclosure. Supporting ILS source and training products will be part of this. TA/HA software development is NOT part of this contract. 34) Will the CAC be a build to spec based off of the existing TI-12 or TI-14 cabinet design or a build to print with drawings furnished? Answer: The CAC will be built-to-spec based on the CAC specification located in the TIC. 35) Will Government owned Deliverables like Product Drawings, Assy/Test Procedures, ILS/IETM source, Training material etc. for TI-12 baseline be made available as part of the RFP. Answer: No source material will be provided. Product information from COTS venders for the TI12 servers and switches will be provided. In addition, the TI12 IETM (fleet ready version) will be available via the TIC. 36) Will Government owned TI-14 baseline deliverable documentation be made available as GFI in support of contract award for TI-16? Answer: Since TI-14 baseline design is just beginning, TI-14 deliverable documentation will not be available in time for this competition. 37) Will delivery of the Dual Towed Array Power Supply (DTAPS) and Telemetry Receiver be part of the CAC solicitation or will these elements be provided as GFE to the contractor? Answer: These elements will not be provided as GFE. The CAC will be built-to-spec and Offerors have the freedom to design the cabinet in a way that satisfies all requirements. 38) Are there any planned improvements/changes to the Towed Array PS or Receiver as part of the RFP.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Science Center (ESC) has received US Aid for International Development (USAID), Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (QFDA) funding to oversee a project focused on earthquake hazards risk reduction in the country of Burma (Myanmar).    In Fiscal Year 2012, USAID supported a needs and gaps assessment conducted jointly by the USGS and Burma's Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH).  In that assessment, DMH identified as a top priority the upgrade of their national seismic network, which currently does not meet key needs for hazard assessment and civil protection.   
The solicitation will be for an initial upgrade phase of the project which includes: instrumentation (sensors and data acquisition) to upgrade five existing seismic monitoring sites; network software and related hardware.  Initial training on operation of the new network equipment and monitoring protocols will be provided.   Options will be included for ongoing technical support and training to DMH personnel for up to three years.  Two additional options are anticipated, each for the upgrade of three additional sites (in the same manner as the first five sites).    See RFP for full details and specifications.
The contractor will have responsibility for deployment of the equipment at the monitoring sites and network center, installation and integration of the upgrades to the DMH network, as well as initial training (anticipated time frame approximately 3/01/2014  3/15/2014 for installation; 3/30/2014 for completion of functional checkout, troubleshooting, and  initial training).  It is anticipated that much of the troubleshooting and some initial or ongoing training could be conducted remotely via WebEx-like methods,  and software/hardware remote monitoring and troubleshooting could comprise the bulk of the technical support once the sites and network connections are established.   This will complete the base period effort.   
Following this, option periods would include ongoing field support and training (in one year increments) for an additional two years.  Additionally, an option line for a similar upgrade/installation of three additional monitoring sites will be included in the contract; as well  as a second, separate option line for three more sites.  The options are subject to continuation funding and availability of funds from USAID.    Anticipated timing of the 3 additional site options would be:  Option A1  approximately August 2015; and Option A2  approximately August 2016. 
All deliverables to be FOB Destination (Burma DMH); and all inspection/acceptance activities will be on-site in Burma.  USGS personnel will be present in Burma during installation and checkout.   Contractor will be responsible for all shipping and any necessary contractor personnel travel, visa, and import/export procedures.  It is anticipated that USAID and/or USGS will assist in arranging for duty free import of necessary equipment into the country, as well as any short-term storage of pre-positioned equipment necessary. 
The seismic equipment is considered commercial in nature, and therefore it is anticipated that the procurement will be conducted under the provisions of FAR Parts 12 (Commercial) and FAR Part 13.5 (Simplified Acquisitions  Test Program).    Anticipated RFP release date is 11/26/2013 with proposals due 12/20/2013.  Anticipated award date is 1/17/2014.   See attached details for full specifications, SOW, schedule, and proposal instructions.    Questions may be directed to the Contracting Officer at 916-278-9342 or dshannon@usgs.gov.    A pre-proposal conference is planned for 12/5/2013 at 1pm Pacific Time (via teleconference  no physical meeting will take place).

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking interested bidders for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Juvenile Fish Collection Channel Reservoir Side Fish Slot Lower Concrete Plugs. The construction will occur at the Lower Granite Dam in Garfield County, near Pomeroy, Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 238110 and the associated small business size standard is $14,000,000. <br /><br />This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify small businesses with the interest in and capability to accomplish the work. This is not a solicitation. <br /><br />1) A capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this scope, magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel. <br />2) A statement of your firm's bonding capacity. <br />3) A statement of your firm's business size and type. <br /><br />Submit this information to Jani Long, Contract Specialist, via email to jani.c.long@usace.army.mil. <br />Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM on December 9, 2013. <br /><br />Summary of Scope of Work: <br /><br />The reservoir side fish slots will be permanently closed. Closure is performed by using the existing fish slot screens and converting them into fish slot plugs. The screens will be removed from the slot by the Corps using their existing lifting beam and crane. Once the screens are out of the slot, they are turned over to the Contractor. The Contractor shall strengthen the existing screen legs, line the pervious areas of the screens, and fill the screen with concrete and reinforcing to create a solid plug. Approximately 378 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 plugs. <br /><br />Extend the new concrete above the top of the existing screen framework to facilitate sealing to the side walls of each slot. Incorporate new lifting hardware into the concrete fill and reinsert into the slot using a Contractor-furnished crane. <br /><br />After the screen plug has been lowered into the slot, deploy divers in the slot to the top of the screen plug. Release the lifting line and place backer rod sealing material in the gap between the plug and the walls of the slot. Push the backer rod material down about 6 inches from the top of the slot plug all around the perimeter. After the backer rod material is in place, the divers shall place a cementitious grout into the slot all around up to the top of the plug. Once the grout has been placed and has hardened, install reinforcing steel into the threaded couplers on the top of the slot plug. Pressure wash the side walls of the slot to remove any biological growth or film in preparation for placing a minimum of 5 feet of tremie concrete on top of the plug. Approximately 324 cy of tremie concrete fill is required for the 18 slots. <br /><br />Use a precast insert with an integral bottom form grouted into the bottom of the Wagner Horn slot for permanent closure. Approximately 54 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 slots (54 Wagner Horn openings). A roughly 6-foot tall, 30-inch diameter, precast plug of concrete with integrated reinforcing, bottom form, and grout injection ports is anticipated for this closure. Lower the existing Wagner Horn screen from deck level using the cables that currently attach the screen to the dam. After the screen is removed, pull a new high strength cable and sheave down into the slot conduits using the existing screen attachment cable. <br /><br />Divers shall remove the original screen and cable assembly, pressure wash the corrugated inside walls of the conduit, and attach the precast plug to the sheave. Use the new cable to pull the precast plug into the Wagner Horn conduit and seat the integrated form against the roof of the intake tube. The divers shall then pump grout through the form to fill the annular space between the precast plug and the existing interior conduit walls. Once the grout has sufficiently hardened, remove the injection ports from the forms and grind the area smooth while retracting the new cable from the abandoned sheave. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is July 2014 - March 2015. <br />

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 09 - 249 - Murfreesboro, TN is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This justification is provided to support contracting without full and open competition for subject requirement as authorized by the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.501.MSC Norfolk has a requirement to award a contract for the USNS ZEUS (T-ARC 7) to upgrade its High Precision Acoustic Positioning System 500 (HiPAP) from the HiPAP 500 to the HiPAP 501 version and to purchase the Conversion Kit 501 to 101 for the deep water/low frequency portion of the HiPAP system due to technical obsolescence of the existing HiPAP 500 system using other than full and open competition.<br /><br />Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Kongsberg Maritime, Norway, is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the existing High Precision Acoustic Positioning and Underwater Navigation System 500 (HiPAP) onboard the USNS ZEUS (T-ARC 7). The installed HiPAP 500 system is proprietary to Kongsberg Maritime. The Government was advised by Kongsberg, via a letter dated 9 October 2013, that the current system transceiver (500 version) is no longer supportable due to aging and non-availability of electrical components. To improve the reliability of the system and ensure that the vessel is capable of meeting mission requirements, the resource sponsor has requested that the existing HiPAP 500 be upgraded to the latest 501 version from Kongsberg Maritime. <br /><br />Replacing the entire HiPAP 500 would require extensive market research to determine what systems may be available, and which would meet the requirements for the vessel's operations with ROVs. Additionally, this would involve dry-docking the ship for an extended period of time to remove existing hull units and transducer heads and replacing the current HiPAP 500 system with an unknown new system. This would be significantly more expensive than upgrading the electronics of the HiPAP 500 transceiver and converting the deep portion/low frequency of the HiPAP 501 system with the HiPAP 101 system. <br />
