QUESTION AND ANSWER #2


The Department of Commerce published a market research announcement on February 23, 2007 entitled, D - - Market Research Department of Commerce Financial Management Modernization Project.  The reference number is MARKET-RESEARCH-02232007.  A second question was received.  The second question and the answer are provided below:


QUESTION #2:  If a small business intends on teaming with another vendor, how should the submission be prepared? Should the responses for block 7, with parts a-u, be strictly from the capabilities of the individual small business or from a teams capabilities that the small business leads as prime? How should blocks 10 through 14 be addressed?

ANSWER #2:  As stated in the first sentence of the market research announcement, the Department of Commerce is conducting market research in order to determine the capabilities of small businesses to provide services as a prime contractor.  Interested small businesses shall complete the template so that the information reflects the experience and capabilities of the small business as an individual entity.  If the small business would like to identify a potential subcontractor, the information shall be provided in response to block 15 of the template and a separate form may be completed that represents the experience and capabilities of the subcontractor.  If the subcontractor is also a small business, the Government may consider the information as an individual and separate submission.  If the subcontractor is a large business, the information will not be utilized to make a set aside determination.  The intent here is to review the information of the small business in order to determine its capability to prime the work based on its experience and capabilities in meeting the various requirements specified in the template in Attachment 1.  If the small business does not have experience or techniques to address a specific area, it shall be clearly stated in the response to the template completed by the small business.  In addition, the small business would need to address the obvious weakness in managing, as a prime, an area of the requirement in which it lacks experience.  As a result, Attachment 1A will be posted to the market research announcement.  Attachment 1A is a revision of Attachment 1 and shall be submitted instead of Attachment 1.  The basic difference is that Attachment 1A includes a fourth area in blocks 7a through 7u which requests information as to how the small business will manage an area of the requirement which it lacks experience, tools, or methodologies.  Blocks 10 through 14 are specific to the interested small business preparing the response.  It shall not take into consideration subcontractors.  It shall reflect how the small business manages fluctuation in the needs of the Government, the small business past performance as a prime contractor, the small business earned value management system and reporting (experience, acceptance by a cognizant Federal Agency, plan to be compliant, experience in Integrated Baseline Reviews incorporating technical assessments, etc.), the small business performance measures, and the small business commercial standards. These factors are considered essential to the small business and its business operations. Please note - The Government considers a plan to team with a subcontractor solely a plan in the same manner as "we can" and "we will" statements unless there is documentation provided to the contrary.

The date for receipt of submissions is not extended as a result of this posting.  The date for receipt of submissions remains 12:00 noon (Gaithersburg, Maryland time) on March 9, 2007.

<SUBJECT>70 -- COTS Enterprise Server Encryption
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-06-1011

<CONTACT>Patrice Coleman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-594-2016, Fax 410-965-9560, Email patrice.coleman@ssa.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for electronic/written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.  The Social Security Administration?s (SSA) Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operation (OTSO) is seeking sources capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for a product that can encrypt data at rest in an Active Directory (AD) based, Windows Server 2003 environment.  Currently, SSA stores users? individual and shared data on individual Windows Server 2003 file servers located at over 1,500 field offices.  Most of these devices also function as AD domain controllers and DNS servers, and OTSO does not desire to encrypt the operating system or Active Directory.  It is preferred to have the capability to integrate with AD for establishing access to files and folders.  The data types include documents created using standard COTS productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office, as well as proprietary applications developed by SSA.  The data also includes various database types, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL.   In some server configurations, data is stored in external disk arrays, or SANs.  Most of the Windows Server 2003 file servers in the SSA environment have the data residing on 3 separate partitions defined on an internal RAID-5 SCSI disk array.  Current estimates regarding the number of servers to be encrypted range from 1,475 to 4,200 pending the evaluation of data types and locations.  Separate groups will manage day-to-day operations versus encryption policies, so solutions which include separation of management tasks are desired.  The following specifications are the minimum mandatory requirements, but do not constitute all requirements: 1) COTS solution; 2) NOT a customized solution; 3) A Windows-based or web-based configuration and management tool; 4) Redundancy for key management; 5) Redundancy for continuation of operation in the event of a lost communication link to central office; 6) Capability and tools to encrypt existing data during a data migration; 7) Robust key archive and recovery; 8) Encryption of data on tape ? or capability to backup encrypted data to tape using native Windows backup tools or Veritas Backup Exec; 9) No physical token or user intervention required for remote rebooting of systems; 10) Ability to restore encrypted data to an alternate device quickly; 11) Ability to control windows administrator access to data.  Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to clearly demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency requirements, above. Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.  Pricing data is not required.  Respondents should refer to RFI-06-1011.  Only Electronic responses will be accepted and should be submitted by Friday, September 1, 2006.  Faxed information will not be accepted.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes.  MS Word is the standard word processing software. A solicitation is not available; therefore, written and/ or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Requests for information will not be honored. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact the Contracting Specialist listed below by e-mail.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT


(1)  GENERAL:  The Department of Commerce is conducting market research in order to determine the capabilities of small businesses to provide services as a prime contractor for the Department of Commerce Financial Management Modernization Project described herein. In order to qualify as a small business, an interested firm must be a small business under NAICS code 541511 and must meet the size standard of $23 million. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 19.102(b), the small business size standard is applied by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) which best describes the principal nature of the product or services being acquired and the associated size standard SBA established for that industry.  FAR 19.102(c) states, for size standard purposes, a product or service shall be classified in only one industry, whose definition best describes the principal nature of the product or service being acquired even though for other purposes it could be classified in more than one. The following websites provide information pertinent to the small business size standard:  http://www.sba.gov/size, http://www.naics.com/sba_sizestandards.htm , and www.arnet.gov/far.   To be considered a small business, your firm must be of a nature which primarily engages in writing, modifying, testing, and supporting software to meet the needs of a particular customer. Information about the NAICS code can be retrieved from the following url:  http://www.naics.com/censusfiles/ND541611.HTM and http://www.naics.com/faq.htm#q1.   The second criteria for being considered a small business is your firm's annual average revenues over the last three years cannot exceed $23 million.  FAR 19.101 provides a definition and circumstances for applying this standard.  In general, annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. For the purpose of this definition, gross revenue of the concern includes revenues from sales of products and services, interest, rents, fees, commissions and/or whatever other sources derived, but less returns and allowances, sales of fixed assets, interaffiliate transactions between a concern and its domestic and foreign affiliates, and taxes collected for remittance (and if due, remitted) to a third party.  The average over the last three years cannot exceed $23 million.


The Department of Commerce is embarking on the next evolutionary stage of its Financial Management.  The Department's strategic vision is aligned with the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) goals of standardization, consolidation and optimization in achieving and sustaining financial management excellence.  Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive financial management modernization initiative focused on deploying the next generation of strategic, process, technology, change management and human performance components.


The original implementation strategy was to allow each bureau to establish unique business rules, implement an instance of the system based on these rules, and run the system on the bureau's server.  Over time, this model has proven inefficient, ineffective, costly, and time-consuming. The new business model, which the Department has already begun to execute by consolidating bureau instances and servers, is intended to address these deficiencies, and allow the Department to achieve the goals of the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB), including facilitating strong internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other stewardship activities; reducing cost associated with implementing and operating financial management systems; standardizing systems, business processes and data elements and providing seamless data exchange between the Department and other federal agencies.  


In furtherance of this new direction, the Department is considering seeking contractor support for developing a comprehensive strategy and roadmap/blueprint to assess feasibility of analyzing alternative options for financial management support in achieving financial management excellence. This roadmap is anticipated to provide the overarching architecture around standardizing, consolidating and optimizing the Department's business processes, administrative systems and technologies, user interaction and usability, data centers, security and integration components.  This analysis is anticipated to include an assessment of Shared Service Providers capabilities in providing all four categories of service: technology hosting and administration, application management, business process services and system implementation services as outlined in FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance.  The Department is anticipated to undertake the broad scope of process re-engineering, systems implementation and deployment, change management, security management and integration activities necessary to achieve its vision.


As a part of finding and implementing the right solution the Department would require a continuation of current requirements such as both current system maintenance support and overarching support during transition to migrate from its current financial management state to its optimal future state, including all design, architecture, integration, and deployment activities as well as sustaining this future state, including continual business improvements to achieve most efficient organization (MEO) status.  It is critical that the contractor develop, manage, and execute a comprehensive solution that includes maintaining current applications in parallel while performing transition. 


PLEASE NOTE: An interested small business firm which is also a Shared Service Provider or FSIO (JFMIP) Compliant Federal Financial System Vendor would be precluded from offering their software product to the Department of Commerce during any resulting competitive process due to this requirement potentially creating an Organizational Conflict of Interest in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5.


(2) INCUMBENT:  There is no prior contract for the requirements as identified herein.  Some of the services were provided by Systalex Corporation, 1901 Research Blvd, Suite 240, Rockville, Maryland under contract number CM130104CQ0006 which was awarded on July 26, 2004.  Services provided under contract number CM130104CQ0006 included developers, testers, help desk, data warehouse, and Oracle portal services.


(3) ATTACHMENTS:  This announcement contains two attached documents:  Attachment 1 provides instructions on the preparation of a response to this market research and a template for the response; and Attachment 2 is a general description of the system.  Interested small businesses are encouraged to review the attachments thoroughly.  They are also encouraged to activate the email notification feature of FedBizOpps in order to receive notification of any additional postings for this announcement.  In addition to the attached documents, interested firms are encouraged to become familiar with the FSIO website at http://www.fsio.gov/fsio/fsiodata/ in order to understand the requirements of Federal agencies to meet the standards, performance measures, and compliance requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget task force.  


(4)  INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PREPARATION OF A RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET RESEARCH.  Interested parties shall provide a response in accordance with Attachment 1 - Instruction on the Preparation of a Response to the Market Research.  


(5)  PROPOSED STRATEGY:  The Government intends on reviewing all submissions received in response to this market research announcement.  Firms may be requested to submit additional information in the form of a face-to-face meeting with a panel of Government representatives.  The Government assumes that market research will be performed during the month of March 2007.  Upon completion of the market research, the Government anticipates developing requirements, performance measures, inspection and acceptance procedures, as well as other areas of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government anticipates conducting a presolicitation conference on or about May 2007.  If an RFP is issued, it will be performance based and include performance measures.  This is your opportunity to provide input.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for electronic/written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.  The Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operation (OTSO) is seeking sources capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for a product that can encrypt data at rest in an Active Directory (AD) based, Windows Server 2003 environment.  Currently, SSA stores users’ individual and shared data on individual Windows Server 2003 file servers located at over 1,500 field offices.  Most of these devices also function as AD domain controllers and DNS servers, and OTSO does not desire to encrypt the operating system or Active Directory.  It is preferred to have the capability to integrate with AD for establishing access to files and folders.  The data types include documents created using standard COTS productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office, as well as proprietary applications developed by SSA.  The data also includes various database types, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL.   In some server configurations, data is stored in external disk arrays, or SANs.  Most of the Windows Server 2003 file servers in the SSA environment have the data residing on 3 separate partitions defined on an internal RAID-5 SCSI disk array.  Current estimates regarding the number of servers to be encrypted range from 1,475 to 4,200 pending the evaluation of data types and locations.  Separate groups will manage day-to-day operations versus encryption policies, so solutions which include separation of management tasks are desired.  The following specifications are the minimum mandatory requirements, but do not constitute all requirements: 1) COTS solution; 2) NOT a customized solution; 3) A Windows-based or web-based configuration and management tool; 4) Redundancy for key management; 5) Redundancy for continuation of operation in the event of a lost communication link to central office; 6) Capability and tools to encrypt existing data during a data migration; 7) Robust key archive and recovery; 8) Encryption of data on tape – or capability to backup encrypted data to tape using native Windows backup tools or Veritas Backup Exec; 9) No physical token or user intervention required for remote rebooting of systems; 10) Ability to restore encrypted data to an alternate device quickly; 11) Ability to control windows administrator access to data.  Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to clearly demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency requirements, above. Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.  Pricing data is not required.  Respondents should refer to RFI-06-1011.  Only Electronic responses will be accepted and should be submitted by Monday, September 1, 2006.  Faxed information will not be accepted.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes.  MS Word is the standard word processing software.
