(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.

Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically. The solicitation number for this requirement will be: SPRTA1-18-Q-0332.

<DESC>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) program safeguards U.S. agriculture and natural resources against the entry, establishment, and spread of economically and environmentally significant pests, and facilitates the safe trade of agricultural products.
<p>Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula) was initially detected in the United States in 2014 in Southeastern Pennsylvania. It has since spread through over 3,000 square miles within Pennsylvania. USDA believes the accidental introduction into the United States was through egg mass movement accompanying cargo shipment(s) from Asia. Since its initial detection in Berks County, SLF has spread through the adjacent regions and into Fredrick County, Virginia. If left unmitigated, continued expansion into adjacent areas will likely occur. As a result, the USDA is contracting for the herbicide and insecticide treatments of Ailanthus altissima, also known as "tree of heaven", a known host of Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula) on priority properties in the state of Virginia.</p>
<p>The intent is to award one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for a period of three years. This procurement is a small business set-aside. The appropriate NAICS code for this solicitation is 561730 with a small business size standard of $7.5 million. Solicitation number 12639518R0026 will posted on or about April 12, 2018.

<CONTACT>Eubank, Aaron
<DESC>This project is a Multiple Award Solicitation for Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Heavy Equipment Rental with operator for various site work on projects for the maintenance, rehabilitation or restoration of various habitat types at 3 refuges making up Willapa National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The area of coverage is Willapa National Wildlife Refuge (Pacific County, WA), Julia Butler Hansen Refuge for the Columbian White-tailed Deer (Wahkiakum County, WA & Clatsop County, OR) and Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge (Wahkiakum County, WA & Clatsop County, OR).  Only the US Fish and Wildlife Service will be authorized to use these IDIQ contracts. 

Awards resulting from this solicitation will be made in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, to responsible small business concerns that submit a fair and reasonable price.  (Refer to Section I, Clause I.2, 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside). Work to be performed under the IDIQs will be under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: 238910 Site Preparation Contractors.   Contractors will be expected to provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personnel services necessary to provide and operate heavy equipment to facilitate the completion of various habitat restoration and management activities.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $2,500 - $300,000.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods. Total contract amount (including options) will be $2.5 million.  The government will likely award no more than 3 IDIQ contracts.  

The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 15.101-2).  In using this LPTA approach, the government seeks to award to those offers who give the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  Evaluation criteria for this LPTA procurement will be detailed in the forthcoming solicitation.  All successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $500.00 for the full contract performance period of the IDIQ contract.  Upon issuance of task order(s) exceeding $500.00, the minimum guarantee will be deobligated from the IDIQ contract. With few exceptions, the government will compete future requirements among the awardees.  The maximum amount of orders issued annually could be up to $500,000. 

To be considered for evaluation, applications from firms must consist of a completed SF-1449, along with other documentation as cited in solicitation package number 140F0118Q0037. The government intends to post the complete solicitation to FedBizOpps on or around March 15, 2018 with responses due to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service two weeks after the solicitation is posted.  Solicitation number: 140F0118Q0037 may be viewed through FedBizOpps or FedConnect. No further notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.   Prospective contractors shall be registered in ¿The System for Award Management (SAM)¿ database prior to award of a contract at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.¿   Questions may be directed to Aaron Eubank at (503) 231-2101. 

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any quote/proposal preparation costs.

<DESC>BACKGROUND<br />The Forest Service is in need of cutting dead and burned trees within the Little Valley Project area. The trees were burned during the 2016 Little Valley fire and are in danger of falling onto private property and creating a future fuels hazard. The adjacent private property has had extensive salvage efforts performed. There are live trees in the general area, and there is concern that post-fire pests will affect the survivability of live trees in the surrounding area. The dead trees on site will be cut and bundled in designated staging areas to protect existing infrastructure on private property, as well as reduce the risk of additional trees dying due to post-fire insect affects, and to mitigate a future fuels hazard. <br />SCOPE OF CONTRACT<br />The mandatory work item in this solicitation includes cutting designated trees, whole tree yarding them to designated staging areas, and decking the cut trees.  <br />All work items are located on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Carson Ranger District. The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the area specified. All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services will be performed per contract specifications. <br />LOCATION DESCRIPTION<br />The general projects area is approximately 15 miles southwest of Reno, Nevada in Washoe County. The general location is shown on the included vicinity map. A detailed unit map is also included showing the areas that trees need to be removed. <br />The project location is located in T16N, R19E, Section 16. Work may begin as soon as mid to late July. <br />Road access into the unit is through private property, accessed off of Franktown Road in Washoe Valley, Washoe County, Nevada (detailed on unit map). The contractor may need to negotiate with the private property holder to refine the details of accessing the unit.

<CONTACT>Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer, Phone 2042765439, Email miguel.diaz@nih.gov
<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology (LOP) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, a reagent rental contract for use of rental equipment with supporting equipment product supply and to provide a preventative and corrective maintenance component for equipment from BD Biosciences of 2340 Qume Dr., San Jose, CA 95131.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.501(a)2(i) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5 million.  Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  It will be awarded as an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a 36-month period of performance.  It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Flow Cytometric immunophenotyping is standard medical care for patients with hematolymphoid malignancies and therefore a necessary clinical service for NCI patients.  The Laboratory of Pathology (LP) Flow Cytometry Laboratory is the only NIH laboratory providing standard diagnostic flow cytometric evaluation of minimal residual disease in neoplastic specimens.  In addition, the LP Flow Cytometry Laboratory provides unique and highly complex flow cytometric testing mandated on numerous NCI protocols and unavailable at any commercial laboratory or any single academic pathology laboratory.</p>
<p>Because the LP Flow Cytometry Laboratory has a very high specimen volume-to-resources ratio, care must be taken to accommodate a maximum number of daily specimens.  Testing demand can exceed FTE resources on occasion and patient specimens above the maximum per FTE may be refused to avoid increased error rates. With reagent rental, the two (2) BD-owned LWAs can support a higher maximum number of specimens by processing specimens independently allowing FTEs to perform additional testing.  New clinical protocols mandating flow cytometric testing are supported with sufficient robotic and FTE coverage. Now, as new protocols requiring Flow Cytometry immunophenotyping are scheduled to begin in the next fiscal year, meeting the increasing demand for flow cytometric testing requires Follow-on of the adjusted IDIQ to insure continued use of the two (2) existing BD-owned LWA robotic systems compatible with the existing NIH-owned BD equipment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide use of rental equipment with supporting equipment product supply and to provide a preventative and corrective maintenance component for equipment in the Laboratory of Pathology / Flow Cytometry Laboratory by BD Biosciences.  The rental equipment (FACS Lyse Wash Assistant equipment-LWA) is a commercial item capable of preparing clinical protocol specimens for analysis with proprietary features to insure consistency of cell yield with minimal loss.  The performance characteristics and standards have been established and proven to be beneficial to the Government's need for consistency and quality.  The supporting equipment product supply (antibodies, quality control material and instrument reagents) have been in use with ongoing clinical protocol research and must continue to be utilized to prevent variation in research findings.</p>
<p>The supply of commercial antibodies, quality control material and instrument reagents are specific for use with the BD Bioscience rental instrument and are critical components for providing the Government with continued analysis of ongoing clinical research protocol specimens for Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) in the Laboratory of Pathology.  Compatibility requirements with existing systems include BD FACSCantoII Flow Cytometer and FACS Supply System.  Compatibility of continued reagent rental instrumentation with existing BD FACSCantoII Flow Cytometers has been evaluated and qualified for testing for many clinical trial research protocols.   Any change in instrumentation or reagents would involve evaluating new testing for the entire antibody inventory against the manufacturer's specifications incurring interruption of patient care, staff retraining and SOP creation for approval without a guarantee of reproducible results critical to ongoing clinical protocols.  This acquisition will provide use of existing rental equipment, equipment supplies and maintenance to ensure ongoing clinical research protocol outcome is consistent.  Use of new or alternate equipment, supplies or maintenance service from other sources will delay patient testing and impact research result outcome.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM ET, on April 24, 2018.  All responses and questions must be via email to Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer at miguel.diaz@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification through SAM.GOV and have Representations and Certifications filled out.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Nikon Instruments Inc., 1300 Walt Whitman Road, Melville, New York, 11747 to procure a custom Microscope Lexan Enclosure for CO2 Microscope Cage Incubator, #77057437, that includes an OKO lab full enclosure system with gas mixer for 100% CO2 with one (1) each of the following items: Temperature Control Unit - #77057343, Touch Screen Controller - #77057333, Gas Chamber for Ti-S-E or Ti-S-ER + Mad City Labs Piezo Z-Stages - #77057435, Optional KOEHLER Lid - #77057434, CO2 Controller Bold Line - #77057348, Air Pump Bold Line - #77057342, Vibration Free Humidifying Module - #77057436, and sample holders with one (1) each of the following items: Multi-Well Plate insert for H201 Incubation System - #77057528, Double 35mm Petri-dish holder for H201 Incubation System - #77057431, 1"x3" Chamber Slide Holder magnetic for H201/H301 Incubation System - #77057463, Lab-Tek 1"x2" Chambered Cover Glass Holder Magnetic - #77057441, and Lab-Tek II 1"x2" Chambered Cover Glass Holder Magnetic - #77057461. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm-fixed price type of contract.</p>
<p>Delivery to Rockville, MD 20852 approximately 60-90 days after receipt of award.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Immunogenetics performs live cell imaging experiments using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and STORM super-resolution imaging with our recently purchased Nikon TIRF STORM4 microscope. The intent of this purchase is to procure custom Microscope Lexan Enclosure for CO2 Microscope Cage Incubator that includes an OKO lab environmental control system specifically designed to integrate with the Nikon TIRF STORM4 microscope already located the lab. This will allow the microscope to perform both live cell TIRF and super-resolution experiments with a full wrap around enclosure that is absolutely necessary to stabilize the microscope base from mechanical drift due to fluctuations in room temperature over time lapse experiments. Incubation at 37&deg;C, with humidification and 5% CO2 is critical. The OKO lab environmental control system is the only system that has been vetted by Nikon Instruments to perform to the specification of the microscope. The following features for the environmental control system are required for the experiments performed in this laboratory: Full enclosure with unencumbered access to all microscope control elements and peripheral equipment, enclosure to protect the microscope base from room temperature fluctuations, a system to provide 37&deg;C incubation, system to provide humidification, system with 5% CO2, the system is to have minimal vibration in the water bubbler to not impeded super resolution experiments, and the system is to have specimen holders that accommodate 35 mm dishes, standard slides, and LabTek brand chambers. Nikon Instruments Inc., is the sole manufacture of the Nikon TIRF STORM4 Microscope, which to purchase another microscope enclosure that is not compatible to the microscope could lead to the Nikon TIRF STORM4 microscope not performing to its full capability, and the experiments to falter.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources who can provide the same or similar equipment may submit a response that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-18-1900893) to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 3:00 pm eastern standard time Monday, April 23, 2018. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The Government intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Kilgore Flares Company, LLC, 155 Kilgore Drive, Toone, Tennessee, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, industrial mobilization; engineering, development, or research capability; or expert services, and statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This proposed procurement is for the MK 58 MOD 1 Marker, Location, Marine manufactured in accordance with government specifications.
