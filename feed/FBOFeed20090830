<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of
Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), NCI conducts intramural research in
areas related to nutrition and cancer aimed at lowering human cancer risk. One
focus of NEB
research is esophageal cancer, especially esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established cause of squamous cell
cancers of the cervix, vulva, anus, penis, tonsil, and oropharynx, but its role
in the etiology of ESCC remains unclear.<sup> </sup>Serological studies have
reported ORs of 0.8 to 14.6,<sup> </sup>and PCR-based studies of case series
have reported the prevalence of HPV DNA in ESCC tumor tissue to range from 0
percent to 100 percent.<sup><span>&nbsp; </span></sup>With
the new potential to prevent HPV-related diseases by vaccination, it is
especially important to determine if this virus is, in fact, involved in ESCC carcinogenesis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Possible sources of variation in serological study results include
differences in study design, differences in the serological tests used, and
true variation among populations.<span>&nbsp; </span>To
minimize variations in study design and serological tests is to do one large
study in diverse populations using standardized methods and tests.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, the NCI recently joined the InterSCOPE
Study, a collaboration of ESCC
case-control studies from both high- and low-risk populations, to evaluate the
association of HPV seropositivity and ESCC risk in approximately 2,000 cases
and 5,000 controls from Australia,
China, Iran, South Africa,
Europe, and South America.<span>&nbsp; </span>All testing will be done by a single lab with
a single assay, a Luminex multiplex assay that can identify antibodies to the
L1, E6 and E7 proteins of the 8 high risk HPV types that are the most prevalent
in cervical and oropharyngeal cancer (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58).<span>&nbsp; </span>All test results will be adjusted for
smoking, alcohol consumption and other covariates in a standardized
manner.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The purpose of this collaborative study is to measure the association
between the above HPV serological markers and risk of ESCC in a standard way in
both high- and low-risk populations from around the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>This will be the largest and most definitive
serological study of this hypothesis ever performed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this procurement is to conduct
the needed serological tests on the serum samples contributed to the
collaboration by DCEG/NCI, including (a) 300 ESCC cases and 300 controls from
the Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies&rsquo; Case-Control Study in Shanxi,
China, and (b) 300 ESCC
cases and 571 controls from the GEMINI Case-Control Study<span>&nbsp; </span>in Golestan,
 Iran .</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Specifically, the contractor shall perform Luminex multiplex serological
testing for antibodies to the major capsid protein L1 and the oncoproteins E6
and E7 of the following eight high risk mucosal HPV types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35,
45, 52, and 58, on 1471 serum samples provided by the Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall perform this testing
using the same methods that it currently uses to test all serum samples from
all studies collaborating in the InterSCOPE Study.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Infections and Cancer Program (F020) at the Deutsches
Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), under the direction of Dr. Michael Pawlita, is the
only major research laboratory with extensive experience conducting the desired
Luminex multiplex HPV serological assays.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is the laboratory that is currently testing all serum samples from
all other studies collaborating in the InterSCOPE Study; and thus is the only
source that can supply the services required in this procurement.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

plans to procure, on a sole source basis, the brand name BD LSR Fortessa Special
Order System (SOS) from BD Biosciences; 2350 Qume Dr.; San Jose, CA 95131-1807</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for
acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use
simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5.<strong><span>&nbsp; </span></strong>The North American Industry
Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500
employees. The delivery time, including installation is forty-five (45) days
after award. Contractor shall provide installation and training.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
FACS Core 37 Facility supports the CCR scientific research community by
providing instrumentation and expertise to perform state-of-the art flow
cytometry. The laboratory currently houses 3 flow cytometers and 3 cell
sorters.<span>&nbsp; </span>The most recently-acquired flow
cytometer is an LSRII (BD Biosciences) that was installed in October, 2003.
This was purchased to allow the core lab users to perform newly-developed and
complex experiments that could not be run on the older instruments.<span>&nbsp; </span>The FACS Core 37 Facility is used by over 200
scientists each year, and the demand for this instrument now exceeds its
capacity.<span>&nbsp; </span>The new LSR Special Order
System will be outfitted with 4 lasers and 14 fluorescence detectors allowing
the NCI to double the core laboratories instrument capacity as well as expand
the range of applications.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
BD LSR Special Order System (SOS) is a flexible, reliable, and sensitive
state-of-the-art digital flow cytometer. It has a gel-coupled quartz cuvette,
reflective optics, and fiber-coupled PMTs. The design allows for
customer-specified configuration. The unique salient characteristics of the<strong><span style="color: purple;"> </span></strong>LSR
SOS are:<strong><span style="color: purple;"> </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: blue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">3 basic lasers (blue, red,
     violet)</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Supports a 355 nm UV laser</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Space for the addition of
     a fifth laser if needed</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Unique design that allows
     the laser beam to be transmitted in air rather than a fiber optic cable</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Increased detector
     capacity (blue-red-violet-UV, 6+3+3+2) that will manage the increasing
     complexity seen in flow cytomeric experiments</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Runs on the same software
     platform (FACS DiVa) as the existing LSRII</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Automated setup and
     monitoring of daily quality control</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Compatibility with
     software programs currently used in the FACS core</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">30 x 36 inch size</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The LSRII is the only benchtop flow cytometer that is
equipped with the number and wavelength of lasers required for projects
analyzed in the FACS Core 37 Lab. The 3 basic lasers and their 12 detectors
will be needed for identification of complex subsets of cells. In addition,
many projects in the NCI are using special dyes excited only by the 355 nm UV laser
to identify potential cancer stem cells. This instrument will support a 355 nm
UV laser and will have space for the addition of a fifth laser if needed. A
number of other projects require use of different probes unique to the UV laser
to study cell function and DNA content. The LSRII has a unique design that
allows the laser beam to be transmitted in air rather than a fiber optic
cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>UV cannot be adequately
transmitted by fiber optic and for this reason the few other multi-laser
research cytometers on the market cannot be outfitted with UV, only
&lsquo;near-UV&rsquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>This new LSRII also has an
increased detector capacity that will manage the increasing complexity seen in
flow cytomeric experiments.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition,
it is important that this multi-user cytometer is run on the same software
platform (FACS DiVA) as the existing LSRII so users can use the two
interchangeably when needed.<span>&nbsp; </span>This LSR
Special Order System has a 30x36 inch footprint, less than half the size of the
older LSRII.<span>&nbsp; </span>This small size is crucial to
fitting the instrument in the existing laboratory.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<AWDNBR>AG-7482-C-09-0005
<DESC>Intent to Award a Sole Source Requirement

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Centers Servicing Unit, Ft. Worth TX, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source with Meteor Communications Corporations (MCC) 22614 66th Avenue South, Kent, Washington 98032.  

MCC currently owns and operates the four meteor burst master stations located in Bozeman, MT, Tipton, MO, Mt Gilead, OH and Stoneville, MS.  The assets include at each location, building, antenna towers, one Omni-directional transmit antenna, 8 receive antennas, MCC-520 computer, receivers, frequency synthesizer, pre-amplifier, final amplifier, and the meteor burst communication software and other miscellaneous hardware items required for operation.  These four facilities will be purchased from MCC.   All of the hardware and software operating at these four facilities are proprietary to MCC.  With this purchase, the NRCS will have a license to operate the meteor burst communication equipment.  

NRCS requires these four meteor burst master stations in order to obtain the remote station data in the central and eastern United States.  It is believed that there are no other companies that have in operation meteor burst communication technology or master stations that are operating within the United States which uses the MCC proprietary operating system.  All of the remote station radios operate against this proprietary operating system and were manufactured by MCC.  
  
A firm fixed price contract is anticipated and shall be awarded. 

It is the Government’s belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement in a timely and cost effective manner. It is the Government’s intention to solicit and negotiate with only this source.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notice to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days from the synopsis publication date. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. This information can be emailed to judith.weber@ftw.usda.gov.  Responses will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
