<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Nation Centers for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price supply contract to Bioreclamation IVT, 123 Frost St Ste 115, Westbury, NY, 11590-5034 . This contract will be for 120 days from time of award.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p><br />Bioreclamation specializes in processing human fluids from normal and diseased patients. Bioreclamation not only collects blood products such as serum and plasma, but they also collect samples such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from normal and diseased patients. In particular, Bioreclamation has in their catalog both serum and cerebrospinal fluid collected from the same individual at the same time. Bioreclamation is the only vendor that can provide the specific requirements for donor selection and this is a crucial aspect for our method development process as we are trying to determine if there are correlations between lipid species in cerebrospinal fluid and serum when analyzed in the same patient.</p>
<p>These special requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; Bioreclamation collect samples such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from normal and diseased patients for both serum and cerebrospinal fluid collected from the same individual at the same time which is require din order for us to assess our method.<br />&bull; Bioreclamation has a large enough inventory of archived samples where specific populations are represented in large enough number so the analytical data that is generated is statistically significant. For example, race, gender, cardiovascular disease diagnosis, Alzheimer diagnosis, Type-2 Diabetes diagnosis, and medication. Bioreclamation is compliant with CDC IRB requirements, cleared by the CDC IRB office. Other vendors do not have the required size of inventory and/or IRB compliance. The statistically significant representation of target populations and the IRB compliance is crucial in case the data, either as method development work or human subject research, will be published in peer reviewed journals.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 325414 Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Bioreclamation. Bioreclamation is the only source available to provide the specimens that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov. <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>

<p>The Activity will work to (a) identify investments by building a pipeline of &lsquo;investment-worthy projects, (b) encourage investments by working with financial institutions and assist in the design and roll-out of green financing mechanisms, and (c) build a Community of Practice for Sustainable Landscapes Finance in order to foster knowledge-sharing and learning across countries and to address systemic issues that block the development and financing of low emissions land use management businesses.</p>
