<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2510-01-645-8966 - Frame Section, Structure, bought in accordance with Oshkosh Defense, LLC (75Q65) part number 4156131. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 129 units shipping to (W25G1U) Susquehanna, PA 17070. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 10/23/17. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 150 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Upload proposals through DIBBS is the preferred method or submit e-mailed proposals to the Contracting Officer at: Alonzo.Burris@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

<DESC>The Department of Justice is seeking attorneys to litigate debt collection cases for various Federal agencies. Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice (DOJ) contemplates award of a single contract with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The DOJ launched the Private Counsel Program following the passage of the Federal Debt Recovery Act of 1986 which first authorized the use of private law firms for this purpose. The Debt Collection Management Staff manages the program with legal oversight by the United States Attorney's Offices at the district level. The program is currently running in 19 districts nationwide, with further expansion planned. This procurement is strictly limited to attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the District of Puerto Rico. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based on firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. Other direct costs and/or material costs may be reimbursed on an actual cost basis. The anticipated period of performance for the contract will be a base year with up to four option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov and is anticipated to be released on or about December 3, 2018. Amendments to the solicitation, if any, issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and register in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

NORTH CHARLESTON, SC. 29405<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507–2(d), insert the following clause:
Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and
(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as “contractor”) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms “contract,” “contractor,” and “Contracting Officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507–1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<BR><BR>Equipment Condition New Equipment ONLY where it's marked OEM; Remanufactured items only where it's marked Remanufactured.
