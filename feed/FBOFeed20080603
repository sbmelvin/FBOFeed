<DESC><p>The 319th Contracting Squadron intends to issue a solicitation for snow and ice removal services at Grand Forks AFB, ND. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services, except as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) as Government-furnished property. Performance shall be to the standards in the contract as well as all local, state, and federal regulations. The solicitation will result in a firm fixed price requirements contract with a base year and four one-year option periods. The base period of performance will be from 1 Oct 08 through 30 Sep 09. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488490, and the small business size standard is $6.5M. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business set-aside. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 30 June 08 via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO). Paper copies of the solicitation will not be mailed. Prospective offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation; prospective offerors are encouraged to register for notification through FBO. All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) to be eligible for award. Registration requires a DUNS number and may take up to three weeks to process. Instructions are available at the CCR website.
<p>Additionally, the 319th Contracting Squadron requests informational responses in regards to specific industry standards and commercial practices within the snow/ice removal industry. The Government is exploring avenues to decrease costs without sacrificing service and/or capability. Included in this notice is a draft PWS for the service that the Grand Forks AFB intends to solicit offers for. The draft PWS is included for offerors to evaluate and potentially provide feedback on specific requirements which are viewed as excessive and unnecessary. Any suggestions on how to change or relax requirements/standards to better align with the commercial marketplace and industry standards are appreciated. Upon evaluation by the acquisition team, responses may be considered and used to refine PWS requirements/standards. In addition, the Government requests your response to the following:</p>
<p>1)What is the commercial threshold for responding to a snow event? GFAFB's draft PWS requires a response after &frac14;" of accumulation. If this were increased to &frac12;" or 1", in terms of percent of costs, what might the cost savings be?</p>
<p>2)Para 1.2 "Snow Hauling" of the draft PWS directs snow hauling within 24 hours after the snow event. What are typical timeframes or standards within the commercial market for this requirement? Does this requirement exist in the commercial marketplace?</p>
<p>3)What method of commercial contracting and/or pricing options is most prevalent? (Pricing options - per push, per event, per inch, or per season) Are there any other pricing options besides the ones listed?</p>
<p>4)Do snow removal providers simply base their per season prices on historical averages? If so, from what source is this data collected?</p>
<p>5)One requirement Grand Forks AFB is considering is pre-pricing out snow/ice removal per square foot of parking lot and per mile of road. This pre-priced item will then be used during contract management to price out modifications for adding or deleting roads/parking lots as necessary. Is this a viable option and/or compatible with current market practices?</p>
<p>Responses and recommendations received by 4:30 PM CST on Tuesday, 17 June 2008 will be evaluated prior to issuing the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to increase the Estimated Contract Value of theAerospace Testing and Facilities Operations and Maintenance (ATOM) contract. Amodification reflecting this increase will be issued for the remaining period ofperformance which ends July 31, 2009. NASA/ARC intends to increase the estimated contract value of the ATOM contract,NNA04BA85C, which was awarded through full and open competition to Sverdrup Technology,Inc. (now Jacobs Technology Inc.) in June of 2004. This increase is required due tounexpected Wind Tunnel and ArcJET Complex repairs/upgrades as well as an increase intesting projects. NASA is using the authority of other than full and open competition, 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification is based on Jacobs unique expertise with the currentupgrades, the testing in progress, as well as their ability to provide continuity ofservice while the follow-on is being recompeted.  Award to another source at the sametime the current contract is being re-competed, would result in substantial duplicationof cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition aswell as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 11, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Ms. Gonzalez not later than 4:30 p.m. local time onJune 9, 2008.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<SUBJECT>Repair of Georgian Coast Guard Patrol Vessel
<SOLNBR>HSBP1008Q1811
<CONTACT>Arthur S Cooper III, Contracting Officer, Phone 214-905-5533, Fax 214-905-5746, Email Arthur.Cooper@dhs.gov
<DESC>US Customs & Border Protection (CBP) is providing assistance to the Coast Guard of the Republic of Georgia as follows. 

A former “Grif” type patrol vessel (P-205) that has been reconfigured as an “Orbi” class vessel for the Georgian Coast Guard and was put back into service in early 2007 with new engines, generators, electronics, etc. This vessel is slightly under 25 meters in length and has an aluminum hull. Unfortunately, some faulty workmanship was performed which must be corrected/resolved along with some other issues, as follows:

1.	Current vessel’s fuel distribution system appears to be galvanized, threaded pipe with Teflon tape sealer in the joints.  All system joints are leaking, and only minimal support is noted. A single fuel-water separator services all of the engines and generators. System most likely should be replaced entirely.
2.	Reduced power from starboard main engine (Caterpillar C18-E with ZF-665 transmission) was noted 11/2007 but both main engines now appear to have reduced power (2080 rpm max for port engine, 2060 rpm for starboard engine as of 3/08). Engines maxed out at 2132 and 2131 rpm (starboard and port respectively) and hull had exceeded 30 knots in sea trials prior to delivery, 1/2007. Starboard main engine recently shut down unexpectedly while underway for observation and testing purposes and would not restart – Recurring air leak in the fuel distribution system was suspected cause. [Engine has since been restarted following purging of air from fuel lines].
3.	Port and starboard main engines each currently have at least 1 chromed sub-standard elbow installed for engine cooling system and perhaps other non-standard parts. 
4.	Port and Starboard generators (Caterpillar C-4.4 38ekW) shut down inexplicably while at sea; Suspected problem is air leak in the fuel distribution system. 
5.	Toilet pump is inoperable (Jabsco); Motor runs but no pump action noted. 
6.	Main Power Panel: A suspected failing/defective part (coil or transformer) is not understood in terms of function. Installation of the part appears to be temporary in nature and has a loose component. 
7.	Currently, the ship has a separate auxiliary 12v battery for certain electronics and accessories, which is not connected to the existing 24vdc chargers for engine cranking batteries. A temporary charger for the 12v battery is located in the galley/mess area is in use and is not permanently installed.
8.	Control Panel for fire pump is located near and below deck hatch and receives too much weather exposure from open hatch (crew currently has the panel wrapped in plastic to shield from weather).
9.	Shower liner/deck is torn – needs replacement.
10.	Pilothouse windows (larger forward and side windows) leak in weather (rain and/or spray come into pilothouse interior) and were installed using non-stainless steel crews which are now rusting.  Main power transformer in the engine room appears to make more noise (hum) than expected, even with minimal load.
11.	Transformer blower makes excessive noise.
12.	Hull has some barnacle and algae infestation since launch 10/2006.

Issues listed above are to be investigated and resolved in accordance with best current industry standards (i.e., repaired, replaced, etc.). Additional minor work will also be required on this vessel as well. The work on the engines and generators will require extensive experience in the repair and servicing of contemporary Caterpillar engines and generators. The Contractor will be required to have the necessary computer-based diagnostic software and relating equipment to service the main engines. The successful Contractor must have access to and be familiar with the Caterpillar Marine Analyst Service Handbook which provides substantial guidance regarding the installation and operation of Caterpillar engines and generators.

Ideally, CBP would like to have the repair work performed in Georgia or at a suitable facility nearby (in the interest of reducing costs) but all reasonable offers will be considered in an effort to obtain the work required to return this vessel to fully operational status. Partnering with firms in Georgia that have facilities and/or equipment needed for the work of this contract is suggested as a possible solution (Note: There is a shipyard in Poti, Georgia). Alternately, the Georgian Coast Guard will permit repairs to be performed on their base at Poti if desired but the successful Contractor will have to provide its own tools/equipment/etc.

The solicitation will be issued shortly. It will contain the complete work requirements and include available drawings. 

Interested firms are encouraged to respond to this notice indicating that they are interested in this project and providing a brief statement of their capabilities to perform the work required. Firms that respond to this notice will be added to the Solicitation Distribution List and provided either a copy of the solicitation or notice of how to acquire when the solicitation is issued. Interested firms must have operational and reliable email service in order to perform the work of this project as email is the preferred method of transmitting written documents (i.e., as opposed to conventional mail, fax, etc.).

Attachment 1 contains photographs of the vessel and various equipment installations that are relevant to the work of this contract. Additional useful information follows.

<DESC><p>Notice of Intent to negoiate a sole source contract withSkagit System Cooperative for&nbsp;the office of NOAA,&nbsp;Northwest Regional&nbsp;Office of National Marine Fisheries Service&nbsp;located in Seattle, Washington for spawning ground survey Marblemount hatchery area for spring Chinook salmon.</p>
<p>Spawning grounds survey/s will be conducted in streams that are likely to contain hatchery spring Chinook Strays. Surveys will begin after July 15,2008 in the lower Cascade, and in other areas after Chinook are seen on the spawning grounds in the Cascade. Normally, the snouts of CWTed fish are sent to the state tag lab in Olympia, WA, where it can take months for them to be processed and the data made available. In order to quickly determine the age and origin of tagged fish samples during surveys, the SRSC team will extract and read the tags. This will most likely be about 50 -I00 tagged snouts, The CWT results, along with mark and scale information, will be used to determine the composition of the Chinook that were samples. Using the redd counts from spawning ground surveys, the SRCS team will estimate the total number of Chinook that spawned in the surveyed areas by multiplying the number of redds constructed by 2.5. They will then apportion that number into hatchery, wild, marked, unmarked, and age groups and release stage by multiplying the Chinook spawner number by the relative percentage of each attribute in the carcass samples. Using those component breakouts, the hatchery rack return, the wi Id escapement number, and the SRSC team can caleu late the percentage of the hatchery return, by return year and by brood year, that stray to the spawning grounds, the percentage of the wild spawners that are hatchery origin fish, and the total escapement of hatchery springs.<br />The objectives are: to tag-sample at least 10% of the Chinook spawners in the vicinity of the Marblemount Hatchery during the spawning timing of spring Chinook salmon. Estimate the number of hatchery stray spawners by age and release stage, and estimate the total number of strays to within a c.v. of + 15%. Calculate the hatchery stray rate, and compare it to the rate estimate of2006 and 2007. Sample sufficient Chinook carcasses in the vicinity of the Skagit Marblemount Hatchery (i.e., the lower Cascade, upper Cascade, and mainstream Skagit upstream of the Sauk). Estimate the number of Skagit hatchery Spring Chinook that spawn in the wild by age and release stage. Using the number of hatchery strays spawners, and the rack return to Marblemount Hatchery, calculate the stray rate, overall and by age and release stage.</p>
<p>The Skagit River System Cooperative (SRSC) provides natural resource management services for the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe and the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. On behalf ofthese two sovereign nations, SRSC works to actively improve fisheries management within their usual and accustomed fishing areas. These areas include the Skagit and Samish River basins, and were ceded to the United States through treaties signed in 1855. Fisheries management carried out by SRSC includes harvest and hatchery management, research, environmental review, habitat restoration, and a range of other activities. The Salmon Recovery program at the Skagit River System Cooperative provides the technical analysis for tribal and state fisheries managers used to negotiate annual salmon fishing plans and long-term salmon recovery and management plans. This is accomplished by developing and negotiating annual forecasted abundances of Skagit River system salmonids. Salmon Recovery also proposes and oversees the research needed to develop these plans and responds to public misconceptions about Indian fishing.<br />Based on the United States Chinook Technical Committee (USCTC) review and recommendation, the Commissioners recommended a series of proposals for funding, including a proposal from the Skagit River System Cooperative (SRSC) to document the staying rate of Chinook salmon returning to the Marblemount Hatchery on the Skagit River. This information will improve escapement estimates to CTC standards and improve the data used in analytical methods that support Chinook salmon abundance based management under the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The SRSC conducted a pilot study in 2006 that found that the undocumented straying rate was a significant problem and this experience will allow them to design an effective project for the 2008 season. The Skagit River Chinook stocks are listed as endangered under the ESA and the SRSC holds the required permit to conduct research on them. The project leaders (see below) are experts in their field and their collective experience and the other factors identified above are required for this project to be successful, justifying a sole source contract for this work to the Skagit River System Cooperative (SRSC).</p>

<SUBJECT>Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Operator's Curriculum
<SOLNBR>N61339-08-R-0011
<CONTACT>Gregory Joseph Dougherty, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (407) 380-8419, Fax (407) 380-8399, Email Gregory.Dougherty@navy.mil - Michael J. White, Contracting Officer, Phone (407) 380-4085, Fax (407) 380-8399, Email michael.j.white@navy.mil
<DESC>The LCAC is a non-self sustaining amphibious Air Cushioned Vehicle (ACV), used to transport up to 60-tons of equipment and/or troops, from ship to shore at speeds in excess of 40 knots.  The primary mission of LCAC is to conduct high speed, ship-to-shore, over the beach operations in support of Marine amphibious forces. After being launched from the well deck of amphibious assault ships, the LCAC can transport equipment, personnel and weapon systems to the beach from over-the-horizon standoff distances.
The original LCAC design was based on a 20-year life cycle.  Current vehicles are approaching the end of that service life.  A Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) has been created to prolong the service life of approximately 60 vehicles for an additional 10 years.  During SLEP, vehicles will be updated to incorporate the latest performance, communications, and navigation enhancements, as well as meet new lift requirements. 

Operations personnel consist of a three person starboard cabin crew.  Crew position titles are Craftmaster, Engineer, and Navigator.  Each crew member is responsible for separate job duties and functions.  During actual operation, the crew also performs coordinated, collective team duties.  Individual and team job duties and tasks are to be included in the revised curriculum.  Revision to the current operations curriculum is required due to the addition of SLEP hardware and software components.  It is estimated that 25 percent Craftmaster, 50 percent Engineer and 70 percent Navigator legacy curriculum information needs to be replaced with updated SLEP objectives and content.  The current course is unclassified and is delivered using a power point and paper based curriculum with minimal graphic support via Instructor-Led Training (ILT).  The existing courses use the FMT, Device 20G6, and the actual LCAC.  Schoolhouse training courses currently exist for legacy LCAC Operations and Advanced Qualifications Training (AQT) along with corresponding Navy Course Identification Number (CIN) and course length and Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC).  The Operations courses are taught at Expeditionary Warfare Training Group – Pacific (EWTGPAC) in Coronado, California and Expeditionary Warfare Training Group – Atlantic (EWTGLANT) in Little Creek, Virginia (VA).  Each of the current legacy courses encompasses 17 weeks.  AQT training is conducted at either Assault Craft Unit 4 (ACU4) in Little Creek, VA or ACU5 in Camp Pendleton, California (CA).  The current legacy AQT course encompasses eight weeks.

The associated Statement of Work provides complete details regarding this procurement.  Small Business participation is encouraged and will be mandatory for Large Business offerors.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Genedata, Inc. 1601 Trapelo Rd, suite 350, Waltham, MA 02451, for the  renewal of a   license for Genedata Screener Software for theperiod of one year.  NCCT requires a database and tools that must have the following capabilities: (1) Flexibility in building templates for calculation of raw plate-based data; (2) Visualization of plate-based data for QC analysis; (3) Robust concentration-response curve fitting routine;(4) Ability to link chemicals in sample plates to assay results; (5) Operational database supporting mass storage of data and analysis results. A large amount of data for ToxCast will be generated at the National Institutes of Health, Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC). Their unique approach to HTS, termed quantitative HTS (qHTS), tests all chemical in concentration-response format. This presents unique challenges in dat QC and management. Curve fitting routines must be extremely robust to routinely and efficiently handle thousands of test results. This is an absolutely critical step in the analysis of collaboration with NCGC. In addition, other products have laborious procedures required to build specific templates for calculating raw data for HTS assays. Because ToxCast will be acquiring data from a number of different sources and for a large number of different assays (hundreds), the ability to easily build templates for data calculation sophisticated visualization of plate-based data, an interface to link sample information with assay results, and an operational database sufficient to meet the long-term requirements of the ToxCast Program. The EPA has identified Genedata, Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106(B)"Only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<CONTACT>Kirsten Stanley, Phone 202-767-3090, Fax 202-767-6197, Email kirsten.stanley@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for systems that can warn aircrew of hostile fire from small arms, anti-aircraft artillery (AAA), and rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) directed at Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft.  The systems tested will be limited to those that provide real time warning of man-portable surface-to-air and air-to-air threats and that are capable of displaying MWIR imagery to the aircrew for enhanced situational awareness in visually degraded conditions.  Systems must be at technology readiness level (6 or greater) and be compatible with the AN/AAR-47 installation.  The HFI processor may be a prototype processor that is not yet within the AAR-47 constraints.  Metrics for evaluation include, but are not limited to, probability of indication, false indication rate and required sensor frame rates.  The test will be a ballistic weapons live fire at Aberdeen Proving Ground anticipated in November 2008.  Equipment will be mounted on a platform suspended via a crane approximately one hundred feet above the ground.  It is expected that at least two sensors, a data recorder and a real-time processor will be used.  All sensors will be located on a common GFE mounting structure along with a GFE LN-251 Inertial Navigation System.  The government is also interested in evaluating the performance in the presence of urban background clutter through use of pre-recorded airborne data with inserted flash and tracer signatures.  The government will provide updated MWIR flash and tracer signature models such that the contractors can develop algorithms and software ahead of the test. 

A complete Statement of Work (SOW) will be available as part of the solicitation.  It is anticipated that multiple Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts will be made as a result of the solicitation with approximate periods of performance of six months.   NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs.  Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.  The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Synopsis:Provide an enterprise-wide Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) with RIS/HIS for the Veterans Integrated Service Network 20 (VISN 20) that will both replace our current cPACS as well as provide PACS capability in facilities that are currently only operating with VistARad.  The contractor will provide all hardware, software, installation, training and ongoing full maintenance support.  VISN20 seeks to implement a VISN-wide PACS that is integrated with a single datacenter located in Vancouver, WA. VISN 20 is comprised of multiple physical sites, comprising nine (9) main organizational entities.  The care facilities are located at the following locations:  1.	Portland, Oregon (includes Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington)2.	Roseburg, Oregon3.	White City, Oregon4.	Vancouver, WA (Data Center)5.	Puget Sound (includes Seattle and American Lake, Washington)6.	Spokane, Washington7.	Walla Walla, Washington8.	Boise, Idaho9.	Anchorage, AlaskaEach sites' RIS (Radiology Information System) is VistA (Veterans Information Systems & Technology Architecture).  Four of the facilities also have an existing cPACS installed at their location - provided by a commercial PACS provider.  VISN 20 seeks to implement a VISN-wide PACS, such that any image obtained at ANY VISN 20 site is easily accessible from any other VISN 20 site and such that a list of prior imaging exams for any given patient includes imaging exams performed at all VISN 20 facilities.We have formal working relationships with a number of private academic institutions and military bases: for instance, the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) is a medical affiliated facility with Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU).  There are PACS to PACS MOU's in place to securely and directly (i.e. not on CD but through direct fiber and network connections) transfer data between the applications/organizations.  We need to be able to continue these relationships.  In addition to these affiliations, we have a need to send images to private sector Radiologists working in groups as contractors with the VA. Finally, some VA radiologists and clinicians may need access to the PACS images in their homes (via home telerad). This procurement is unrestricted. All bidders must be registered in CCR at http://www.ccr.gov  to be eligible for award. NAICS 423450 applies-size standard is 100 Employees. The estimated dollar value of this procurement is $13,000,000. In order to receive e-mail notification of amendments, you must register in FedBizOpps to Receive Notification of amendments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to contract with small business firms to perform Environmental, Construction and Operations & Services 2009 (ECOS09).  The ECOS09 contract will be a tool for AFCEE to provide government customers' access to competent small business contractors to satisfy environmental, construction, operations and services requirements.  The ECOS09 contract offers a broad range of environmental restoration and construction; traditional minor construction, repair, and demolition; and operations and services.  The operations and services include: environmental conservation, compliance, pollution prevention and clean-up activities, ordnance removal and disposal, and energy management.  Operations and services do not include fulfilling the normal, everyday duties and taskings expected to be accomplished by government personnel assigned to a civil engineer flight at an Air Force installation.  Work ordered under the contract will be that arising from, driven by, or in support of the worldwide AFCEE mission.   

The current ECOS (Environmental Construction and Operations & Services) contract SOW will be revised, but scope shall essentially remain unchanged (current ECOS SOW can be downloaded at:  http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ECOS/default.asp ).  Based on responses and comments, the ECOS09 SOW will be developed and posted at a later date on the AFCEE ECOS09 website: http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ECOS09/default.asp 

Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website: http://www.ccr.gov/ )


BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.  AFCEE anticipates awarding indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the following characteristics:
•	Anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years of performance
•	Small Business Set-Aside North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 562910 – Size Standard (500 Employees)
•	Multi-award – estimated to be five to eight contractors. The Government reserves the right to award approximately 8 contracts or none at all
•	$350M-$500M program ceiling range – with no option to increase the program ceiling.  Collective amount of all Task Orders (TO) issued against the basic IDIQ contracts cannot exceed the overall program ceiling amount
•	Each contractor is guaranteed minimum award $2,500.00 
•	Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Materials (T&M), and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contracts
•	Anticipated range of a standard ECOS09 TO is $100K to $2.5M
•	Requirement to support implementation of both a service contract and a construction contract rate structure (Service Contract Act, Davis Bacon)

The government anticipates using the Price Performance Tradeoff source selection procedures found in FAR 15 and supplements.  This technique initially determines technical acceptability of an offeror’s proposal and subsequently conducts tradeoff between past performance and cost/price.

Offerors forming teams to accomplish all work found in the ECOS09 SOW are reminded to review FAR 52.219-14 (b)(1), “Limitation on Subcontracting” which calls out “at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern” the 50% expenditure will include not only the small business prime offeror, but the first-tier small business teaming subcontractors as well. 

After award of the basic contracts, selection of individual contractors for each Task Order (TO) will be dependent upon contractor specific technical and/or management capabilities, proximity to the proposed work site, availability of labor and resources, contractor’s performance on prior TO’s, schedule driver and cost.  The government reserves the right to compete individual TOs to comply with FAR 16.505 and DFARS 216.505-70 or if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.

The ECOS09 Acquisition team needs feedback from industry and from government personnel.  Your comments are important and your recommendations will be a key component in AFCEE developing an effective acquisition strategy.  We’ve devised a series of questions/topics below for you to consider – other comments regarding the government’s course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged.

QUESTIONS:
1.  Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of the program addressed above?   If not, please explain why?

2.  The current ECOS contract SOW will be revised, but scope shall essentially remain unchanged (current ECOS SOW can be downloaded at:  http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ECOS/default.asp ).  Can you offer any improvements to the ECOS SOW?  Do you have sufficient experience with these services such that an evaluator could assess your capability?  If not, please explain why.  If so, what evidence could you provided on the capability to effectively and efficiently execute multiple, concurrent scope requirements in geographically disperse locations?  

3.  The anticipated range of a Task Order (TO) under ECOS09 is $100K to $2.5M.  What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?  What maximum capacity of work can your firm reasonably manage while assuring effective program/project implementation and maintaining quality products?  

4.  In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Protege, Indian Incentive, etc.)?  What is the extent of your participation in these programs? Do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)? 

5.  As stated above the Government anticipates using Price Performance Tradeoff (PPT) source selection process.  Could you identify any benefits if full trade off procedures were used?  In your view, what criteria would distinguish one firm’s capabilities from another?  Please explain.

6.  AFCEE may evaluate world-wide capability, experience, and past performance as part of any solicitation that might result from this inquiry.  Is your company able and willing to perform efforts worldwide?  If your capability is limited to an area, please explain what area. 

7.  In your view, how many simultaneous, geographically dispersed task orders should a firm need to show to demonstrate the ability to effectively manage worldwide ECOS09 scope capability and to handle surge requirements?  How can capacity be most effectively demonstrated to the Government under a solicitation (e.g. scope/dollar value, numbers of task orders, both, etc.)?

8.  Would your firm participate in this acquisition with other firms as teaming members or joint ventures?  What other teaming opportunities do you see for this acquisition?  How would you demonstrate depth and breadth of team experience in accordance with the scope requirements?

9.  AFCEE is planning to host an Industry Forum/Pre-solicitation Conference in the near future.  What format for this event do you think would be most beneficial?  What topics would you like to hear discussed and how many people would you want to send?
  
10.  In your view, how should fair opportunity and head-to-head competition be conducted at the task order level?  Would you support a down-selection mechanism?  How would you recommend any down-selection be handled? 

11.  Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) under contract to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME Program Safeguard Contractors [PSC]).     These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function.

The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare.

The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to     (1) coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); (2) provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders, including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; (3) provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; (4) develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs;     (5) establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations.

In order to be considered for this requirement, an offeror:

a. must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS.     There are no exceptions to this requirement; offerors which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration. 

b. must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days);

c. must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame;

d. will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier;

e. must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors;

f. must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and 

g. must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes.


Business Information:     Please provide the following in your response:

a.       DUNS # 
b.       Company Name 
c.       Company Address
d.       Current GSA Schedules, if applicable, appropriate to this Sources Sought
e.       Do you have a Government approved accounting system?     If so, please                                                                                                                                                                                     
identify the agency that approved the system.
f.       Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran                                            owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).                                      All offerors must register on the CCR located at                                                           
                            http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.     
g.       Company point of contact, phone, and e-mail address 
h.       Point of contact, phone, and e-mail address of individuals who can verify       
the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.


Responses must be submitted no later than August 22, 2007.     They should clearly reflect the respondent's ability to meet the requirements included in this notice.     Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.     Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of their submissions.     Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential small business set-aside. The maximum number of pages for submission is 10.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal (RFP), or other solicitation and in no way obligates CMS to award a contract.     The sole intent is to obtain capabilities for set-aside and procurement planning purposes.       


CMS intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the PDAC MAC. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 4 option years. CMS anticipates the release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, which will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<DESC>Nuclear Weapons Effects Simulator Test Support 

Background:  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) operates the Technical Evaluation Assessment Monitor Site (TEAMS) which is located on Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), New Mexico and has been in operation for over six years.  TEAMS is a low-cost, premier, multi-use site where preliminary evaluation, assessment, demonstration, training, fielding, and integration are performed for developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf systems to detect, combat, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive threats for DTRA, DOD, and non-DOD agencies and their contractors. 

The TEAMS facility is located at KAFB. The site is 24 acres, completely fenced and secured with limited access and 24 hour monitoring.  The site has office spaces, conference rooms, and on-site storage available.  Both 50 Hz and 60 Hz electrical power is available for testing US and non-US systems and for testing systems destined for deployment OCONUS..  The site has water, sewer, paved roads, parking, and three US standard railroad sections (spurs).  Seaboard containers, 8, 20, and 40 foot are available on-site.  TEAMS stores and has immediately available radiological sources with access to medical sources from an off-site organization.  

TEAMS supports the 377th ABW Security Forces with several radiation monitoring detectors and support network at several KAFB access points.    Currently, TEAMS provides logistical support of the system and training for KAFB Security Forces personnel.

Description: The scope of the effort is to provide test support and facility operations to DTRA’s TEAMS facility for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) detectors and sensors.  This consists of handling low-level radiological sources and explosives, assessing and evaluating detector technologies and systems, evaluating the ability of the TEAMS facility to support customer requirements, and analyzing, interpreting, reporting, and storing test results.  Additionally, the scope calls for providing support for ensuring the availability of TEAMS’ infrastructure and the programs supported at TEAMS and for TEAMS to provide Research and Development (R&D) and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) testing of detectors and sensors for use by the Department of Homeland Security, Domestic Nuclear Detector Office, and Department of State.  Work will be performed primarily at Kirtland AFB and Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Contractors may be required to support testing at the Nevada Test Site, NV or at other locations worldwide.  The contractor may be required to support CBRNE operations 24 hours a day, 7 days a weeks.

Objective:  The objective of this effort is to obtain a team of qualified personnel for day-to-day maintenance of the TEAMS facility, the resident radiological sources, and all on-site equipment (i.e. hand-held and stationary nuclear detectors).  The contractor shall monitor the KAFB nuclear detectors and provide support to the ABW Security Forces, and provide a knowledgeable resource for test customers.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide a team to conduct R&D and IV&V testing on CBRNE detectors and support CBRNE operations.  

The technical requirements of this task are as follows:  

- Facility Infrastructure Availability

  - Provide access to site, site security, and presence.
  - Maintain inventory (radiological sources, etc.).
  - Monitor base nuclear detectors (normal duty times and 24/7 on-call).
  - Ensure availability and usability of all site assets.
  - Respond to data requests from test customers and government agencies.
  - Interface with Test Customers to schedule and plan testing, training, or provide support.

- Test Support (R&D and IV&V)
  - Level 1: Provide test engineers/scientists and technicians when required.
  - Level 2: Provide full test team – Test Director to technician as required.
  - Data collection, documentation, reporting, and archiving.

- Operational Support
  - Level 1: Provide support of on- and off-site CBRNE operations which may be 24/7 (i.e. Operational Command Post for movement of radiological materials).
  - Level 2: Provide Operational Team for on- and off-site CBRNE operations.

Respondents (contractors) are requested to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the technical requirements outlined above.  SOCs are limited to a total of five (5) single space pages. Submit responses electronically to rudy.chavez@abq.dtra.mil and david.lojewski@abq.dtra.mil by close of business on June 18, 2008.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.
The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential qualified 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and Small Business firms for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Environmental Planning and Engineering Services for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Executive Order (EO) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions.  The preponderance of work to be assigned under this contract will be NEPA documentation in support of proposed infrastructure-related actions related to SHIP HOMEPORTING ISSUES.  The geographic area covered by this contract encompasses the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic's area of responsibility (AOR) and the adjacent waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The preponderance of the work on this contract is anticipated to occur within NAVFAC Atlantic's AOR, which includes the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Europe and North Africa. Taskings, however, could be assigned anywhere in the world.  After review of the submitted responses, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The Government intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type contract with an estimated total amount not to exceed $31,000,000 for all years.  The contract term will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional one year option periods. Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services, and the small business size standard is $4,500,000.
The documents to be prepared under this contract include:  Categorical Exclusions (CATEX), Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) under NEPA, as well as Environmental Reviews and Environmental Studies under EO 12114.  The preponderance of work to be assigned under this contract will be NEPA documentation in support of proposed infrastructure-related actions related to Ship Homeporting issues.  However, other tasks may be assigned.  Some examples of taskings could include homeporting of aircraft, new construction, renovation, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions and demolitions.  General guidelines for preparation of the NEPA documentation are contained in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations (40 CFR part 1500 et. seq.) and Navy Instructions as published, 32 CFR Part 775 and OPNAVINST 5090.1C.   Guidance for preparing EO 12114 documents is contained in OPNAVINST 5090.1C, Appendix E.  In order to complete these documents, some of the following related studies and services may be required:  (1) Air Conformity Analyses under the Clean Air Act; (2) Wetland delineation and mitigation plans; (3) Cultural resource surveys (both architectural and archeological); (4) Coastal Zone Management consistency determinations; (5) Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultations, Biologic Surveys and Biological Assessments; (6) Community Impact Studies; (7) Environmental Justice Analyses; (8) Traffic Studies; (9) Water quality studies to include chemical and physical analysis of dredge material and bioassays; (10) Storm Water Management Studies; (11) Noise impact studies/modeling; (12) Toxic and hazardous waste studies; (13) Public Involvement Strategies; (14) Life Cycle Cost Analyses; (15) Land Use Compatibility (LUC) Plans; (16) Natural Resources Surveys; (17) Translation services for CATEX/EA/EIS and Public Notices; (18) Range hazard analysis; (19) At-sea acoustic analysis; (20) Marine Resource Assessments; (21) Marine Mammal Density estimates (22) Letters of Authorization and Incidental Harassment Authorizations;  (23) Essential Fish Habitat Assessments; and (24) Military Base Development Requirements.
The Government will evaluate sources capabilities from responding firms on the following: 
1.    Specialized Experience:  Firms and consultants, if proposed, will be evaluated in terms of their past experience with regard to the preparation of the above listed environmental documents and related studies and their knowledge of environmental regulations pertaining to this type of work.
2.     Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the staff assigned to this contract for the type of work addressed in Evaluation Factor #1:   Firms will be evaluated in terms of the staff's experience and active professional registration, and the capability to provide experienced, qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.
3.     Ability to perform the work to schedules and capacity to accomplish up to 3 concurrent taskings per year.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the staff's projected workload during the contract period.
4.     Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should demonstrate long term business relationships and repeat business with Government and private customers along with appropriate points of contact.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.
5.     Quality Control Program:   Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and disciplined coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.
6.     Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).   Firms will be evaluated on their location with respect to the general geographical area of the contract and their knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction practices of the area of the contract.   This evaluation factor applies to the office that will perform the work and not general office locations that will not be performing work under this contract.
7.     Volume of Work:   Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.
8.     Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:     Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 76.78%.   Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)  16.03%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) - 14.37%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) - 3%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 3%; and HUBZone Small Business  1.35%.
If the firm is considering entering into a teaming arrangement, provide the name of all teaming partners, the anticipated type of teaming arrangements, address the specific services each member will provide, and include applicable experience for each member.  For other than bundled requirements, your firm may be able to joint venture with one or more small businesses and not be considered affiliated as long as each member of the joint venture is considered Small under the applicable NAICS code (13 CFR 121.103(h)(3)).  The limitation on subcontracting would apply to the cooperative effort of the joint venture not each individual member (13 CFR 125.6(i)).
Interested firms should submit a brief capabilities statement (no longer than 20 double-sided pages) to the contracting office, demonstrating their ability to meet and execute the requirements as set forth above.
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms submitting responses shall present their information in a matrix format showing contracts they have performed.  The matrix shall show the 10 most recent projects which demonstrate an ability to meet the qualification criteria listed above.  Provide the contract number, contract type (i.e. fixed price, IDIQ, cost reimbursement, etc.) project value, contract value, and point of contact with phone number and/or email.  Indicate whether the work was performed as a prime or a subcontractor and the percentage of work your firm performed.  List key personnel who participated on the projects and what their responsibilities were. Provide the firms ability to meet the qualifications described above relative to the firm/team.  Provide the firms business size relative to NAICS code 541330.  Responses are due no later than 4:00 p.m. EST, 30 June 2008.  Firms responding to this advertisement are requested to submit only 1 copy of the qualification statement. Responses should be mailed to the following address:

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide statewide evidence-based education interventions (using The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign materials) to expand the role of primary care in the prevention and treatment of heart disease risk factors, and the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome and heart disease among women ages 40 to 75, with specific emphasis on blood pressure control, tobacco cessation, lipids control (including triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL, total cholesterol), diabetes control (including testing, monitoring, nutrition counseling, and foot care), weight loss or control, and symptoms of heart disease.

The information from this market research will help the Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women’s Health (DHHS/OWH), plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  DHHS/OWH WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign was developed and launched in 2007 by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women’s Health (DHHS/OWH), the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and supported by several primary care organizations to determine the effects of a structured educational program to improve provider knowledge and self-assessed skills. The Heart Truth Professional Education materials were based on the 2004 and now 2007 AHA Evidence–Based Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease in Women.  Results of a pilot program among 1200 health care professionals have shown significant increases in knowledge about women and heart disease and interest in incorporating these materials into practice after exposure to the materials. At pre-test, family practice physicians were significantly more knowledgeable than OBGyns, and RNs were significantly less knowledgeable than other groups. After exposure to the Heart Truth Professional education program materials, there was a 40% improvement in scores, although RNs were still significantly less knowledgeable than family physicians. All Heart Truth materials were deemed helpful for communication with patients, and 72% of the providers said they would use them in their practices. The problem is that these materials have not been widely distributed to primary care physicians in the United States.   

Primary care settings are one of the key points of access to screening, assessment, prevention, early intervention, referral, and treatment for women at risk for heart disease. Most women do not seek regular care from cardiologists but do visit a primary care provider or come into regular contact with other medical caregivers regularly. In fact, about 85 percent of women in the U.S. see a physician at least once a year.  Despite this seemingly obvious connection, heart disease prevention, screening, diagnostic referral, and brief behavioral treatment interventions are not consistently provided in primary care settings. Primary care providers have not begun to recognize the clinical symptoms that lead to the diagnosis of heart disease in women, an integral part of patient care. 

Part of this gap can be accounted for by lack of women’s heart disease knowledge and practical skills among primary care providers. In a survey of 500 randomly selected physicians in 2005, Mosca et al. (circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/111/4/499)  found that only 60% of primary care physicians (PCP’s) and Obstetricians/Gynecologists (OBGyns) were aware of the American Heart Association Evidence-based Guidelines for Cardiovascular disease in Women. Of those aware, PCP’s were twice as likely to report incorporation of the AHA Women’s Guidelines into their practice than OBGyns (39% vs. 20%, respectively). In addition, 28% of PCP’s and 43% of OBGyns were willing to seek additional training to allow them to better engage in preventive health treatments for CVD in women.     

Furthermore, limited research has examined effective ways to educate and encourage practicing primary care providers to address heart disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment of women in their standard care routines. However, important lessons have been learned from several successfully tested tobacco cessation, breast and cervical cancer screening interventions in women in the primary care setting (Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T.).  Also lacking are practical incentives for primary care providers to focus on heart disease in women.  

It is unclear the extent to which the current lack of attention to heart disease in women in primary care settings is related to factors such as the complex nature of heart disease and its associated risk factors; lack of awareness of efficacious tools for screening, assessing, preventing, or treating women and heart disease in primary care settings; lack of health care provider training in women and heart disease; and/or organizational, management, time, or financing 
issues, including limited reimbursement for care. The new Medicare coverage for heart prevention services and their appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes needs to be widely circulated among primary care providers: especially the one-time physical exam and EKG, cardiovascular screening to measure LDL and HDL cholesterol, smoking cessation counseling, diabetes self-management and medical nutrition training, diabetic shoes and supplies, including testing strips and insulin, and medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol(www.cms.hhs.gov/mlnproducts/downloads/mps_guides_web_061305.pdf). 
 
The goal of this initiative is to increase knowledge, counseling skills, and treatment of women according to the AHA Evidence-based Guidelines for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Women. This Request for Proposals (RFP) seeks to build on recent efforts to reduce the knowledge gap on women and heart disease among primary care providers through dissemination of The Heart Truth Professional Educational materials. In addition, the Office on Women’s Health within Department of Health and Human Services (OWH) seeks to expand the availability and delivery of evidence-based risk factor and diagnostic interventions in primary care from lessons learned from other evidence-based programs.

 
The objectives of the Primary Care Partnerships program include:
1.	Increase the number of primary care providers in high risk states who receive CME on The Hearth Truth Professional Education materials
2.	Improve knowledge and preparedness on the AHA Guidelines for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Women in high risk States
3.	Increase the number of medical and nursing journal articles on The Heart Truth information 
4.	Increase the number of primary care physicians offices in high risk states using risk assessments and office reminder systems for women and heart disease. 

For the purposes of this RFP, the term high risk state is intended to include the top 15 states with the highest heart disease mortality rates for women (2001-2003): Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Michigan.

The term primary care setting is defined broadly to include all outpatient clinics (public and/or private) and private practices that offer office-based general medical care. These clinics and practices are staffed by physicians—often with other health care providers such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, or behavioral health practitioners—typically within the following categories:  internal medicine, general medicine, family practice, and gynecology. Not included in this RFP are the following care settings:  emergency rooms, acute care facilities, and chronic care facilities. Primary care providers refer to all of these professionals.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Arizona Water Science Center (WSC) of Tucson Arizona has a requirement for software development services.  This software service will include a revision of existing USGS software called Alternate Place Entry (APE).  This APE program was initially developed for a specific use out of the San Diego Water Science Center and was designed to streamline data collection, processing and storage in GWSI of new ground-water sites.  The APE program was found to be a good start on meeting the needs of the Arizona WSC, but needed major revisions to meet project specification for data collection, processing, and storage.  The APE program is written in the C# programming language; therefore any interested party must be fluent in C#.  The APE application has an integrated component for GIS data called ArcEngine by ERSI software, and the development environment and an understanding of this software component are required to perform these enhancements.  Another required component is a PDF builder that will produce completed reports in a PDF format.  This software revision must completed with four to five months from date of award and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.
Interested parties having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at sklingler@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The VA Northern Indiana Health Care System is seeking the services of a qualified Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firm to provide all labor, material, equipment, and expert supervision necessary to design the following for the VA Medical Center located at Marion Indiana:  The AE will need to develop the required paved bus/auto unloading area allowing convenient access to the west entrances of B-172. The existing sidewalks currently located there will need to be removed, the elevation changed as required for the busses to turn in off the drive from either direction and unload. The unloading area will need to be designed to allow for passenger vehicle parking around its perimeter, primarily for handicapped patient's vehicles.  The 520 ft. long concrete drive leading to the north, will need to be altered to allow passing of buses etc. in opposing directions of travel by either adding increased width or possible complete replacement. Provision will need to be made for a revised drainage system along the drive and in the unloading areas and adjacent parking areas.  Landscaping and a new system of side walks to other more distant parking areas will be required.  The actual building entrances will need to be redesigned providing wider access to accommodate large size wheel chairs. The entrances will need to utilize oversized power operated doors and the immediate interior of the building  will need to be revised to incorporate air locks with a  second set of doors to reduce heat loss and discomfort of patients inside the atrium.  Roadway signage and street marking shall be detailed on the designs as well.  Interested firms are required to submit: two (2) copies of Standard Form (SF) 330 (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms), Part 1 and Part 2 to  VA Northern Indiana Health Care System, Attn: Robert O.

<DESC>A – INTRODUCTION

1.	This is a call for White Papers through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Armament Center, 46 Test Wing, 46 Range Support Squadron, under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2)(i) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research white papers/proposals.  White papers submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.

B – INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:

1.	This notice serves as a call for White Papers; AAC/PKE will not issue a separate solicitation. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, the BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a white paper. The white paper must contain as a minimum: Title, Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude Cost, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email, Task Objective, Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables and should be three to five pages in length. Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. If invited by the Government to submit a proposal, it is not an assurance that a contract will be awarded. White papers submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. Based on evaluations of the white papers, a Request for Proposal(s)(RFP) will be sent to the Offeror(s) that meet the criteria. The RFP will require the Offeror(s) to submit a full technical proposal, including a contractor statement of work, and a cost proposal. 

a)	SUBMISSION DATE: Offerors shall submit their White Papers so that they arrive no later than 3:00 P.M. Central Local Time on 18 July 2008. Offerors shall submit their white papers electronically to Dana Alexander at the contact information listed above.  

b)	For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard to be considered a small business is 1000 employees (NAICS 541330).
c)	The estimated amount of funding available for this effort is $300,000. AAC/PKET anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract that will fund a study that will look at capabilities outlined in Section C of this BAA.  
d)	Cost proposals are neither required nor desired when submitting White Papers.
e)	Foreign firms will not be permitted to participate as prime contractors in this procurement.
C- Effort Summary

1.	The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the prospective technical/functional capabilities desired by the Government.   These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly innovative white papers that have the potential to dramatically shift existing paradigms.  Further, these topics are not intended as an all-inclusive list.  These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest.  However, any submitted white paper must be grounded in achievable goals.

a)	The Government is interested in facility technologies that provide some or all of the following capabilities for world wide applications. 

•	Provide protection for equipment and personnel from potential threats commonly found in a stateside and an overseas environment. The white paper will need to identify the threats that this facility will provide protection from i.e. conventional weapon attack, chemical or biological attack etc.
•	Protection from severe weather conditions; the white paper needs to identify what conditions the facility will be able to withstand i.e. hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes etc.
•	Ability to accommodate personnel and their office space. The white paper shall demonstrate what the working environment inside the facility will be, how many people the facility will accommodate and how much space will be dedicated to office space.
•	Ability to provide shelter for a range of military equipment to include but not limited to: ground mobile vehicles, individual fighters, and large cargo transports.
•	The Government may desire more than one facility in close vicinity to each other: the white paper shall demonstrate what the options for a cluster of facilities would be. 
•	The white paper shall identify what efficiencies in construction, utilities and maintenance will be utilized in the design of this facility.
D – Evaluation Criteria   
1.	The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, for White Papers are technical merit and importance to agency programs. 
2.	The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, for technical proposals (Step two) are technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. 
3.	Evaluations may take up to 60 days from receipt of White Paper to complete. Award of any contracts resulting from this BAA is anticipated to occur in FY08 or FY09. 
E – Additional Information
1.	If selected for award, you must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/) in order to receive the award. If you are not in the CCR at the time we are ready to make the award, you will be disqualified. 
2.	Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to fund any white paper, pay any proposal preparation costs, or to award any contract. 
3.	All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper, which will be considered. No portion of this announcement is set aside for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's) or minority institutions (MI's); proposals are invited from all sources. The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The 412 TSS/DRP (ACQ) Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, CA is currently seeking information for replacing 5 existing flight vision analog video systems which have exceeded lifecycle requirements to accommodate an industry standard network of new technologies that provide the 412 Range customers flexibility, network connectivity, data transmission, storage, reduced bandwidth requirements, signal diversity, aggregate throughput, scalability and reduced operations and maintenance costs.  The upgraded system is required to ensure that all mission video and images are routed to the appropriate test participants to conduct test and evaluation operations.  We are also looking  for a system that will be maintainable for 5-7 years.  This upgrade will provide remotely controlled video equipment with high resolution/high definition TV (HDTV), high speed, infrared video and time, space, and positioning information interface capabilities to ground-based optical trackers required for flight testing.  The main components  of the system consist of Kineto Tracking Mount (KTM), imaging sensors, and operator cabin and distribution.  Other components consist of lenses, cameras, onsite solid state recording, auto track and remote control station capability.  This posting is neither a sources sought synopsis nor is it a solicitation.  This request for information is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government.  Interested entities are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, technical and contractual points of contact, phone numbers, and product information that supports the stated requirements.

<DESC>In accordance with the Revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has conducted a Streamlined Competition of Research-Evaluation Group, Office of Research, Development and Information (ORDI).  This study was announced on 5 March 2008.  In accordance with Public Law 109-115 (119 STAT. 2506, Section 842), CMS developed the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) utilizing the Streamlined Methodology.  CMS waived the 45-day extension option when developing the MEO.  The outcome of this Streamlined Study was determined, in part, by using documented market research. CMS has completed this study effective May 30, 2008. The results of this study confirm that it is more cost effective to retain the studied commercial activity in-house. This service is currently provided by thirty eight (38) Federal Government employees.  This streamlined competitive sourcing study was conducted at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2, to extend Contract No. 68-W-98-210 with CDM Federal Programs Corporation (CDM), and Contract 68-W-98-214 with Tetra Tech EC, Inc. (Tetra Tech), for up to six months.  The extensions to these contracts are critical to ensure continuity of critical services for on-going existing projects.  No new tasks will be issued under these contracts during this extension period.  EPA is currently reviewing and plans to award new competitive contracts.  CDM and Tetra Tech are the only sources to perform work on these twenty-seven (27) and thirteen (13) specific existing tasks, respectively, because of the highly specialized services that are performed under these contracts; their technical familiarity, detailed processing, and understanding of the current work plans; the need for the seasonal scheduling of the work; to meet oversight mandated consent decrees to avoid substantial damage in enforcement actions and litigation with potentially responsible parties; unavailable cross-over capacity from other existing contracts; and to avoid a substantial duplication of cost.  

This extension will ensure the specific projects are uninterrupted and can be completed on schedule to meet EPA’s commitments for site remediation.  As many of the construction efforts are at critical stages and this is the best time of year for this work to be performed, it is in the best interest of the Government to extend the existing contracts pending award of the follow-on competitive contracts which are currently under evaluation.  The proposed contract modifications will be issued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for other than full and open competition.

The contracts with CDM and Tetra Tech are for continuation of existing engineering, technical and management services in support of Region 2’s remedial response and enforcement oversight at sites of release or threatened release of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA).  These services cover sites in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  

The planned contract actions represent a “new work” extension of each contract for up to six months, effective July 6, 2008.  These modifications are necessary in order to ensure continuity of critical services for ongoing existing projects under these contracts, pending the award of contracts resulting from Solicitations PR-HQ-07-10525 and PR-HQ-07-11352.  Award of the contracts resulting from these solicitations has been delayed, which has necessitated that the above existing contracts be extended until these awards can be made, in order to provide for continuation of essential work on existing projects without interruption.  Region 2’s requirements to be covered by these extensions include ongoing remedial investigations and feasibility studies, remedial designs, implementation of remedial actions, and oversight of responsible party and potentially responsible party remediation projects to address and mitigate threats to human health and the environment caused by hazardous substance contamination in the Region 2 area.  No new tasks will be issued under these contracts during this extension period.  The work to be extended represents twenty-seven (27) existing projects under Contract 68-W-98-210 and thirteen (13) existing projects under Contract 68-W-98-214.

STATEMENT OF WORK

History of Biology and the NSF Circa 1975 to 2004

1. BACKGROUND

The National Science Foundation is among the leading scientific organizations in the post-World War II United States, and the history of the NSF and the histories of specific science and engineering disciplines in this country are intertwined.  In 2000, The Johns Hopkins University Press published Toby A. Appel’s Shaping Biology: The National Science Foundation and American Biological Research, 1945-1975.  The NSF is seeking a successor volume.

2. SCOPE 

The contractor shall provide non-personal services for the preparation of a scholarly monograph on the History of Biology and the NSF 1975 to 2004. The monograph must be completed in manuscript form, accepted by the NSF Historian and the Assistant Director for Biology (AD/BIO), and ready for negotiation with a publisher within 36 months after date of award.  

The monograph shall provide an accurate, complete, interpretive, and readable history, which shall be accessible to non-specialist readers. It should communicate the contributions of the NSF to American and world science, illuminate the process by which those contributions came to be, and provide a contextual account of past policy successes and failures. 

The final version of the manuscript must be publishable. This means that the quality shall be good enough to pass a rigorous historical and technical peer review process.

The contractor shall carry out the work under the direction of the NSF Historian who is responsible for the overall history of the agency.  

3. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT MATTER

This project is an intellectual and institutional history, documenting and evaluating the impact of NSF funding on the development of the biological sciences since 1975. The time period for the study is from the end point of Toby A. Appel’s Shaping Biology: The National Science Foundation and American Biological Research, 1945-1975, to February 2004.

The study should focus on at least three major issues:

(1)	In 1975, the Division of Biological and Medical Sciences was disbanded, and a new Directorate of Biological, Behavioral, and Social Sciences was established. The claim made by the NSF administration was that bringing together these diverse fields under one umbrella would lead to the interaction, branching, and convergence of disciplines to produce new, hybrid disciplines. Did this actually occur? What was the impact on biology of the later removal of the social and behavioral sciences from the directorate?
(2)	In the 1975 reorganization, biomedical research was removed from the NSF. How did this action impact the support of biological research at the NSF and the growth of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health?
(3)	How did the NSF respond to, assist and promote the changing nature of biology during these years? When the NSF chose to intervene in the field, how successful was it?

In analyzing these issues, as well as other issues the contractor deems important for gaining an understanding of the history of biology and the NSF, the contractor should consider the larger contexts of biological research being supported and conducted under auspices other than the NSF, federal support for science more generally, and the administrative history of the NSF.

4. PROCEDURES FOR HISTORICAL RESEARCH

The contractor shall be familiar with the general history of science and use this background knowledge to construct and present an innovative, intellectually challenging argument that is accessible to scholars, policymakers, and the general public.

The contractor shall perform primary archival research, read appropriate published reports, and interview key participants. The contractor shall be responsible for identifying appropriate illustrations and photographs for this book and obtaining permission. Illustrations and photographs shall be used only as appropriate to explain issues raised in the written work.

Primary documentation for this study is located at the NSF in Arlington, Virginia, National Archives II in College Park, Maryland, and the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland. Other documentation may exist in the papers of former NSF staff members and NSF grant recipients.

NSF will make available to the contractor for use in the project all agency records relevant to the work.

Appropriate professional oral history interviews with current and former NSF staff members, as well as recipients of NSF grants, should be conducted and the results incorporated into the monograph.

6. REQUIREMENTS 

The contractor shall provide a manuscript narrative of approximately 500 double-space pages. The manuscript shall conform to the Chicago Manual of Style on matters of format, style, and grammar. The manuscript shall include a table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, and graphics, illustrations, and photographs. After page proofs have been received from a publisher, the contractor shall correct page proofs and prepare an index. 

Reports of research progress, drafts, and all other material shall be delivered in accordance with the milestone schedule listed below. The NSF Historian and the AD/BIO will review the drafts and final manuscript for factual accuracy and interpretations of evidence. Outside peer review will be solicited in cases of disagreements between the NSF and the contractor, with the editing of any substantive matter in the manuscript to be negotiated between the contractor and the NSF Historian. The NSF Historian and the AD/BIO, however, shall have the right of final approval. After the manuscript has been completed by the contractor and approved by the NSF Historian and AD/BIO, the contractor shall provide advice to the NSF Historian on negotiating a contract with an academic or scholarly press for the publication of the manuscript.

All photocopied documents, interview transcriptions, photographs selected for inclusion, and rights to publication of the study become the property of NSF at the end of the project. 

Deliverables
The contractor shall submit written progress reports of 2-3 pages to the NSF Historian in accordance with delivery schedule shown below.

The contractor shall carry out the project using contractor office space, equipment, and supplies.  NSF will provide the contractor work space to conduct research in the files of the agency. The contractor shall make arrangements for space at other document repositories where appropriate records need to be researched.

The contractor must secure the prior approval of the NSF for: (1) any changes in the scope of the work, including the time frame for completion of each project milestone and the standards for publication for the monograph; (2) selection of any research assistants used by the contactor; (3) any negotiations with a university press for publication of the monograph.

7. WORD PROCESSING AND ELECTRONIC IMAGE CRITERIA

All drafts and the final manuscript shall be submitted as email attachments or on flash drives processed with a version of Microsoft Word. Font for the processed manuscript shall be 12-pitch Times New Roman or an equivalent approved before work commences.

Three paper copies on standard 8 ½ by 11 inch paper must accompany the electronic submission. The electronic submission and the paper copies must be identical.

Images for the manuscript shall be delivered in full-size glossy prints or in high-resolution (300 dpi) graphic files in jpeg or similar format.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-08-039-REL. This solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 541219 and the small business size standard is $7.5 million. PRICE SCHEDULE: Offers should be submitted for BASE YEAR: 400 hours @ $____________ per hour = $______________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 400 hours @ $____________ per hour = $______________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 400 hours @ $____________ per hour = $______________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 400 hours @ $____________ per hour = $______________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 400 hours @ $____________ per hour = $______________. INTRODUCTION: A new Federal program was created in 1996 to bring into parity the costs of urban and rural data communications circuits. This program was designed to reimburse rural health care facilities for the monthly costs incurred in providing data communications from the rural site to another connecting site. The formula for reimbursement was the closest urban city costs subtracted from the rural community costs which amounted to reimbursement to the rural facility. This new program was to be managed by the Rural Health Care Corporation (RHCC), a quasi-Federal agency that required a system of documents to be submitted in a chronological order. The information contained in these forms was of both a technical and demographical nature, requiring interaction between the communications carrier and the health care provider. Soon, the Billings Area Indian Health Service, Office of Information Management, discovered the need for a telecommunications specialist with prior experience with the system and the contracts within the system. Thus, the Indian Health Service has acquired these services previously through purchase orders. The Rural Health Care Division (RHCD), formerly known as the Rural Health Care Corporation (RHCC) was established to administer the Universal Service program for rural health care providers. RHCD is officially referred to as the Rural Health Care Division of USAC. STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor will be required to: (1) Aid in preparing the initial 465 Form, Description of Services Request, for submission to the RHCD; (2) Upon acceptance of the RHCD, prepare Form 466, Funding Request and Certification; (3) Maintain an orderly, organized folder of all correspondence from and to the RHCD. This requires monthly on-site interaction with the Indian Health Service Telecommunications Specialist at the Billings Area Office; (4) Verbally, and in writing, communicate with the carriers and the RHCD to ensure a timely and efficient flow of documentation; (5) Maintain a log of monies due and collectable by the Billings Area for reimbursement; and (6) Periodically review network for efficiencies with the T1 and 56K circuits. The contractor will be required to (1) inform the Indian Health Service of potential cost savings or price increases; (2) provide recommendations regarding telecommunications circuits; and (3) complete RHCD forms prior to deadlines. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, with four 12 month options. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit its invoice to the Project Officer. The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractors name, address; (2) Contract Number; (3) Invoice number and date; (4) Total amount due; (5) Dates of Service including the actual number of hours worked; and (6) Remit to address. Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

                                                       Amendment 3

The purpose of Amendment 3 is to address contractor questions as follows and to post the attendance list for the May 29, 2008 site visit.  No further questions will be accepted under this procurement.  Proposals are due June 6, 2006, 2 pm, EST.  See above instructions for its submittal.  

Questions posed from Potential Offerors

1.  Question:  (a) Can you tell me whether the above solicitation has an industry size standard ceiling for employees or revenue?  (b) Also, can you tell me if this small business set aside has any work allocation requirements similar to HubZone, SDVOB or 8(a) set aside programs?  Answer:  (a) The industry ceiling size is $13 million determined by the prime NAICS code of 238990.  (b)  This is a total local set aside reserved for small businesses residing or operating within the state of Oklahoma.

2.  Question:  You have listed both firm fixed pricing and cost plus in the statement of work can you please identify which the contract will fall under because FAR part 12 does not allow for both on a contract. It should be one or the other.  Answer:  This solicitation is requesting firm fixed pricing for all items, however, major repair and miscellaneous items will be negotiated should these items be required.  This is allowed under FAR 12.207(B).  Therefore, these items will continue to be identified as cost plus.  

3.  Question:  (a)  Which NAICS code will be the primary because under current regulations the vendor must carry all if a primary code is not identified and with the ranges from 13 to 32.5 million how will the determination be made for small business. (b)  In addition with a construction code verses a facilities maintenance will the 15% rule for the Prime apply under construction rules? Answer:  (a)  The prime or dominant NAICS code is 238990 which has a size standard of $13 million.  (b)  This requirement centers around the maintenance of mobile home trailers however there could be the possibility of some construction in this contract (i.e., building of stairs, etc.).

4. Question:  Must the prime submit a sub-contracting plan?  Answer:  It is up to the offeror to decide what to submit in their proposal, however, due to this procurement set aside for small business, it is not required.

5. Question:  Will the prime need to submit a detailed outline of work they will perform and which portion will be sub-contracted?  Answer:  It is up to the offeror to decide what to submit in their proposal.

6. Question:  Is it necessary to name all the sub-contractors?  Answer:  It is up to the offeror to decide what to submit in their proposal.

7. Question:  Will a bond be required? If so for how much since this is listed as construction?  Answer:  No bond will be required.

8. Question:  Since this is for small business will the Government reimburse 1-3% of the bond cost?  Answer:  Not applicable.

9. Question:  Activation is listed as part of the Statement of Work can you explain if that is for new units or relocation of current units?  Answer:  The Government reserves the right to increase new units as needs arise.  The majority of the work however will be the deactivation of these units which in essence is the relocation of the current units.  

10. Question:  Is there not a Memorandum of Understanding between DHS and DOI for the Buy Indian Act for the 10% rule? If so does FEMA honor that MOU?  Answer:  This issue is not relevant to the current procurement.

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a firm fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. No other solicitation will be issued. The North American Industry Classification Code is 561492. It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. 

STATEMENT OF WORK: 

Verbatim Transcription and Official Summary Working Minutes Services.
	
Nineteen meetings are projected in the base year, however, the Government reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of meetings per year. Meetings will average fifty participants whose comments will need to be captured verbatim with each speaker identified.
Meetings are highly scientific and technical in nature, they usually last one day, but at times last 2 days, from 8am to 6pm. Court reporters are required to stay until the meeting ends. 
Also, because of the wide variety of both the subject matter focus of each advisory committees and also the fact that each Committee Executive Secretary is a different person, an extensive amount of time must be allocated by the bidder to become familiar with both the content of each scientific area as well as the special needs and preferences for each committee with regard to how the summary minutes are presented. This requirement for interactive involvement between the court reporter/writer and the Committee Executive Secretary is continuous and ongoing not only because from time to time the person holding the position of Committee Executive Secretary may change which implies a change in the "working" summary preference requirements, but also because the content of the material discussed changes due to new discoveries in scientific research.
Transcribers must arrive one hour prior to the start of the meeting.
Deliverables: 
              1.Transcripts:
a. Hard Copies; 
b. 1 original + 1 copy;

 d.  1 word formatted – full transcript on 1 cd rom; 
1 pdf format with only 100 pages on each cd rom – please label cds accordingly (i.e., 1 of 3 Circulatory Meeting 9/19/07)
 e. Closed Session:
                        2 Hard Copies (no CDs) 
                    2. 1 audio of open and closed session – labeled accordingly with the word “audio”
        3. Summary Minutes:
       Summary Minutes of the entire meeting, one document for each day, not to exceed 25 pages per day. Include CD Rom in WORD format.

 

Delivery:

Final product must be received within five (5) business days. The transcripts must be delivered to: Project Officer
Telephone Numbers: 
TBD

Prior Notice requirements: 

In general, advisory committee staff endeavors to give all possible practical prior notice of one-day and two-day meetings which may be as much be 1 or 2 or 3 weeks previous to schedule dates, however because of circumstances beyond the control of staff such as weather or other mitigating conditions, bidder must be willing to accept as little as 1 or 2 days prior notice and be ready with all trained and skilled personnel to perform all services required and to be present for entire duration of proceedings. 

Contractor must be approved by FDA for access to privileged information and must be certified as being capable to receive and protect such information according to the requirements set forth in 21 CFR 20.90 (Disclosure to Contractor).

<DESC>1.  During the question period that closed on May 30, 2008 one question was submitted. The question received was:
 
Q:  In your objectives you state there are 177 centers and it is required that the vendors selected be able to cover all of the centers on a nationwide basis.  Then later it in the same paragraph it says the number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the vendors.
 
I am not sure what you are saying.  Are you saying that the vendor must be able to service all 177 locations or do you mean that you will be dividing the 177 locations into a number of regions?
 
If you are saying a vendor can bid a region, can you provide a list of regions with the centers in that region?

Answer:  While we have 177 centers nationwide that need coverage, it is not our expectation that any single firm will be able to provide coverage for all of these sites.  We will not be breaking the 177 locations in to regions or any other division/designation.  Our statement that the number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the vendors reflects the fact that we expect that there will need to be more than one award to service all 177 locations, but until we receive proposals, we have no way to determine how many contracts will be required to provide coverage to all locations.  Offerors are encouraged to propose coverage for whatever sites they are able to service.

2.  The date for receipt of proposals has not been extended as a result of this amendment.  All terms and conditions remain the same as stated in the original solicitation.

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI, in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is soliciting white papers for a new research program with the title, the Software Systems Stockroom (S3).

The increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems is reflected in a corresponding increase in the difficulty in developing software for these systems.  These difficulties are compounded by the dramatic increases in scale and scope of information processing applications due to the availability of networked heterogeneous distributed systems.  All of these effects have exacerbated the challenges that engineers face in trying to specify, design, build, verify and test software.  A number of codified approaches are available that utilize a technological framework for defining systems, expressing requirements, classifying components (meant throughout this announcement in the generic sense of constituent parts, which includes, but is not limited to, deployable components, classes, objects, modules, actors, and agents), validating systems and their components, and disseminating the results.  However, these approaches have demonstrated point solutions with a limited ability to mitigate risks with limited success.

Complexity and diversity in computational systems is an issue in information technology in general, but the unique combination of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability, and real-time operation requirements that military systems must satisfy set them sharply apart from non-military applications.  To successfully mitigate risks, approaches require community involvement, and a social framework for participation, discussion and a means for gaining community approval of new technologies.  Solutions to the increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems require a sustained commitment by the community to devise technologies that can be used for system design and the development of general use tools.  A software library is such a tool that is used to help develop applications by providing services and offering modularity, portability and efficiency of the code.  Libraries follow the principles of encapsulation and separation of concerns allowing programmers to add functionality.  Such tools strive to reduce complexity by providing a shared common resource, with a shared vocabulary, a shared understanding, and a shared culture of its use.   Furthermore, libraries can become an authoritative and trusted reference for software system development with the right framework and smart dedicated community effort. 

Objective:

This BAA seeks to improve the capability to produce software for DoD systems by encouraging the capture and reuse of domain knowledge and expertise through an open, community-driven, technically focused shared infrastructure.  A proposed infrastructure must build on sound principles of computer science, best practices of software engineering, and robust capture mechanisms (e.g. abstractions, libraries, architectures, patterns, etc.).  

White papers are being solicited for demonstrating and filling capture mechanisms of the infrastructure with knowledge and expertise applicable to one or more domains of interest to DoD.  Proposed efforts should align with a set of software and systems developers motivated to employ those mechanisms and show clear reduction in software and systems development costs for DoD warfighting systems.  These capture mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, ontologies and metadata, digital libraries, and software/system tools.  Of interest are approaches that focus on specific domains, but have the potential for expansion to other domains, support collaboration, encourage community-development, build upon open frameworks, and have a clear path to industrial acceptance.

Initial investments will be through small, focused technical implementations with a  targeted user base of software and systems developers working on software and systems deployed by the DoD for the warfighter.  To achieve the objectives, the proposed activities will likely require a team, consortium, or active community of interest to enable dissemination and use of the research products.  Offerors should clearly identify the specific technical niche (e.g., signal processing, vehicle management systems, weapons control mode executives, avionics), specific infrastructure technologies employed (e.g., reuse libraries, abstraction tools, design pattern capture), how the implementations, once matured, will be employed by systems developers, and motivating forces (economic, technical, competitive) that drive the community of systems developers to benefit from and support the investment proposed.  Extension of the technologies and techniques employed to other DoD interest areas and communities should also be addressed.

The intent of this solicitation is not generic reuse frameworks, or technologies solely addressing networking or communications challenges.


Research Concentration Areas:

Should include but not be limited to:

Community and Technical Specialization.  The S3 should focus on a technical area for which there is an active research and applications community, supportive of systematic standardization and codification of tools, techniques and practices at the component level.  A plan to engage and involve a wider community including industry, government, and academia must be provided. 

Classifications and Taxonomies.   Innovative approaches are sought for describing software systems components, their interrelationships, functional and non-functional dependencies, the construction environment, and that address complexity, derivations, invariants, signatures, provenance, traceability, provability, and attestations.  The taxonomies devised should facilitate understanding and classifying behaviors and properties that arise from combining components.  Of particular interest are systematic correct-by-construction derivations of components for classification and taxonomic structure.

Information Provenance and Intellectual Property.  The open framework should support laws and policies governing the use of digital intellectual property of data, software, systems and their derivations as transparently as possible for all stakeholders.

Architecture.  The architectural definition should provide the ability to understand and control those elements of the design that capture the utility, cost and risks.  The definition shall provide a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions, and interfaces.  In addition, an extended architecture should provide a structured framework for such items as accounts of success and failures, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results from assessments of usage, and forensic studies of software disasters that help define problems and basic research areas.

User Interface and Usability.  The style of interfaces that S3 presents to its users affects overall usability.  Scenarios that illustrate the salient features and their use should be provided in a storyboard style.

Technology Diffusion and the Developer Community.  A plan to involve the community of developers must be provided.  The plan should promote principles of interoperability, transparency, and accountability, encourage the use of the open framework and its resources, and engage vendors.

Collaboration.  Teaming, joint projects, and in-kind cooperation are encouraged especially when competing commercial interests find common ground to address DoD and community-wide needs.

Content and Experimental Prototype.  An S3 prototype with content provided by the research community of concern must be constructed as part of an empirical assessment of the feasibility and viability of the proposed S3 system.

Metrics.  The major characteristics of the S3 and its usage are to be assessed and, where possible, measured among others for accuracy, consistency, completeness, organization, transparency, trustedness, and usability.

International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export control issues.  These laws are to be enforced in the S3 at all times when sensitive material is involved.

Under another Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI) effort, the Systems and Software Producibility Collaboration and Evaluation Environment (SPRUCE) seeks to provide an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and run-time technologies to yield more predictable production of software intensive systems.  SPRUCE is a resource available for leverage if needed.

Program Phases:

This program will use a competitive prototyping model.  Under this strategy, funding will be provided for two or more competing teams for six months to produce a prototype and documentation.  The development and operation phase will follow the down select. 
The prototyping phase will consist of defining, developing, populating, and documenting the software development infrastructure and its context of employment. This phase will develop, populate, and document the prototype.  The documents should describe among other things the characteristics of the proposed infrastructure from the users' viewpoint.  It should also include defining, developing and documenting community of interest, tools, fundamental principles for organizing knowledge, any supporting architectures, as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing the design and evolution of the Stockroom.  The resulting documentation should be written to communicate the overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to the user, developer, stakeholders and other organizational elements.  It should describe the problem, targeted community, commercial partners, an open system framework, operational policies, interactions, and organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view.    
These initial concepts will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry, and Academia; therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with this requirement.   After the down select will be the development and operation phase.  

Anticipated Schedule for Phase 1 Activities:

The prototyping phase will begin with a kickoff workshop and proceed with a several month infrastructure definition and development of the S3 prototype.  A review workshop will be held mid-way through the first phase during which the initial concepts will be briefed to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia who have been invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.  The final months should be devoted to completing the initial concepts, the prototype, and incorporating comments from the review workshop.   A final review workshop will be held in the last month, at which time the final concepts, documentation, and prototypes will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.

Awardees will be required to present the full extent of their work at both a mid-term and a final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.

Attn: Mr. Steven Drager

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and carefully developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence, creativity, and innovation of the development and the usability of the proposed technology, which include the architecture, the knowledge and expertise it captures, interoperability, and methodology to broaden participation of the technical community. 
(2)	Collaboration and Information Sharing. The offeror must demonstrate a high level of commitment with detailed plans for collaboration among all major relevant parties.  That is, the offeror must provide plans for sharing results with the broader community and encouraging participating of team and non-team members alike in evaluations and information dissemination.
(3)	Related Experience.  The white paper will be judged on the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technical knowledge and competency in relevant domains of software technologies, balance of the skills set of the team, excellence of the academic-industry team members, experience with government contracts, and proven capability to conduct innovative practical research.  Of particular importance is acumen in the unique challenges of integration and development, anticipated in the near to far term.
(4)	Openness and Maturity of Solution. - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and previous demonstration of capability to accomplish the proposed tasks.
(5)	Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers or proposals.  Individual white papers and proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

Awardee will have to present the full extent of its work at a workshops, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.  Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.

3. REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

<DESC><p>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is a net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system (WS), capable of tasking ISR sensors and receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data/information from airborne, national, and commercial reconnaissance platforms and sensors such as the U-2, Global Hawk, and Predator. AF DCGS performs global multi-INT operations and correlates collected Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). This WS consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission-partner sites interconnected by the Global Information Grid (GIG). AF DCGS Increment 2 is the next major acquisition activity building upon the architectural framework established by AF DCGS Block 10.2. Increment 2 will modernize Signals Intelligence capabilities, integrating it into AF DCGS net-centric environment as well as provide new and enhanced capabilities and continuing IMINT and MASINT updates. AF DCGS WS capabilities will be expanded to handle an increased number of existing, upgraded, and new sensors with improved communications and processing/ exploitation timelines. Current planning is for these capabilities to be developed and fielded through several versions, with each version providing a capability that is affordable, militarily useful, and based on a mature technology. Delivery of Increment capabilities will be primarily based on user priorities and the availability of mature technologies. Please check back on HERBB for future updates and more information when it becomes available. Additionally, please hold all questions until such updates have been posted.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)The 827 ACSG Contracting Office Tinker AFB, OK is requesting information on replacement systems for 337 KC135R/T aircraft. PURPOSE The purpose of this RFI is to create a dialogue with industry. With this notice, the 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the Block 45 program. Your comments will help refine procurement strategy. Block 45 is considering a performance-based procurement with a single contractor solely responsible for all aspects of the modification. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. DESCRIPTION Block 45 is Increment 1 to KC-135 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Develop and field required capabilities to extend KC-135 as viable weapon system through 2040. The Block 45 modification consists of four modifications that will enable mitigation of capability gaps anticipated due to expected airspace restrictions of Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATM), resolve mission suitability shortfalls, shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability. Block 45 includes (1) Digital Flight Director (DFD) includes replacing Angle of Attack (AOA); (2) Radar Altimeter (RA); (3) Autopilot (AP). Services to include research and development, technology insertion, system integration, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support at Edwards AFB, studies/analyses, logistic support services, training and engineering support services, including re-engineering and reverse engineering, for a range of equipment. Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrades and operational support costs. Modification Installation effort: At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities. A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities. Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government. The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes. Businesses with the capability of providing the required services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates their ability to fulfill this requirement, information concerning performance-based contract measurement recommendations, contract type, and any other relevant recommendations. RESPONSE: The information you provide may be used by the USAF to ascertain and develop technical and programmatic acquisition approaches and/or strategies. Data obtained from this request will be considered and may be used for advanced planning, program phasing, and to define tailored technical requirements. As such, your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any fashion. Although the identification of the contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information received as a result of this RFI as part of a future acquisition strategy.

<DESC><p>Satellite Control and Network Systems Group (SCNG) intends to issue a contract action for the procurement of eleven (11) follow-on telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) core electronics and antennas, plus one (1) additional transportable RBC antenna for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC). The proposed action will be awarded as a new Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC), and will be a Fixed-Price Incentive contract for satellite and network control services and support. The original ordering period on the SCNC contract has expired due to Government funding constraints and the complexity of RBC development.</p>
<p>This effort involves the procurement and fielding of the core electronics and antenna facilities for 11 AFSCN ground stations with possible options to enhance the network's capability by fielding more ground stations world wide. The AFSCN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides TT&amp;C, mission data dissemination, and processing. It is also one of the nation's primary high-powered networks for emergency anomaly resolution of space vehicles.</p>
<p>The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is undergoing a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations (RBC upgrade). There are five (5) RBC antennas, one (1) transportable RBC antenna, one (1) RBC Integration and Support Suite (RISS), and one (1) Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF) RBC project currently on contract. This next contract will continue the modernization effort for the rest of the AFSCN by replacing the remaining legacy ARTS core electronics and antenna systems with RBC systems and adding new, additional remote tracking stations to the network.

<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether potential offerors exist that are capable of achieving program objectives within acceptable cost, performance, and schedule parameters. Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001 and is presently on contract for development of the first five (5) RBC articles. Due to requirements and schedule changes, the ordering period for the remaining eleven (11) RBC articles has expired. The nature of this acquisition is unique due to the complexity of integrating both legacy and systems currently in development. HTSI has performed identical work on the previous RBC articles. All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered. The Government anticipates that there may be a small percentage of set-asides for this action. Responses from small and small disadvantaged<br />businesses are encouraged. The current expected contract order award date is the first or second quarter of fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p>Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC with documented evidence of their capability to meet all cost, performance, and schedule requirements electronically no later than 02 Jul 2008 to the Points of Contact (POC) listed below.</p>

<p>1. RBC Requirements Document (RD)<br />2. Transportable RBC Unique &amp; Common Requirements<br />3. Waivers/Requirements Clarifications<br />4. AFSCN CONOPS</p>
<p>The SOC package should provide a summary of capabilities and past experience with the following information:</p>
<p>1. Cover Letter: Provide company name, mailing address, contracting and technical POCs, CAGE code, and statement of business size classification. Small business offerors please note that NAICS 541710 (1,000 employees) applies. The cover letter must be signed and dated by an authorized officer of the organization. <br />2. Executive Summary: Describe the proposed program, objectives, and approach. <br />3. Program Plan: Describe in detail the planned technical approach and how the approach will be executed. Provide a detailed description of the proposed system will seamlessly integrate with the existing RBC articles, without extensive redesign of or testing with the RBC system, will be accomplished, performed, and implemented. Include a concept of products, techniques, methods, materials, and a milestone chart identifying capability to meet requirements. Include a summary of cost, schedule and technical risks associated with the SOC program plan.<br />4. Past Performance: Outline relevant and recent experience in AFSCN RBC, or equivalent command and control (C2) project, development and integration. Include a list of points of contact (POC) with phone numbers and email addresses. <br />5. Personnel and Facilities: Describe ability to provide qualified personnel and facilities to work at the appropriate security level. <br />6. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost Estimate: Explain cost savings expected due to realization of learning curve.</p>
<p>All responses must be signed, scanned, and submitted by email to the POCs listed below in MS Word or PDF format, conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with no smaller than 12 point font. All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed fifty (50) one-sided pages. The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.</p>
<p>All submitted SOCs will be evaluated to establish a pool of sources capable of supporting this requirement; small businesses that submit a SOC should indicate if they are interested as either potential prime contractor or subcontractor. The Government will then determine extent of competition based on, but not limited to, availability of responsible qualified sources and integration capabilities. This determination is solely within the discretion of the Government. The selection of one or more sources for determination of competition will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's SOC to determine the overall merit of capability. The SOCs will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Minimal duplication costs for RBC development.<br />2. Ability to maintain schedule requirements and meet delivery date for at least one (1) RBC site per year starting in FY11 and two (2) RBC sites per year starting in FY13. <br />3. Capability of meeting requirements and performance parameters as listed in the provided attachments.<br />4. Capability for seamless integration into the AFSCN RBC architecture.</p>
<p>DECLARATION: Submit questions to the e-mail addresses below. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>

<DESC>The first sentence in description is changed to read:  Technical Evaluation Assessment Monitor Site (TEAMS).  The rest of the description text remains unchanged.

Background:  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) operates the Technical Evaluation Assessment Monitor Site (TEAMS) which is located on Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), New Mexico and has been in operation for over six years.  TEAMS is a low-cost, premier, multi-use site where preliminary evaluation, assessment, demonstration, training, fielding, and integration are performed for developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf systems to detect, combat, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive threats for DTRA, DOD, and non-DOD agencies and their contractors. 

The TEAMS facility is located at KAFB. The site is 24 acres, completely fenced and secured with limited access and 24 hour monitoring.  The site has office spaces, conference rooms, and on-site storage available.  Both 50 Hz and 60 Hz electrical power is available for testing US and non-US systems and for testing systems destined for deployment OCONUS..  The site has water, sewer, paved roads, parking, and three US standard railroad sections (spurs).  Seaboard containers, 8, 20, and 40 foot are available on-site.  TEAMS stores and has immediately available radiological sources with access to medical sources from an off-site organization.  

TEAMS supports the 377th ABW Security Forces with several radiation monitoring detectors and support network at several KAFB access points.    Currently, TEAMS provides logistical support of the system and training for KAFB Security Forces personnel.

Description: The scope of the effort is to provide test support and facility operations to DTRA’s TEAMS facility for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) detectors and sensors.  This consists of handling low-level radiological sources and explosives, assessing and evaluating detector technologies and systems, evaluating the ability of the TEAMS facility to support customer requirements, and analyzing, interpreting, reporting, and storing test results.  Additionally, the scope calls for providing support for ensuring the availability of TEAMS’ infrastructure and the programs supported at TEAMS and for TEAMS to provide Research and Development (R&D) and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) testing of detectors and sensors for use by the Department of Homeland Security, Domestic Nuclear Detector Office, and Department of State.  Work will be performed primarily at Kirtland AFB and Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Contractors may be required to support testing at the Nevada Test Site, NV or at other locations worldwide.  The contractor may be required to support CBRNE operations 24 hours a day, 7 days a weeks.

Objective:  The objective of this effort is to obtain a team of qualified personnel for day-to-day maintenance of the TEAMS facility, the resident radiological sources, and all on-site equipment (i.e. hand-held and stationary nuclear detectors).  The contractor shall monitor the KAFB nuclear detectors and provide support to the ABW Security Forces, and provide a knowledgeable resource for test customers.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide a team to conduct R&D and IV&V testing on CBRNE detectors and support CBRNE operations.  

The technical requirements of this task are as follows:  

- Facility Infrastructure Availability

  - Provide access to site, site security, and presence.
  - Maintain inventory (radiological sources, etc.).
  - Monitor base nuclear detectors (normal duty times and 24/7 on-call).
  - Ensure availability and usability of all site assets.
  - Respond to data requests from test customers and government agencies.
  - Interface with Test Customers to schedule and plan testing, training, or provide support.

- Test Support (R&D and IV&V)
  - Level 1: Provide test engineers/scientists and technicians when required.
  - Level 2: Provide full test team – Test Director to technician as required.
  - Data collection, documentation, reporting, and archiving.

- Operational Support
  - Level 1: Provide support of on- and off-site CBRNE operations which may be 24/7 (i.e. Operational Command Post for movement of radiological materials).
  - Level 2: Provide Operational Team for on- and off-site CBRNE operations.

Respondents (contractors) are requested to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the technical requirements outlined above.  SOCs are limited to a total of five (5) single space pages. Submit responses electronically to rudy.chavez@abq.dtra.mil and david.lojewski@abq.dtra.mil by close of business on June 18, 2008. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  No technical or solicitation document exists now.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification may occur in the 2010 timeframe. 

This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers (more specifically defined below) may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors (as defined below) from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

This notice is intended for component manufacturers, such as weavers/knitters/spinners of fabric, fabric netting, fabric mesh, webbing, tapes, bindings, and/or sewing threads; and formers of textile, metal, plastic, and/or composite fasteners, closures, connectors, adjusters, and pulls. 

This announcement is NOT intended for vendors or manufacturers of pocketry, flotation, gear carriage vests, hydration, cooling/heating technologies, armor carriers, armor hard plate, fragmentation soft plate, harnesses, webgear, cushion covers, other man-mounted clothing, or any other prime vendors outsourcing to the aforementioned component manufacturers.  

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.  A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired.   

Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant.  Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. 

Intereseted component manufacturers (as described above) may be prepared to present product samples of soft and hard components that may enhance the capability of an integrated gear carriage /ballistic/fragmentation hoist/ fall arrest system currently in development. These soft and hard components have the potential to be incorporated into a Dept of Navy system detail specification. 

Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day.  No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day beginning May 27, 2008. Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. 

This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Potential requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing a potential solicitation are welcome. 

In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.marseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used. Industry Day will start at 830 a.m. and end no later than 4 p.m. on Thursday, the 19th of June 2008. The interested vendors will be requested to reconfirm the appointment by a given date, and provide the names and titles of the parties who will be attending.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Department of Homeland Security (DSH), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of non-sparking tool kits, to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by emergency responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or hazardous materials (HAZMAT) environments. The CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information on non-sparking tool kits. The DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 03OE-04-KTTL. The requested information will be included in the non-sparking tool kits market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP non-sparking tool kits assessment. By providing information in response to this RFI, you agree that the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responder (SAVER) Program may use both the equipment information and any provided images in SAVER outreach. The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer. The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The assessment will include specific scenarios which require the evaluators to use the equipment to complete tasks while wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. The criteria include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability. If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide, in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, web address, and e-mail address. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments while wearing PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research, and new developments. Finally, please include cost information such as initial costs, replacement parts, accessory options, and available warranties. Do not send your equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY POSTPONED. The project work consists of removing shoals from the Manatee Harbor Entrance Channel and Turning Basin, dredging to a required depth of 40 feet plus 1 foot allowable overdepth.  A drag bar may be used for Stations 94+00 to 171+29 in lieu of dredging.  There is approximately 6,000 cubic yards (cy) in this area.  From Stations 16+17 to 94+00 dredging is required.  The quantity to be dredged is approximately 210,200 cy.  The maximum dredge size that will be allowed on this project is a 24 inch discharge cutter-suction dredge.  Dredged material will be placed at the designated upland disposal area, located at the Manatee County Port Authority approximately 3 miles from the channel.  Minor earthwork will be required at the disposal site to include dressing of the dike.  Weirs located on the cross dike of the upland disposal area will be removed and disposed of.  Turbidity and ammonia monitoring will be required.  Special Note: Low water levels in Lake Okeechobee make it impractical to mobilize equipment through the Okeechobee Waterway.  The project is located on the west coast of Florida in Manatee County near the town of Terra Ceia, approximately 25 miles south of Tampa.

The HARS is being remediated with uncontaminated, Category I dredged material by placement of at least a 1-meter thick sediment cap.  A Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) developed for the HARS, encompasses, through tiered selection criteria, precision bathymetric surveying, side-scan sonar analysis, sub-bottom seismic profiling, surface and subsurface sediment collection and analysis (photography, benthic community structure analysis, grain size, chemical characteristics and toxicity, bio-assays and bio-accumulation studies), water quality analysis, oceanographic and sedimentological process studies.  The SMMP is being used as a guideline to manage placement of dredged material at the HARS, to ensure efficient construction of the 1-meter sediment cap, and to monitor changes at the HARS while remediation activities occur and, ultimately, to ensure remediation has been completed.  The USACE New York District (CENAN) is responsible for contracting and overseeing the various activities described in the SMMP.  A revised HARS SMMP is being prepared for adoption in 2008.  Alternative locations for ocean placement of dredged materials may be necessary after HARS remediation is completed and it may be necessary to investigate alternatives during the final years of HARS remediation.<BR>This future contract will be used to complete the activities described in the HARS SMMP and related activities in a timely, technically sound, and cost effective manner.  Additionally, this contract will allow data collection associated with investigation of future sites for ocean placement of dredged materials.
