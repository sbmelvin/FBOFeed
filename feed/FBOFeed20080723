<DESC>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) requires a contractor to provide Cafeteria and Event Support Services which shall include the contractor establishing and operating, in the contractor’s name, the cafeteria at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Headquarters, 441 G Street, N.W., Washington, DC for the purpose of dispensing food, nonalcoholic beverages and event support services, in accordance with all terms and conditions specified in the solicitation.   This procurement is open to all business concerns.  The cafeteria shall be operated for the benefit of approximately 3400 occupants of the GAO Building; this figure is an estimate only and not a guarantee of building occupancy.   The cafeteria portion of the contract is not funded as revenues will be generated through customer sales.  

In addition to the Cafeteria Services, the contractor shall provide Event Support Services which will support a variety of functions held by the GAO. The services range from small executive luncheons to large conferences where food service may include continental breakfast, coffee and snack breaks, luncheons (both sit down and buffet), and/or receptions.  While most of the events are held during the day, mostly 7:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m., a few receptions will be scheduled in the evening, weekends, and holidays which require support by the contractor. The period of performance for this contract shall be for a base period and four (4) one-year options with a projected contract start date on or about January 5, 2009.

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the government.   However, should the State Licensing Agency (SLA) submit an offer which is determined to be in the final competitive range, the SLA will be awarded the contract in accordance with the Randolph-Sheppard Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 107).  The solicitation shall be issued on or about August 11, 2008.   Interested firms should submit their requests for the solicitation to Deja E. Craddock via email to craddockd@gao.gov referencing Solicitation No. GAO-09-N-0005.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>Assessing the Evidence Base for Context-Sensitive Effectiveness and Safety of Patient Safety Practices: Developing Criteria 
<SOLNBR>AHRQ-2009-10001
<CONTACT>Linda Simpson, Phone 301-427-1705, Fax 301-427-1740, Email linda.simpson@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Contracts Management, is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition basis to assist AHRQ in developing criteria for assessing the evidence base for the context-sensitive effectiveness and safety of patient safety practices.  For the purpose of this requirement, Patient Safety Practices (PSPs) are defined as interventions, strategies, or approaches intended to prevent or mitigate unintended consequences of the delivery of health care and to improve the safety of health care for patients. PSPs may include clinical interventions; systems, organizational and behavioral interventions; and various combinations of these. The effectiveness of PSPs may be affected by the nature, number, and sequencing of components; where they are implemented; with whom, for what purposes; as well as by features of the external environment as noted above. For purposes of developing criteria for evidence review, it is important to note that the labels given to these PSPs often do not convey the full range of the PSP intervention or construct. Tasks include: 1. Form an interdisciplinary panel of experts in patient safety practice, frontline healthcare delivery, clinical and health services research, behavioral and social sciences, research and evaluation design and methodology, systems engineering, management science, and other disciplines as necessary. 2. Identify a diverse and representative set of PSPs to be used as initial subjects for helping to iteratively develop criteria for rigorous and systematic assessment of the context-sensitive effectiveness and safety of PSPs. 3. Identify research and evaluation models, methods, and designs that could be used to rigorously evaluate the PSPs identified as part of item 2 above. 4. Develop a set of criteria, including criteria for strength of evidence, to be used for assessing future studies and reports. 5. Identify specific needs for further development of theories, constructs, and research/evaluation designs and methods to further strengthen evaluations of PSPs and criteria for systematic review. 6. Provide a final summary report of the methods employed to develop the criteria, and recommendations for next steps. The successful qualified offeror must optimize their creativity and flexibility to achieve optimum results. Offerors must possess substantial experience with patient safety and health quality improvement concepts and practices. The offeror must be experienced with assessing study quality and standardizing criteria for evidence reviews and syntheses. Minimum qualifications include: • A minimum of 5 years’ experience assessing evidence in health care delivery research. • Staff experienced in assessing the roles of clinical factors, contextual factors and implementation processes in patient safety improvement implementation research and evaluation. • Project leadership with an advanced degree such as a Ph.D. in social sciences and knowledge of the health care delivery system and patient safety issues, or MD with experience in organizational, engineering, management science or similar fields and knowledge of the health care delivery system and patient safety issues. • Ability to attract a trans-disciplinary and diverse set of technical experts and maintain their involvement in the development of criteria for systematic evidence reviews in patient safety. • Ability to translate complex research and evaluation concepts into language accessible to potential implementers of patient safety improvement practices. • Corporate experience must include a minimum of 10 relevant projects over the past 10 years. Note: Offeror does not have to have prior experience working for AHRQ; rather, an offeror must show a significant presence working in the health care industry specifically dealing with patient safety implementation research/evaluation.

For information purposes the following is provided:  the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611 ($5 Million) and the period of performance will be one (1) year from date of award.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s site at http://ahrq,gov.  Once in AHRQ’s homepage go to “Funding Opportunities” then to “Contracts” and then to “Request for Proposal (RFP).”  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about August 14, 2008 with proposals due October 13, 2008.

<DESC><p>The 319th Contracting Squadron intends to issue a solicitation for snow and ice removal services at Grand Forks AFB, ND. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services, except as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) as Government-furnished property. Performance shall be to the standards in the contract as well as all local, state, and federal regulations. The solicitation will result in a firm fixed price requirements contract with a base year and four one-year option periods. The base period of performance will be from 1 Oct 08 through 30 Sep 09. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488490, and the small business size standard is $6.5M. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business set-aside. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 30 June 08 via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO). Paper copies of the solicitation will not be mailed. Prospective offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation; prospective offerors are encouraged to register for notification through FBO. All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) to be eligible for award. Registration requires a DUNS number and may take up to three weeks to process. Instructions are available at the CCR website.
<p>Additionally, the 319th Contracting Squadron requests informational responses in regards to specific industry standards and commercial practices within the snow/ice removal industry. The Government is exploring avenues to decrease costs without sacrificing service and/or capability. Included in this notice is a draft PWS for the service that the Grand Forks AFB intends to solicit offers for. The draft PWS is included for offerors to evaluate and potentially provide feedback on specific requirements which are viewed as excessive and unnecessary. Any suggestions on how to change or relax requirements/standards to better align with the commercial marketplace and industry standards are appreciated. Upon evaluation by the acquisition team, responses may be considered and used to refine PWS requirements/standards. In addition, the Government requests your response to the following:</p>
<p>1)What is the commercial threshold for responding to a snow event? GFAFB's draft PWS requires a response after &frac14;" of accumulation. If this were increased to &frac12;" or 1", in terms of percent of costs, what might the cost savings be?</p>
<p>2)Para 1.2 "Snow Hauling" of the draft PWS directs snow hauling within 24 hours after the snow event. What are typical timeframes or standards within the commercial market for this requirement? Does this requirement exist in the commercial marketplace?</p>
<p>3)What method of commercial contracting and/or pricing options is most prevalent? (Pricing options - per push, per event, per inch, or per season) Are there any other pricing options besides the ones listed?</p>
<p>4)Do snow removal providers simply base their per season prices on historical averages? If so, from what source is this data collected?</p>
<p>5)One requirement Grand Forks AFB is considering is pre-pricing out snow/ice removal per square foot of parking lot and per mile of road. This pre-priced item will then be used during contract management to price out modifications for adding or deleting roads/parking lots as necessary. Is this a viable option and/or compatible with current market practices?</p>
<p>Responses and recommendations received by 4:30 PM CST on Tuesday, 17 June 2008 will be evaluated prior to issuing the solicitation.</p>

An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.  Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.
(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.<BR><BR>(g)Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 238990, size standard of $13 million, and will be issued as a competitive 8(a) set-aside.

The estimated magnitude of this project, to include option years, is between $5 million and $10 million.

<DESC>Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The FAA intends to award a single source contract to JVN Communications, INC. to provide engineering products and services supporting the FAA Interfacility and Radar Simulator (FIRS) product previously developed by JVN and procured by the Government.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire these engineering support services on a single source basis for the following reasons:  The FIRS tool is a large, complex integrated system of hardware and software that has been developed over the past 18 years by JVN Communications, INC.  This system has been developed, maintained, and enhanced by JVN to meet the unique requirements of FAA research and development activities. This contract must continue without interruption, providing our customers including other organizations within and outside of the FAA, with needed services to continually research ways in which to improve the current Air Traffic Control (ATC) System.  The FIRS tool is used on many FAA systems.  JVN Communications, INC is the only source available to enhance, maintain, and make necessary changes to the FIRS family of products.   Engineering support for FIRS tools requires a thorough knowledge of the existing FIRS software baseline.   JVN Communications, INC is the only source available with the combination of skills listed above and the proven track record to satisfy the FAA's requirement to maintain and enhance the FIRS family of products in a timely and effective manner, and to meet the WJHTC's goal in the required time frame.
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above service, the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to William Bleda not later than 12 noon, Eastern Standard Time, August 01, 2008. Responses may be sent via e-mail to William.Bleda@faa.gov.

QUOTESAREBEING REQUESTED.  Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT000760 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National EnergyTechnology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, for delivery to our site inMorgantown, WV  intends to purchase the following:Black-Oil Simulator: The Black-oil simulator needs to use a three-componentmodel for reservoir situations in which oil reserves and oil recovery needtobe known but the effects of fluid phase composition on flow behavior do notneed to be considered. The simulator needs to be capable of being upgradedwithan enhanced coal bed methane simulator in the future. The simulator alsohas tohave the ability to be coupled with geomechanical and flow simulations.The Black-Oil simulator should be capable of Up to four components. Theblack-oil model should assume that the reservoir fluids consist of threecomponents (water, oil, and gas) in a three-phase system (liquid, gas, andgasin solution), with components miscible in all proportions. Four componentsshould also be considered for modeling reservoir recovery mechanisms wheninjected fluids are miscible with hydrocarbons in the reservoir.The simulator needs to be a fully implicit three-phase 3D simulation. Theblack-oil simulation software needs to be capable of modeling extensivewellcontrols and support efficient field operations planning, including waterandmiscible-solvent gas injection.The simulator must be compatible with the latest versions of PETREL so wecanmore easily collaborate with current university and industrial partners.Compositional Simulator: A compositional simulator needs to be capable ofstudying condensates or volatile crude oils, gas injection programs, andsecondary recovery studies.The Compositional simulator should be capable of modeling gas injection,miscible flooding, carbon dioxide flooding. It should also be able tohandlesituations where the injection gas is soluble in both oil and water thickreservoirs with a compositional gradient due to gravity reservoirs, withfluidcompositions near the bubblepoint, high-pressure high-temperaturereservoirs,and naturally-fractured reservoirs.The simulator must be compatible with the latest versions of PETREL so wecanmore easily collaborate with current university and industrial partners.Local Grid Refinement add-on software option: The local grid refinementoptionmust allow for enhanced grid definition near wells and faults.The gridrefinement option should allow three dimensional local models to be radial,unstructured, or Cartesian coordinates. When the local models are in twodimensions, the grid refinement should allow for radial or unstructuredcoordinates. Local models should be allowed to have more layers than theglobalmodel, with the transmissibilities between the local models and the globalmodel computed automatically.The grid-coarsening options should allow youtoreduce simulation cycle time and maintain precision by resampling cells inregions of the field where accuracy is not as critical while maintainingthenecessary precision where required.Coalbed Methane Add-on module: The coalbed methane add on should be able toaccount for multiple wellbore developments. It should be able to quantifythevalue of the zonal isolation between production areas. Is should be able toidentify the value of hydraulic treatments and horizontal wells within thecoalbed. The module should be able to examine complex dual porosity nature ofthecoalbed via a modified Warren and Root model.CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery and Storage simulator Module that is capable ofsimulating migration of CO2 within an oil field or brine-filled formation,taking into account the solubility of the CO2 within the brine, as well aswater within the CO2 (and the associated precipitation of salt from theevaporated brine).DELIVERY: FOB Destination is required (all freight included).

<CONTACT>Ron Loube, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 827-7031, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email Ronald.Loube@fda.hhs.gov - Terry Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7106, Email Terry.Frederick@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA intends to issue an RFP to provide non-clinical and clinical studies to assess the effects of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children, as well as overarching coordination and program management activities, in furtherance of the Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative.

FDA’s mission is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.  FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by fostering innovations that make medical products more safe, effective, and affordable.  As part of its goal of fostering innovation, FDA seeks to identify and address those scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  A key aspect of the Agency’s mission is to identify, and help address, potential safety concerns associated with all products under its jurisdiction and this includes the use of anesthetics and sedatives in pediatric patients.

Non-clinical studies in juvenile animal models have shown that exposure to some anesthetics and sedatives is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system, as well as memory and learning deficits.  Anesthetic agents that have been specifically implicated are NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, and GABA agonists, such as sevoflurane.  The anesthesia community and the FDA acknowledge that there are insufficient human data to either support or refute the clinical relevance of these findings for pediatric patients.  Therefore, additional non-clinical and clinical studies will be needed to assess the effect of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children.

The SAFEKIDS Initiative is a new requirement and will be a multi-phased, multi-year effort; however, the subject synopsis is expected to encompass only the initial phase of the overall initiative.  FDA anticipates soliciting proposals from entities capable of completing one or more of the following tasks/studies:

(1)  Assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric patients administered regional or general anesthesia as neonates or infants;

(2)  Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and short- and long-term neurotoxic effects of an anesthetic in infants undergoing various surgical procedures;

(3)  Assessment of the effects of anesthetic exposure on neurocognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes;

(4)  Assessment of long-term cognitive development following general anesthesia as an infant;

(5)  Evaluation of mechanisms of and potential prevention of neurotoxicity after administration of an inhalation anesthetic in an animal model; and

(6)  Development of an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support the creation and execution of a series of projects under the SAFEKIDS Initiative

The period of performance for each individual task order listed above is expected to be approximately 26 months from date of award.  Planning and performing studies to address the aforementioned issues will involve enormous challenges in terms of design, assurance of validity and reliability of the outcome measures, and ethical considerations.  Because it is unlikely that any one entity will possess all of the necessary expertise and resources to accomplish all work required under this requirement in a timely and efficient manner, it is expected that the services will be provided under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders.  There is no predetermined number of awardees:  More than one individual task order may be awarded to a single deserving entity.

FDA anticipates (1) soliciting the services as a “Full and Open” competitive requirement:  Not as a set-aside for any specific class of business concern and (2) utilizing the procurement methods proscribed in FAR Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation.  The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.


The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be:  541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).


This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 7, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page:  http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated proposal due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 6, 2008, and September 19, 2008, respectively.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to build an Adaptive Optics Fourier Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (AO-FDOCT) system.
The adaptive optics Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (AO-FDOCT) system shall be able to acquire high-speed, high-resolution, cross-sectional retinal images and full three-dimensional retinal maps from human, non-human primate, and large animal subjects (the system is not required to acquire images from small animals).  AO components are required to correct for static and dynamic aberrations to achieve near diffraction-limited illumination beam focus. Spectrometer-based FDOCT hardware shall achieve a theoretical axial resolution of <6 &#956;m in tissue. An auxiliary wide-field imager is necessary to obtain a global view of the retina for orientation and to facilitate AO-FDOCT scan positioning. All software and a detailed user manual shall be included. The system shall be installed at FDA and training shall be provided to FDA scientist(s) by the contractor. <p>

It is anticipated that one (1) firm fixed price contract will be awarded with a performance period of six (6) months from the date of award. FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a total small business set-aside requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 7, 2008 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before September 8, 2008.<p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for research demonstrating system level performance ofan actively cooled cryogenic thermal shield for long duration storage of liquid oxygenand liquid methane. The system to be tested requires integration of a flight-typecryocooler, cooled helium loop, and a cooled radiation shield installed on a cryogenictank within a high fidelity multi-layer insulation (MLI) blanket.NASA/GRC intends to procure this research task from Ball Aerospace corporation as anadditional task under an existing contract.The research services sought through this directed research contract are available atreasonable cost only from the BATC, as the majority of the unique research hardware andexpertise required has been or will be developed at BATC under BATC internal research anddevelopment (IRAD) funding. The BATC supplied hardware includes but is not limited to acryogenic test tank, high performance multi-layer insulation blanket, vacuum chamber,flight-type cryocooler, a cooled shield, helium flow loop, integration components, andinstrumentation and data acquisition systems. BATC will also integrate their hardwareinto a CBRS system and test its performance with BATC IRAD funding. As such, the BATCprovides unique expertise and capability to provide the particular research servicesproposed. NASA will provide to BATC a cryogenic helium cooled thermal shield ofalternative design (ultra-light weight), which will be integrated into the BATC systemand tested separately. Thus, this BATC collaborative test opportunity is unique in thatthe government will obtain integrated performance data on two versions of the CBRS systemto enhance the anchoring of the government thermal and fluid dynamic models. The research services are deemed to be available only from the BATC which is in this caseconsidered a follow-on effort to the previous contract awarded as the Delivery andStorage of Cryogenic Propellants for Exploration Missions in which the CBRS system wasanalyzed and shown to offer significant potential benefit to Exploration systemsrequiring long duration storage of cryogens.  Seeking other than a sole-sourceprocurement would cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is notexpected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling theagencys requirements and deliverables under the IPP program.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfyagency requirements.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon August 4, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC), intends to procure the services of Origem Consultoria Ceintifica, Rua Nagib Izar 314, 03337-070 Sao Paulo (SP) Brazil. Origem will work with FIC on analysis of diarrhea and influenza data obtained at the Multinational Influenza Seasonality of Mortality Study (MISMS) meetings from American and Asia countries particularly Thailand, Filipinas, Brazil and Mexico.  Implement user-friendly interfaces to inform end users about the causality of diarrhea disease. These services are set within the framework of an on-going Multinational Influenza Seasonality of Mortality Study (MISMS) study conducted by a team of epidemiologist from the FIC and National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Origem has been involved in the study of spatio-temporal patterns of influenza and diarrhea with the FIC previously, resulting in the publication and submission of peer-reviewed articles and conferences abstract.  Origem has been developing analytical tools for the Matlab platform that proved to be useful in several of the studies currently taking place and in fact to analyze data brought from different countries of the MISMS meetings. The period of performance will be for one full calendar year.   In addition to the above Origem will also provide the specific tasks listed:


SPECIFIC TASK:

   INFLUENZA  


Origem will continue to analyze the datasets obtained at the Multinational Influenza Seasonality of Mortality Study (MISMS) meetings from American and Asian countries, particularly Thailand, Filipinas, Brazil and Mexico.  Like in the Brazilian case these analyses will be based upon mortality data, virus surveillance date and vaccination coverage data as it relates to MISMS. The description of such patterns will be performed in the highest possible resolution allowed by the datasets, both spatially and temporally. The particularities of the influenza seasonal patterns in each geographic region will be described - both in their stationary parameters (as captured by spectral estimation, which is mathematically related to Fourier decomposition analysis, whereby the variability of the time-series is described as a distribution of uncorrelated components of cycles) and in their non-stationary aspects - as captured through the use of Wavelet analysis. 

The analyses of these time series within a geographic perspective shall also enable the investigation of transmission patterns as a function of demographic and spatial factors.  For instance, phase variables (reflecting the period of occurrence of cyclic events as captured by the Fourier decomposition in the stationary analysis and phase differences in wavelet analysis.  There are expected to provide important insights into the progress of an epidemic throughout a geographic and demographic landscape at the continental scale used in the present study. Origem will also investigate potential correlations between seasonal climate variations and mortality records based upon weekly Pneumonia and Influenza mortality reports. Such investigations will be conducted by clustering the similar eco-climatic regions of each country and then exploring the climatic conditions that better explain both temporally and in amplitude their epidemiological patterns. Monthly climatic climatologies for the whole period and for each region will be obtained from the database originated by the interpolation of data from meteorological stations.

SPECIFIC TASK:


   DIARRHEA DISEASES


Origem will continue the venue of exploring putative waves of diarrheic diseases in data-sets mainly in tropical regions.  The statistical techniques employed in past research allowed with the support of expertise knowledge and bibliographic research, to distinguish the predominant bacterial and parasitic temporal profile from the 
predominant viral (mainly rotavirus) profile.  Latin-American, African and Asian data-sets should be explored and compared to cross-validate the findings.

	These research studies will generate co-authored scientific literature to be published in peer reviewed journals.


	Origem Consultoria Cientifica is a scientific consultancy company founded by researchers graduated at Oxford University (United Kingdom), who have a broad experience in the fields of epidemiology, geo-spatial data-analyses, statistics and software design.  Origem SC has successfully conducted scientific research with Oxford University on the ecological aspects related to the evolution of certain viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, as well as created risk maps to predict the future spatial distribution of these viruses.  These skills were also used to study the seasonality of Campylobacter infections as determined by environmental driving forces, in project collaboration with Oxford and Cardiff (Wales) Universities.  Origem has been involved in the study of spatio-temporal patterns of influenza and diarrhea before which has resulted in the publication and submission of peer-reviewed articles in influential journal in the area and conferences abstracts.  Hence Origem is uniquely qualified for elucidating patterns of influenza over time and for implementing the user-friendly interface to inform end users about the causality of diarrhea disease and to continue with performing the specifics tasks above as part of the on-going MISMS.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) order under BOA number N00019-05-G-0008 for testing the Tomahawk U/RGM-109E cruise missile's Guidance Electronics Unit when exposed to fast magnetic field decay rates in the non-operate mode.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Missile.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapon System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to perform the services and engineering support necessary, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe without duplication of cost.

The draft documents are comprised primarily of specifications and drawings, to include the draft Statement of Work and Prime Item Development Specifications for the AN/ARQ-58 RTS and AN/SRQ-4 (Ku) RTS.  The draft documents are being issued to provide potential offerors and other stakeholders the opportunity to provide the CDL Hawlink program with comments and clarifying questions prior to the release of the request for proposal.  A pre-solicitation conference (commonly referred to as “Industry Day”) will be conducted to afford offerors an opportunity to ask clarifying questions on the draft material prior to conclusion of the comment period.  The H-60 Multi Mission Helicopter Program is the acquisition program office for this potential effort.  Instructions are included in this notice on how to request the draft specifications, draft Statement of Work and related materials, how to submit comments, clarifying questions, and responses and how to register for the CDL Hawklink Industry Day.

This program includes information that has been designated as “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department website http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.

Prior to release of any controlled documents under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole-source contract to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT), 1900 Campus Commons Drive, Suite 300, Reston, VA 20191-5464, to perform a hydrodynamic analysis to assess the hydrodynamic performance effects of modifying the nose shape from the present configuration to a hemispherical shape and generate a new hydrodynamic model for use with the autopilot design.  Additionally contractor support is required to perform an autopilot analysis, using the new hydrodynamic model, for the various AQS-20 configurations (e.g., single pass shallow, single pass deep, volume, and identification mode) and tow cables (MH-53, MH-60, Remote Minehunting Vehicle) to assess the impact of the modified nose shape on the autopilot performance.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  Accurate hydrodynamic analysis of the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate hydrodynamic analysis could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  
All deliverables will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. The NAICS is 541330, Small Business Size Standard is $4M, the FSC is AD24.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541430   NAICS Code:541430.  The US Environmental Protection Agency - National Decontamination Team (EPA-NDT) in Erlanger, Kentucky has three 53' mobile chemistry laboratory trailers, a 36' mobile chemistry trailer, a Ford 550 truck, and a 53' mobile chemistry lab bus, all locatedin EPA's NDT Warehouse in Erlanger, KY.  EPA is in search of a small business entity who is skilled in the removal of lettering and logos from the aforementioned vehicles and the application of EPA Logo (flower) on to the vehicles.  The small business must be registered in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) prior to award of purchase order.  The CCR Website is: www.ccr.gov 
The area where the lettering/logos are removed must be buffed and cleaned in such a way that little or no "ghosting" of what was there can be seen.  Once all of the previous lettering and logos are removed from each of the six vehicles, the round US EPA Emergency Response (flower) logo needs to be applied to  both doors of the truck and both sides and the roof of the trailers and bus.  A digital logo will be provided by EPA.
The lettering to be removed reads as follows: "Homeland Security" on the doors of the trucks and "Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, Portable High-Throughput Integrated Laboratory Identification System" on the sides of the trailers.  The lettering is 17" x 7" on both doors of the Ford 550 truck; 30" x 12" in two locations and 35" x 4" in two other locations on the three trailers;  36' x 15" in two locations and 40" x 5" in two other locations of the 36' trailers; 84" x 12" on two locations of the bus.
ALL work must be done on-site at the EPA Emergency Response Warehouse in Erlanger, KY.
Interested vendors may submit a quote via email  to the US Environmental Protection Agency, c/o Elaine Scott no later than 12 noon, EST, July 30, 2008 to: scott.elaine@epa.gov.  Any comments or questions may be submitted via the aforementioned email address as well.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   NAICS Code:334519.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, Headquarters, Emergency Response Service Center, Mail Code 3805R, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20460 intends to award a sole source order to RAE Systemslocated in San Jose, California based on the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1 for the following items: Eight Wireless ChemRAE Portable Chemical Warfare Agent Detector Kits (with modem).  RAE Systems is the only known manufacturer of these kits.  
These kits detect chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals and allows EPA's Emergency Response Team (ERT) to monitor chemical warfare agents remotely via radio frequency using the AreaRae Systems already owned by ERT.  Being able to remotely detect warfare agents provides added safety for the employees operating these detectors.  The ChemRae kits are the only known chemical warfare agenct detector kits that are compatible with and can accommodate ERT's AreaRae System.  
To purchase other remote chemical agent monitoring systems would cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE.
The EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Protection Agency, c/o Elaine Scott: scott.elaine@epa.gov. no later than 12 Noon EST, July 30, 2008.  The determination not to compete this requirement is at the discretion of the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).

The purpose of this purchase order is to obtain the Total Assurance Plan (TAP) and the MassLynx Software one year service plan for the following systems: Waters/Micromass ZQ LC/MS (including ZQ MS detector and instrument software), Waters/Micromass Quattro Premier LC/MS/MS (covers all components of the LC system including- Acquity Tunable UV Dector, Acquity Sample Manager, Acquity Solvent Manager degasser, and the Quattro Premier detector), and the Waters/Micromass Quattro Micro LC/MS/MS (including Quattro Micro MS/MS detector and instrument software).  The service plan shall also include one performance maintenance visit to assure peak operation of the system. The NAICS is 334516.  The period of performance will be 08/01/08 through 07/31/09.  
The ACB Laboratory evaluates analytical methods for detecting pesticide residues in food and fibers to make sure they are suitable for monitoring pesticide residues in food and to enforce maximum legal residue limits.  ACB requires maintenance and software updates for the equipment listed above.  Market research has identified Waters Corporation as being the only provider of maintenance and repair of the Micromass Spectrometers on an annual basis, rather than on an as needed and therefore more costly basis. 
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Rebecca Hindin, Contract Specialist at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov by 11:00 AM ET on Monday, July 28, 2008.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
All questions should be directed to Rebecca Hindin, Contract Specialist via e-mail at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Study:  Is Nursing Home Quality Affected by Corporate Structure?
<SOLNBR>08EASPE000039
<RESPDATE>080608
<CONTACT>Michellee Edwards, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-6412, Fax 301-443-2761, Email michellee.edwards@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a contract with Harvard University located in Cambridge, MA on a sole source basis for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)/Office of the Secretary for a study entitled “Is Nursing Home Quality Affected by Corporate Structure?”  The acquisition is for a one year period. 

Purpose - Many people believe that facilities owned by private equity firms have poorer quality of care than other ownership arrangements.  An article in the New York Times stating this belief triggered hearings by both the House and the Senate in the fall of 2007 and again in the spring of 2008. While this is a common belief, no careful research has been undertaken to systematically address this important policy question.

Background - A major concern with restructuring or buy-outs by private equity firms is that private equity firms operate free of oversight and public accountability. Information that a facility is owned by a private equity firm or any third-party ownership is not reported on Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare website, for example. As more national chains move toward divestiture and corporate restructuring, consumer groups and labor unions have voiced concerns that private equity ownership of nursing home chains and corporate holding of physical assets by REIT groups result in poorer quality of care.   No effort has examined the corporate structure to see if there is a difference among private equity ownership (e.g., “Wall Street” investors vs. pension groups) or if non-profit facilities have third-party relationships that are similar to private equity ownership that may also impact on quality.

CMS Provider Enrollment Chain Ownership System (PECOS) is intended to capture detailed ownership information whenever a nursing home changes ownership. However, two problems exist with the PECOS data. First, the data is incomplete according to CMS officials, and second, the data collected may not capture all individuals with ownership less than 5 percent, the management contracts, real estate divestitures and other corporate restructuring that nursing home chains have implemented. 

The State of Texas has been collecting detailed information on ownership, down to the individual investor level, starting in 2000. This means that individual persons or corporations that have any ownership stake in the facility are identified. The Texas Ownership Management and Tracking (OMT) system includes detailed information on ownership to the individual investor level and also collects information on management contracts.  We think that the level of data in the Texas data is essential and, in conjunction with federal survey data and federal quality indicator data, could sharpen our understanding of the relationship between ownership and quality.

Summary of Approach - The study will be secondary data analysis of nursing homes with varying corporate structures using the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data, quality measure results based on the minimum data set (MDS), and Texas’s Ownership Management and Tracking System (OMT) to more closely examine changing nursing home corporate restructuring and its relationship to quality of care in Texas nursing homes. The OMT system includes detailed information on ownership to the individual investor level and also collects information on management contracts.  It is fully developed, while PECOS is not. The nursing homes in Texas are not necessarily representative of nursing homes nationally. However, this project absolutely requires detailed ownership data that are not available for nursing homes nationally.

Texas OMT data will identify the change in ownership over time, from 2000 to 2007, or the latest year that data are available, and will describe corporate structures found. Information on deficiencies and staffing levels from the OSCAR database will be matched to corporate structure data in order to analyze the effect of corporate structure on quality for nursing homes in Texas.

Policy Research Questions - This project will address policy research questions including, but not limited to, the following:

•	What are the corporate structures of nursing homes in Texas and how have they changed over time? What relationships exist between the business entities holding the nursing home license and any third-party ownership, such as private equity firms? How do corporate structures differ by for-profit and non-profit facilities? 
•	How does corporate structure, third-party ownership (such as private equity firm), multi-facility status, profit status and other facility characteristics affect quality and staffing?

ASPE intends to produce one comprehensive report during this one-year project. The report will discuss the types of corporate structures, the current ownership by private investment firms, the change of ownership over time, and the impact of corporate structure on quality as measured by deficiencies, quality measures, and staffing.  

The contractor should be the familiar with the content and have access to OSCAR, quality measures data, and the Texas OMT data. The contractor shall present a discussion of the generalization of using data from only nursing homes in Texas, including the usefulness of the study given these limitations. This study will look at the effect of corporate structure on quality and staffing in nursing homes. However, other factors also affect quality. The contractor shall be familiar with the trends in nursing home quality and the factors that affect quality, and shall present how these other factors will be controlled in this study.

Harvard University has sole access to this proprietary database.  Detailed ownership data are essential to this project. Texas collects the person or corporation who has any portion of ownership in the business of providing nursing homes services in the state. In addition the data identifies partnerships and contractual arrangements for services. The premise of this project is to determine the effect of different ownership and corporate structure on quality of care in nursing homes. Without complete ownership information, we would not be able to identify corporate structure and the effect on quality. Only Harvard currently has access to the data.

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government’s requirement by August 6, 2008.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to Harvard University.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   8(a) Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Administrative Facilities in the Northwest Region (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY)<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicita tion will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail to Errette.J.Slick@usace.army.mil <BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC ), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to fin d ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% re duction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warr ior in Transition (WIT) barracks and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery In definite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities - The scope  consists of but is not limited to the following administrative facilities as separate or combined tasks:<BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel a ssigned to work in those facilities.

BN HQ facilities shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for Buildings and Facilities.  BN HQs will have private offices.  The BN HQ facility will provide a staff duty station at the building entrance/receptio n area.  Every HQ BN will provide a Secure Communications Room with a Secret Internet Protocol Router network (SIPRNET) connectivity in accordance with latest criteria.<BR><BR>The administrative building function is to provide soldier mission direction and  operational needs requirements.  This facility will operate in a similar manner as the Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building.<BR><BR>Lawn Equipment Storage Build ings (LEB) will provide adequate storage for maintenance equipment and materials used in the grounds-keeping and care of the BT site.  The LEBs will prevent un authorized access and protect maintenance equipment from outdoor elements, including rain and snow.  <BR><BR>Both the AIT and BT related construction includes Outside Areas, including a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service acce ss drives and parking areas.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dudley Achu Sama; Principal Engineer and Technical Adviser; Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MINEE); P.O Box 308; Yaoundé, CAMEROON; Phone: +237 2223 5608; Fax: +237 2223 5608 or +237 2222 6177.  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Feasibility Study.

A country of 17 million people, Cameroon hosts one of the more dynamic economies in the Gulf of Guinea region, on the West Coast of Africa. Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the country faces challenges similar to those in many other developing countries: macroeconomic mismanagement, weak regulatory and judicial systems, and weak financial accountability.  Further, the Government of Cameroon and the World Bank consider power shortages to be one of the key constraints to the country’s economic growth. The nation has an installed production capacity of 935 megawatts (MW), 720 MW of which is hydro-based and the rest oil-fired thermal plants. However, the country’s effectively functioning productive capacity is at present only 450 MW. This shortfall is due to a lack of efficient maintenance, the use of aged facilities and equipment, and the effect of variable climatic conditions.

Cameroon has the hydropower resource capability to provide electricity for 100% of its population for decades to come, with substantial surpluses for export to neighboring countries. Through its membership in the Central African Power Pool, Cameroon has a built-in export market to countries that suffer from chronic power shortages. This combination of surplus potential in hydro-power generating capacity in Cameroon and severe energy shortages in easily reachable neighboring countries establishes a realistic potential for electric-power exports.

The objective of the feasibility study is to develop a technical and financial roadmap for the development of a 75 MW hydroelectric power plant at Bini à Warak, on the Bini River in Cameroon.  Specifically, the study will assist the Cameroonian Ministry of Energy and Water Resources in examining the potential for hydroelectric power generation for export to Chad, and possibly Nigeria as well.

The proposed power plant is very high priority for the Government of Cameroon, receiving specific mention from Prime Minister Inoni during his 2007 address to the National Assembly.  It also serves to augment the newly established Central African Power Pool which promotes interconnectivity and exports and imports of electricity between various countries in the region.

The Feasibility Study would be composed of the following elements (please note that the full Terms of Reference and requirements for this study are located in Annex 4 of the Request for Proposal):

• Purpose and Objective of Study
• Technical Assessment
• Economic Analysis 
• Financial Analysis 
• Environmental and Social Impact Analysis
• Review of Related Regulatory Issues
• Analysis of Key Host Country Development Impacts
• US Sources of Supply
• Implementation Plan

Cameroon: Limbé Gas to Electricity Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Cameroon Ministry of Energy and Water Resources.

The Government of Cameroon considers power shortages to be one of the key constraints to its economic growth. The nation has an installed production capacity of 935 MW but the country’s effectively functioning productive capacity is, at present, only 450 MW. This shortfall is caused by various factors including: reliance on aged facilities and equipment, the effect of harsh climatic conditions, and a lack of long term maintenance. The performance of the power sector since 2001 has been disappointing, as severe droughts have limited the supply of water, which is the source of 90 percent of the electric power produced in Cameroon. To guard against outages in the dry season, Cameroon must decrease its dependency on hydropower through diversification of its power supply.

Like other oil-producing countries in the region, Cameroon previously focused on oil production and flared unused associated gas.  While exploring for crude oil, several off-shore gas fields were found in Cameroon.  Some of these fields remained undeveloped because at the time they offered little potential for commercial development. Among those fields is the off-shore Isongo Marine Gas Field, located 35 km from the coastal city of Limbé on the northern coast of Cameroon.  Intensified seismic surveying and exploratory drilling have discovered several other fields near the Isongo Marine Field, including the Isongo C, D, E, and F Fields. Two of these fields, Isongo E and F, are being considered for development as a source of fuel for the 400 MW Limbé power plant.  The permit for these fields is held by EurOil Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the international oil company BowLeven Plc., and EurOil would supply the feedstock to fuel the Limbé power plant.  The initial off-taker would be the Government of Cameroon, though the transmission system will be licensed to a regulated monopoly under the Government’s ongoing policy to create competition in the sector.  
	
The overall project involves a series of major interdependent investment projects that will have to be balanced as to production, throughput, consumption volumes, and long-term price commitments. The Limbé power plant plans call for a total plant capacity of 400 MW, which would include the conversion to natural gas of an existing 85 MW heavy- fuel-oil-fired reciprocating power plant and the addition, at the same site, of 315 MW of new-plant capacity. The new construction will be a combined-cycle, gas-fired plant built in two or three phases (depending on plant configuration) taking into consideration the immediacy of need, capacity, load balancing in a fragile transmission system, and cost. The Limbé power plant is currently connected to the southern grid through a 15 km 90 KV transmission line, which does not have the capability to accommodate output from a 400 MW power plant. Reinforcement by a second 90 KV line to the network and the construction of a 60 km 225 KV line to Douala, plus requisite transformers, ancillary control, and protection equipment are part of the Limbé Gas to Electricity Project. These additions would enable delivery of power to the commercial center of Cameroon.

Raphael Nbogni; Managing Director; Seaquest Infotel Niger, S.A; Boite Postale 817; Niamey, NIGER; Phone: (227) 2073 96 02; Fax:  (227) 2073 96 03.

Niger: National ICT Backbone Network Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Seaquest InfoTel Niger, S.A. 

Niger has a severe lack of telecommunications backbone capacity, as well as a lack of affordable connectivity to neighboring countries and to the international undersea cable, the SAT-3, off the coast of West Africa.  Lack of a backbone means that Niger is forced to rely on expensive satellite connections resulting in high local and international telecommunications costs, limited bandwidth capacity, and inter-operability problems among local carriers.  Niger has a very active mobile telecommunications sector, and several operators have begun construction of limited fiber infrastructure. However, none of the local carriers has completed 1) a modern local fiber optic/wireless loop in major cities; 2) intercity landline fiber/wireless connections; or 3) a landline connection via neighboring countries to the SAT-3 cable.

Seaquest InfoTel plans to build a fiber optic backbone infrastructure to support ICT infrastructure development in Niger, transport voice and data, as well as radio and television signals on a nationwide and regional basis. Seaquest InfoTel recently completed a similar project in Mali. 

Seaquest InfoTel intends to build a local telecommunications company in Niger on a “carrier’s carrier” model, meaning other operators would route calls over the Seaquest InfoTel network. If deemed feasible, this model may utilize the fiber laid by other companies in Niger. Seaquest InfoTel would focus on the following four business segments:

i)Open access wholesale capacity to support inter-connectivity between operators and to backhaul international telecom traffic to the SAT-3 undersea cable,
ii)Service provision access for local businesses,
iii)Provision of general telephone services, and 
iv)Provision of network and specialist services to national and local government.

Seaquest InfoTel specifically requested the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) help in conducting a Feasibility Study and providing technical assistance related to the following key requirements for developing and deploying a fiber optic backbone in Niger:

If the Project is implemented, it would provide fiber optic backbone connectivity, significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Niger. The Project will also build connections to Niger's neighboring countries, enabling greater communication and trade linkages to develop throughout the region.

•Verification of planned technical network design and specifications (including whether Seaquest InfoTel could use the unlit fiber laid by other operators);
•Verification of estimated Project costs;
•Validation of market analysis and business plan;
•Evaluation of the regulatory and legal framework.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $442,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

ALB infestations are currently within Middlesex and Union Counties in New Jersey and in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York.  Should ALB infestations be detected in other locations, then chemical treatments may be required in other states.  

The chemical treatments for the ALB Program are applied during the months of March through June.  The number of DBH inches treated on an annual basis could vary.  For planning purposes, this could range from 900,000 DBH inches to 400,000 DBH inches annually.  In order to qualify for this service, contractors must have the skills, experience and resouces to complete the chemical treatments on all the ALB host trees within the designated area and time period identified by APHIS.  

Minimum Skills and Experience

2.	All licenses, registrations, and permits required by the state to apply pesticides to soil, trees, etc.
3.	Bonded and insured at the minimum levels established by the state, or by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is greater.  
4.	Minimum of three years of arboriculture experience.
5.	Prior commercial contracts performing application of soil injection and / or trunk injection treatments for trees within the last three years.
6.	Documentation shall be provided to USDA demonstrating the size, scope, and success of prior soil injection tree treatments and /or trunk injection treatment contracts.
7.	At least one full time arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture, employed by the company on a full time basis, who will be dedicated to work on the treatment contract for the duration of the contract. 
8.	The Contractor must train, test, and certify in writing that all field personnel engaged in applications or supervision for this contract are able to identify ALB host material.  Certification should only be made if field personnel achieve a 90% or better on host identification testing.  
9.	All Contractor applicator personnel will be trained and certified to conduct chemical treatments using all methods included in the Statement of Work for the Asian longhorned beetle treatment contracts.  Currently the methods used by the program include, trunk injection with Mauget capsules, trunk injection with the Arborjet tree injection system, and basal soil injection.
10.	The Contractor shall comply with the United States Department of Labor (DOL), “Occupational Safety and Health Administration,” regulations, Volume 36, Number 105, applicable DOL wage rates and fringe benefits, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service laws, all other rules and regulations that may be applicable.
11.	The Contractor shall take full responsibility to ensure that a complete and thorough background check comparable to the government background check, National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI), is conducted and that the contractor employees pass the background check.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Companies capable of providing the defined services are encouraged to respond by providing their company names, points of contact, both phone number and email address and a 5- 10 page statement of capabilities and relevant corporate background, business size, and GSA Schedule Contract Number, if any.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA,) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC,) Oklahoma City, OK, contemplates the follow-on procurement of food services.  The FAA will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for conducting a competitive procurement as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS.)  The acquisition will be conducted using a two-phase approach.
Contract performance for the base period will commence on January 1, 2009.  The base contract shall be for a period of five (5) years.  At the unilateral option of the government, the CO may extend the base contract thereafter for additional terms of from one (1) to five (5) years.  In no event, however, shall the base contract and the extended contract or additional periods exceed a period of 15 years.
No revenue will flow back to the FAA.
This Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR No. 1) commences the procurement process with an invitation to interested parties to submit pre-qualifying information that will be used by the FAA to conduct a down select.  Only those parties who successfully pass the down select process will be allowed to participate in the second phase of this procurement.  The second phase of this procurement, consisting of a technical proposal evaluation, will be fully identified in future communications with those firms that successfully qualify during the down select process.
I. Overview of Current Food Services and Definition of Need:  The FAA has a continuing need for food services at the MMAC.  Presently the MMAC food services program consists of two large cafeteria facilities, one small satellite cafeteria facility and one specialty bakery/coffee shop, two snack bars and an estimated 45 automated vending sites with each area having between one and five machines.  These facilities serve a combined customer base of approximately 5,000 employees and students and are more specifically described below: 	The ARB large facility cafeteria is currently undergoing renovation.  It is centrally located at the MMAC in the Aviation Records Building (ARB.)  It will offer a variety of food stations and action stations (made to order) for breakfast and lunch.  In addition, an extensive grab-n-go section will be made available.  It will seat approximately 400 people and will be the primary eating facility.	The Headquarters' Facility is located in the Headquarters Building.  It is proposed that this location will be converted into a conference/banquet facility and a specialty shop; e.g. submarine/salad shop, coffee shop, bakery, etc.  This is a primary eating facility. 	The satellite cafeteria, known as The Market Place Caf, is located in the Technical Support Facility (TSF) building.  This facility provides limited breakfast and lunch fare.  The caf mostly serves the 280 employees located in the TSF building; however, the caf is open to all MMAC employees for lunch.	The ARB Small Facility is currently operated as a specialty shop that features coffee, tea, pastries and a limited lunch menu.  It seats approximately 40 people.	The two snack bars and all automated vending sites are independently managed and operated under permit issued to the Oklahoma State Department of Rehabilitation Services pursuant to provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act.  The menu consists of some hot items for breakfast and a variety of hot and cold lunch items.  These operations are exclusively reserved for operation by the State of Oklahoma DRS.
The FAA at MMAC is working to provide for its employees a mix of facilities that will deliver fresh, quality food at a good value.  Paramount in the selection of a food service provider will be identification of a contractor with a proven track record of focusing on the needs of the customer, developing innovative solutions and delivering a successful food program.  FAA's short and long-range plans at the MMAC include:	A centralized food court offering a variety of both branded and non-branded food concepts.	A conference center where catered meals can be provided for various sizes of functions and events.	Specialty shops that offer specialty products, e.g. bakery, ice cream shop, soup and sandwich shop, etc.
II. Request for Information:  Accordingly, the FAA has determined the following screening criteria must be met by interested parties in order to pass the down select and be invited to participate in the competitive procurement process which will begin with the issuance of SIR No. 2:(1) The contractor has been in the regular business of providing the services sought for the last three years.  The contractor's documented experience shall include identification of at least two previous or on-going contracts.  The following minimum information is required:	Previous contract number, if applicable, and contract type.	Contracting agency or business name; e.g. DOD, FAA, NASA, any federal or state agency, commercial entity, etc.	Dates of performance and a brief description of the contract effort.

This information should include current and previous years' balance sheets, income statements and Statement of Cash Flows.(4) The contractor must provide literature describing the company's organizational structure, business and management philosophy and services provided demonstrating the capability to provide food services of the highest quality.  
For a more detailed description of the requirement, see the draft Statement of Work (SOW) accompanying this SIR No. 1.
The FAA will conduct the down select in the following manner:	(1) FAA reserves the right to ask an offeror to provide references and to contact the reference to verify the information.  Any statement included in an offeror's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be grounds for immediate rejection by the Contracting Officer during the down select screening process.	(2) Responses to this SIR No. 1 will be evaluated as "acceptable" or "unacceptable."  The Product Team's decision as to what is "acceptable" or "unacceptable" is final.  To pass this initial screening process, offerors must be found "acceptable" on all criteria.  It is the responsibility of each offeror to conclusively demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government that they meet all of the specified minimum qualification requirements in this SIR No. 1.	(3) Oral or written communications with offerors during the down select process will be conducted only if the FAA deems communication is necessary.	(4) Prior to the review and evaluation of the information by the Product Team, the contracting office will screen all responses for incomplete packages.  Incomplete packages will not be referred to the Product Team for review and evaluation.	(5) A formal request for technical proposals in the form of SIR No. 2 will be issued only to those offerors who meet the screening criteria of this SIR No. 1.  SIR No. 2 will describe additional screening criteria required to be addressed in the offeror's technical proposal.  A copy of the SOW is provided with this SIR.  Offerors are cautioned that the attached SOW is considered a draft and is subject to change anytime prior to the award of a formal contract.
The contract will be awarded by the Government to the responsible offeror who provides the best overall approach to the Government and conforms to the requirements contained in the solicitation unless the State Licensing Agency (SLA) for the Blind submits an offer, which is determined to be in the final competitive range.  If the SLA meets the Government's requirement, it will be awarded the contract in accordance with the Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 107).
III. Preparation Guidelines:  Offerors are cautioned to provide only the documentation requested and necessary in order to facilitate the screening process.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond that sufficient to present a complete and effective response are neither necessary nor desired.  All documentation shall be in narrative form, typewritten (no smaller than 12 point type) and limited to 20 pages (8 " x 11", printed on one side.)  Brochures and other pre-printed company literature are not counted toward the 20-page limit.  Failure to comply with the page limitation may be cause for rejection of an offeror's response.  FAA Product Team members will be instructed to read only up to the page limit specified.  Offerors should readily identify the information in their responses by providing an index or separate cover sheet for each screening criterion numbered 1 through 4 in Section II above.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.

NIAID’s role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of animal models helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  For example, animal models are used to evaluate product candidates; provide data in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; guide the selection of human dose levels and the design of clinical studies/trials; and provide pivotal efficacy data for products to be licensed under FDA’s “Animal Efficacy Rule” (21 CFR 314.610 and 601.91), when clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.  In addition, for emerging and rare diseases, understanding the disease in animals may provide relevant information when little can be learned directly from humans.  Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing animal models to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, animal model services and other research resources are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services and resources by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Animals Models of Infectious Diseases program, which will utilize the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.  Animal models currently covered by existing pathogen-specific contracts will not be re-competed separately upon completion; however, they could be awarded as task orders under this program, upon expiration of those contracts.  

DMID is also establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources (MID-BRR) program, which will serve as a central repository for microbiology and infectious disease researchers. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of pathogens that must be grown in animals and reagents integral to research on these organisms.

This acquisition will provide for the following services:

1.Part A - Small Animal Models – Will support the development and use of small animal models for routine screening and early efficacy testing for products against a wide range of pathogens.
2.Part B - GLP Small Animal Models – Will support the refinement and use of existing small  animal models in preparation for the conduct of GLP studies, as well as GLP testing of products against a wide range of pathogens.
3.Part C - Non-Human Primate Models – Will support the development, refinement and use of non-human primate models, and may include both GLP and non-GLP studies, for testing products against a wide range of pathogens.
4.Part D - Nontraditional Animal Models – Will support the development, refinement and use of  non-traditional animal models, and may include both GLP and non-GLP studies, for testing products against a wide range of pathogens.

For the purposes of this acquisition:
•Small animals (Parts A and B) are defined as traditional small laboratory animal species, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, chinchillas, and rabbits. 
•Non-human primates (Part C) include various species, such as macaques, including Chinese and Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomyologous macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), etc.  Excluded are baboons and chimpanzees.
•Nontraditional animals (Part D) are defined as specialty laboratory animal species not covered in Small Animal or Non-Human Primate Models (Parts A – C), which may have requirements not met in typical biomedical laboratory animal facilities, such as armadillos, woodchucks, snails, other invertebrates, and goats, swine, horses, cattle, etc.
•Products to be evaluated in these animal models are broadly defined to include vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g. microbicides), therapeutics targeting the host or the pathogen, including immunotherapeutics, and diagnostics.   Products will be provided to the Contractor by the Project Officer or a third party after Project Officer approval. 
•Pathogens of interest must be pathogens of human concern and not only of animal concern; however surrogate human pathogen/animal combinations may be used for diseases where human pathogens cannot be studied in animal models.    
•Pathogens are defined as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, toxins, and other agents such as prions, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). 
•Reagents are defined as biochemical, genomic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic materials integral to research on these pathogens.

Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors’ qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following:

Technical Capability: adequacy and appropriateness of the general technical approach to animal model studies, to include conduct of product efficacy studies, animal model development, and supportive measurements (immunological, pharmacological, clinical, pathological, etc.); technical approach to pathogen production and characterization, including overall understanding of the pathogen and its behavior in animal models.  In addition, capability to comply with Good Laboratory Practices (21 CFR Part 58) will be evaluated for Part B, Part C and Part D.

Personnel and Project Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity; adequacy and appropriateness of proposed organization and staffing to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, conduct, and completion of all activities, including plans for communication and sharing of research resources.  

Facilities, Equipment and other Resources: availability of adequate, accredited animal facilities, with biocontainment appropriate for the pathogens proposed; availability of equipment necessary for the proposed animal studies; and adequacy of institutional biosafety program.

Past Performance:  Past performance is considered essential. In addition to demonstrating that they have met the above qualifications, interested parties must identify at least three other projects of similar size and complexity.

All capable small business organizations are encouraged to submit capability statements based on this announcement.  Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by August 7, 2008. Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked (see Government-Wide Numbered Note 22).

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) colorimetric or explosive detection equipment (EDE) requiring visual interpretation by the operator.  Interpretation of resulting colors or changes can be automated or performed by the operator.  The EDE needs to be capable of determining the presence of explosives in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that are contained in mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and on personnel.  This market survey solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance.  NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select EDE systems for comparative testing and evaluation.  A report will be written and made available for use by government agencies and military services.  Technologies for IED detection that protect the force and prevent terrorist bombings against military personnel, equipment, and military installations by finding them at points of entry are sought.  Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find IEDs effectively and reliably, while inspecting mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and personnel (to include personal articles carried by personnel) for IEDs at military installations' entry points without slowing throughput.  Our intent is to test technologically mature and market ready equipment.  Currently, we plan to test and evaluate up to eight systems. *The following performance parameters will be assessed throughout the test: *1.0 Detection Effectiveness*1.1 The IED may include the following explosives: ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, SEMTEX, chlorates, water gels, black powders, smokeless powders, perchlorates, peroxides, and dynamites. *2.0 Detection Speed
*3.0 Ease of Use*4.0 Transportability/Portability *5.0 Reliability *6.0 Maintainability *The standard conditions and representative IEDs are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each EDE features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements.*1.0 Representative IEDs shall be used as objects of interest that contain typical explosives that might convey through the point of entry.  The IEDs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in or on mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. *2.0 Typical Operational Scenario:  EDE will be used to non-intrusively inspect mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves that might convey through the point of entry. *3.0 Typical Environmental Conditions:  The point of entry will have standard U.S. electrical power supply of 110v ac/220v ac @ 50-60 Hz.  Ambient weather/climatic conditions are expected to: A) range from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit; B) range from 10 to 95% humidity; C) barometric pressure ranges from sea level to 3000 feet above sea level; and D) may contain saltwater spray, dust, rain, or snow. *4.0 Typical Operator Abilities: The operator is: A) a soldier, sailor, airman, marine or security personnel, B) supplied with vendor's written manuals, and C) trained by the manufacturer on the proper operation of the equipment. *If you submitted your system to the 2007 sources sought notice (N0464A070002-Handheld, Colorimetric or Additional EDE), you do not need to resubmit.  A demonstration of technical maturity may be required to support down selection. Interested firms are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, points of contact, a technical description of five or fewer pages, and business size.  Please provide a quad chart in the attached format.  Submit only one quad chart for each model (only one version per model) of your EDE.  Please address technical questions to Denice Lee at (301) 744-5143 or email denice.lee@navy.mil.*1.0 Technical Description Format *1.1 Vendor information: company name, address, points of contact, email addresses, telephone numbers, and related webpages, if applicable. *1.2 System: EDE name and model. *1.3 Function: Objects of interest that EDE can inspect for the explosives in IEDs (for example, mail, small parcels, and personal articles carried by personnel). *1.4 System Picture. *1.5 Technology: A brief description of the technology used by this product.*1.6 Size. Outside dimensions in feet and inches.  Weight of each component in pounds. *1.7 Limitations/Hazards/Special Requirements: state any special EDE limitations, hazards and/or special requirements such as radiation sources or toxic chemicals.  Include a copy of radioactive material license documentation from nuclear regulatory commission and MSDs, if applicable. *1.8 Special Features/Capabilities: Summarize any special EDE features or capabilities not contained herein that improve the overall ability of the EDE to find IEDs.  State whether EDE has ability to detect other classes of chemical compounds or other distinguishing characteristics unique to an IED beyond those cited here. *1.9 Validated Test Results: Summary of vendor and/or third party certifications and/or documented results of testing .*2.0 Definitions Colorimetric detection  instrumentation or kits utilizing color changes for the detection of explosives. Visual Interpretation  instrumentation requiring an operator to visually determine a change occurred which may or may not be due to a color reaction. Explosive Detection Equipment  devices that determine the presence of characteristics of energetics/explosive materials. Improvised Explosive Devices  an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb. Objects of Interest  the subject matter of attention, for example, mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. Performance Parameter  capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment. Point of Entry  the passageway through a protected perimeter through which all personnel, mail, cargo, and vehicles pass.*This announcement serves to survey product availability, and is not a formal solicitation and is not an RFP.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All data received in response to this Sources Sought that is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the Government.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for the cost of submitting information.  Each submission shall be transmitted electronically to: Jim Knesel, code 052 at james.e.knesel@navy.mil.

<DESC>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue a proposed award under other than full and open competition to The Corporate Executive Board for a base year with four (4) option periods for Corporate Leadership Council (CLC) membership. The Human Capital Office (HCO) has made use of this membership to identify key human capital metrics, benchmark succession planning and mentoring practices, and evaluated different strategies to meeting various human capital needs. GAO analysts also use the information in GAO’s mission human capital work in support of the Congress.  The membership also allows GAO staff working on engagements access to up to date best practice research.  GAO has identified human capital management as a high risk area for all the federal government.  
 
GAO’s membership with the Corporate Leadership Council supports GAO’s role as a leader in strategic human capital management and directly contributes to GAO’s goal of being a model federal agency and a world-class professional services organization.  CLC Membership provides GAO managers and staff access to a broad range of best practice research and tools on strategic management and business performance issues faced by public and private sector organizations.  CLC membership includes unlimited access to human capital-related research results and customized research services; benchmarking and decision support tools; networking with CLC’s member organizations; and participation in meetings and teleconferences on emerging human capital and business issues.  Through this membership, GAO mission support employees may access a vast array of data and other tools to assess ways for continuously improving the human capital services we deliver to GAO managers and staff.  

There are no other companies or individuals known to provide similar services.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.    END

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service intends to issue and award to the Anton Paar USA, Ashland, VA on a sole source basis.  Award will be made pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     

The U.S. Department of Agriculture proposes to sole source purchase the SurPASS Electrokinetic Analyzer. 
Description of Supplies/Services:  The SurPASS Electrokinetic Analyzer measures surface charge directly on cotton fabrics of a wide variety.  It is equipped with an auto-titration capability which enables the user to study changes in the zeta potential with respect to changes in pH.  The enormous flexibility of the SurPASS measuring cells enables the zeta potential analysis of solids of almost any size and shape. The range of applications starts with powder samples of particle size from some tenth of microns to more than one millimeter. The same measuring cell accomodates fibre material of different origin like glass, carbon or textile fibres. The step towards samples with planar surfaces only requires the exchange of the measuring cell.  This technological feature involving direct measurement of zeta potential on whole textiles fibers is not available in any other instrument sold in the U.S.
Shall be delivery FOB to the USDA, ARS, SRRC, New Orleans, Louisiana.  

Responses are to be received within 5 days of this notice.     The NAICS Code/Size is 333292. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.     No telephone inquiries will be accepted.     No solicitation will be issued.     Questions can be e-mailed to ida.lirette@ars.usda.gov.

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Pen, Retractable .7MM Blue (Vista Secure Gel) by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L). You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov. Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1792</p>
<p><br />The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Pen, Retractable .7MM Blue (Vista Secure Gel) to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>SAN-33951<br />SAN-45532<br /><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Pen, Retractable .7MM Blue (Vista Secure Gel) to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 12, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.</p>

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Self Stick Table Top Easel Pad to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

<CONTACT>Mike Jurkowski, Phone 703-603-2117, Email mjurkowski@jwod.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Self Stick Table Top Easel Pad by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L). You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov. Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0880</p>
<p><br />The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Self Stick Table Top Easel Pad to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>MMM563R</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Self Stick Table Top Easel Pad to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 12, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <BR>The point of contact for this announcement is Randal Halbrooks, Contract Specialist, at randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil.<BR>The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. <BR>    <BR><BR>1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the Delta Fair and Music Festival purchased through Delta Fair Inc., requested by the Recruiting Division of the Tennessee Army National Guard.<BR><BR>2.	This package will feature the Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) in all media advertisements associated with the fair. This package would also include a Tennessee Army National Guard Day, an opportunity for the TNARNG to host an event with a celebrity appearance at the fair, signage opportunities at the Demolition Derby and the Monster Truck Ride areas of the fair and space available at the fair to set up demonstrations in an effort to increase awareness in the TNARNG in an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in the TNARNG. <BR><BR>3.	The total estimated value of this advertising package is $50,000.00.<BR><BR>4.	Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <BR><BR>5.	The Delta Fair and Music Festival is the only organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media at a fair capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to enlist. <BR><BR>6.	Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the Delta Fair Inc. is the only fair in the West Tennessee area capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to enlist.<BR><BR>7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertisement packages of this nature. This same advertising package has been offered to and sold to other commercial vendors.<BR><BR>8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 561920 for Convention and Trade Show Organizers in Tennessee. No other fair organizations in the West Tennessee area were found who could offer an advertisement package that could reach the number of people in the Tennessee National Guards desired demographic group that Delta Fair Inc. could.<BR><BR>9.	Delta Fair Inc. is the only responsible source available who can provide an advertising package of this type in the West Tennessee area. <BR><BR>10.	No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.<BR><BR>11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as Delta Fair is only fair organization in West Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demographic group for potential recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard.<BR><BR>12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Heitech Services, Inc to provide and format for publication reports documenting work on a significant long-term project.  The project involves formatting for publication the reports documenting the investigation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7.  This work is part of the federal building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center disaster led by NIST.  NIST is currently working to complete the investigation and anticipates preparing a summary report on the investigation of WTC 7 and two detailed reports on the investigation, including appendices documenting specific technical topics that were part of the investigation.  The drafts of these reports are expected to be completed in the summer of 2008 and ready for formatting at that time.  NIST will also need some graphics work for the covers of the reports and the labels on the Compact Disks (CD’s) containing these reports.  

Sole source determination is based on Heitech’s specific experience since the contractor has worked on prior versions of the remaining reports and is uniquely positioned to complete the remaining tasks within the tight time frame.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the size standard is $6.5M.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received on or before July 28, 2008; 12:00:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>According to the latest Defense Science Board Energy Report dated February 2008, for Army operations, “during wartime, generators become the largest single fuel consumers on the battlefield”. A high efficiency, advanced power generation unit suitable for both Army and Marine Corp applications could help reduce the battle space fuel burden and help meet the ever increasing power demands for our troops in the battlefield.

The objective of this program is to obtain detailed designs for a modular, compact, high temperature fuel cell system to provide high efficiency, silent power for US Marine Corps (USMC) and other DoD Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) applications. The Office of Naval Research desires to gather and evaluate detailed designs for a Solid Oxide based high temperature fuel cell system with or without compatible energy recovery machinery that can perform the function of an APU capable of operating with JP5, JP8, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel, and zero sulfur synthetic diesel. The fuel cell based APU system design must account for full militarized specifications associated with existing fielded APU systems.  The system should be able to achieve TRL 6 by January 2012 with capability of TRL9 by 2015. THE ESTIMATED DATE FOR RELEASE OF BAA 08-024 IS ON OR ABOUT 11 AUG 08.    Below is the URL with a description of the industry day agenda and location.

<a href="mailto:kevin.comegys@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC><BR>Justification and Approval For Other Than Full And Open Competition<BR><BR><BR>1.	Contracting Activity:  The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is the U. S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5014.  The requiring activity is the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).<BR><BR>2.	Description of Action:  This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed-price contract using R&D funds.<BR><BR>3.	Description of Supplies/Services: The required supplies are used for pyrosequencing on the Roche 454 FLX Genome Sequencer.  The estimated value of this contract is $131,000.<BR><BR>4.	Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed contractor for this action is Roche.  Roche is uniquely qualified to supply the reagents necessary for pyrosequencing on the Roche 454 FLX sequencer.  No other supplier is capable of providing these reagents.  The sequencer and the accompanying reagents are proprietary to Roche and use of any reagents not manufactured by Roche results in a loss of warranty.<BR> <BR>6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Not Applicable.  No effort will be made to solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable as there is only one source capable of performing the required services.  No effective competition is anticipated.<BR><BR>7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  It is not anticipated that there will be another source for these reagents.  Roche has given the government a substantial discount.<BR> <BR>8.	Market Research: Before purchasing the Roche 454 FLX Genome Sequencer, we investigated all three technologies available on the market, including the Applied Biosystems Solid and the Illumina Solexa.  The Roche most closely fit our needs.  I have included a document with the specifications for the three technologies.  Each technology uses different chemistry and as such, the reagents must be purchased from the company that developed the technology.  <BR><BR>9.	Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>10.	Other facts:  <BR>a.  Procurement history.  Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from the computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected:<BR><BR>		i.  Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards.  W74MYF7232N003-006<BR><BR>	ii.  Competitive status of these actions.  This action was a sole source purchase.<BR> <BR>	iii.  Authority previously used for less than full and open competition.<BR><BR>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>iv.  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.<BR>The kits being requested from Roche are for use in our newly acquired Roche 454 FLX Genome Sequencer.  They are the only reagents that will produce results on the equipment.  We will be using the kits to sequence respiratory pathogens of military interest.  The kits are created specifically for use on the Roche 454 FLX genome sequencer.  This system is unique in that it can sequence a full genome in the matter of hours rather than weeks.  The kits designed specifically for this instrument are necessary to obtain usable results.  No other company makes kits to run on this equipment.  Without the kits, we would be unable to utilize an instrument that we just purchased for $475,000.  We do not have the manpower or expertise to develop our own kits to be run on this highly specialized equipment.  Any delay in ordering thses kits would delay any productivity associated with the use of the machine.  No kits = no work completed.<BR>v.  If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances.  Not applicable.<BR><BR>vi.  An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive urgent buys.  Not applicable.<BR><BR>vii.  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.  Not applicable.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>b.  Acquisition data availability.  Explain why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  Describe actions taken or planned to remedy this situation.<BR><BR>It is not being competed because there are no other sources for the reagents and any attempt to use reagents other than those provided by Roche negates the warranty of the $475,000.00 equipment. <BR><BR>	c.  Unusual and compelling urgency.  Not applicable.<BR><BR>d.  Subcontracting competition.  Not applicable.<BR><BR> <BR>11.  Technical Certification:  I justify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR><BR>Typed Name: Date:  DR. AMY KITCHEN     17 July 2008<BR>Title: Signature:  Program Coordinator, Emerging Infectious Disease Research Unit<BR><BR>12.

<DESC>Publication, Information & Sales, P&IS manages inventory, performs order fulfillment, maintains an e-commerce Web site, operates a Contact Center, processes payments, submits invoices, and supports financial management with existing systems and processes.  P&IS system applications support two operations – Main GPO and Pueblo.  Main GPO primarily focuses on the GPO Sales Program, but also fulfills consigned subscriptions for Federal agencies.  Main GPO includes Headquarters, Laurel Warehouse, Bookstore, and Contact Center.  The Pueblo operation, located in Pueblo, CO, primarily focuses on consignment/reimbursable sales from Federal agencies and also stores inventory and fulfills orders for the GPO Sales Program.  

Currently, P&IS is looking to implement a Retail Order Fulfillment System (ROFS) using Oracle applications. The proposed ROFS consists of functionality to support the GPO’s retail management of publications (books, maps, serials, videos, CD-ROMs, and subscriptions) for sale through the Superintendent of Documents as well as the GPO’s order fulfillment services for other Federal agencies.  In addition, the ROFS will support the business operations of its staff. The proposed system encompasses all of the equipment, software, hardware, services, and documentation necessary for operations.

P&IS, akin to other GPO business units, is committed to implementing Oracle applications utilizing an incremental approach with the desire to eventually cease all existing functionality of Legacy systems and interfaces to those Legacy systems. Use of Oracle as an Enterprise Architecture is intended to provide streamlining and improvement of existing business processes. All implementations will be conducted using the Federal Enterprise Application Suite in the On Demand hosted environment in Austin, TX.
2.0		Contract Objectives
The objective of this contract is to obtain services for a single year, multi-release integration effort. The purpose of this effort is to integrate Oracle applications within Oracle On Demand. The applications to be integrated include the iStore (primary) and iPayment  OTS applications; additional modules from the emerging ERP may also be required to meet all specified requirements. The implementation contractor (IC) shall perform in compliance with the most current versions of the P&IS Concept of Operations (ConOps), P&IS Requirements Document (RD), and any other documentation provided as government furnished material (GFM).

The P&IS ROFS shall be developed and implemented jointly by GPO and the IC using GPO’s Information Technology System Development Life Cycle Policy (SDLC) as a framework, but conforming to the Oracle On Demand implementation process. GPO’s SDLC outlines the strategy for facilitating successful execution of IT projects at the GPO through a disciplined system engineering process. Systems development in the GPO environment is a specific effort to automate GPO activity (business processes) by using hardware, software, people, and procedures. It is incumbent upon the IC candidates to understand and present their approach to conforming with the On Demand implementation processes.

GPO plans to utilize a four (4) increment approach to delivering P&IS ROFS functionality. The 
initial increment consists of core functionality with limited or no customization or modifications to the base modules while the second,  third and fourth increment may include customization or other modification to the base modules. For this implementation, interfacing with previously-configured Oracle applications may be required. These applications, from the emerging ERP activity ongoing at GPO, include: Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Fixed Assets, Order Management and Inventory Management. The increments are as follows:
•	Increment One:  All core functionality to display, advertise, and purchase single-copy sale publications to include payment through Pay.gov. 
•	Increment Two: All core functionality to display, advertise, and purchase serial sale publications to include payment through Pay.gov.  Serial sale publications include regular and irregular subscriptions as well as standing orders.
•	Increment Three: All functionality and interfaces required to communicate with book dealers and consignment partners.  This also includes implementing a Web interface and back-end fulfillment system to be utilized by the Pueblo, CO operation for GSA FCIC sales, and establishing an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for agency partners and internal (GPO) customers.
•	Increment Four:  Any additional enhancements not delivered in Increments 1-3.
Using this approach, each release will follow the SDLC driven series of Phases and Gates described in Section 2.5: Phases & Gates and Release Schedule Approach.

Proposal Evaluation

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.  In addition to price, when determining best value, the NLRB will consider the proposed approach to performing space planning and design services for tenant improvements at the Headquarters building, with appropriate consideration given to the following three evaluation factors:

•	Factor 1. Technical
•	Factor 2. Past Performance
•	Factor 3. Price.

The relative importance of the factors, is that, the technical factor is significantly more important than the past performance factor, which is slightly more important than the price factor. The non-price factors combined are significantly more important than the price factor. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for all the factors.  Offerors are to be cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the offeror with lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more Offerors and request revised proposals. 

Technical Factor Approach. This factor will be evaluated based on the extent to which the Offeror concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested.

a.	Technical Excellence – The degree in which the Offeror understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract; the technical approach for accomplishing the work in the SOW; that the Offeror thoroughly understands space planning and design services to provide for problem identification, recordation, resolution, escalation, notification and closeout of issue.  

b. Personnel Qualifications – Offeror shall propose personnel requirements and qualifications, including key personnel and submit resumes for the key personnel.  In addition, the Offeror shall provide “letters of commitment” or “letters of intent” for the key personnel. The resumes shall describe the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed key personnel. The follow positions are identified as key Personnel: Space Management Specialist.
Past Performance Factor.  Past Performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Government’s confidence in the Offerors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Offeror has undertaken within the last 5 years of similar size, scope and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation.  No more than five (5) past performance references shall be submitted.  The following will be evaluated: 

1. Quality of Product or Service – The degree to which the Offeror can show the ability to meet all space design requirements.

2. Timeliness of Performance – The degree in which the Offeror meets established schedules or milestones. 

3. Cost Control – The degree in which the Offeror completes space-related requirements within the established cost estimate.

4. Business Relations – The degree in which the Offeror has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Offerors with no past performance shall so state.
Price.  This factor will be evaluated based on competition, and information supplied in each proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical performance.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non price factors.   After addressing the requirements in this solicitation, the Offeror may submit alternative solutions to the items requested in the price schedule in Attachment II and the Government may consider them. Offerors shall submit a cost breakout that at a minimum, justifies the cost identified by labor category (including wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit) and number of hours used to calculate the monthly rate.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION FOR ARTIFACT CONSERVATION ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation Number is NAMA-08-Q-0078 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition circular 2005-26 effective date June 12, 2008.  The resulting contract will be a hybrid contract with two time-and-materials (T&M) Contract Line Items (CLINs) having fixed unit pricing and one firm-fixed priced CLIN.  CLIN 0001 (Phase 1 - T&M) will include a not-to-exceed (NTE) amount based on the contractor’s estimated hours multiplied by its proposed fully burdened fixed labor rate to provide services outlined in Phase 1.  CLIN 0002 (Phase 2 – FFP) will be the firm fixed price the contractor quotes to provide the requested service outlined for Phase 2.  Both CLINs 0001 and 0002 will have a period of performance of twelve months, which begins on September 1, 2008 and ends on August 31, 2009.  CLINs 0003, 0004, 0005, 0006, 0007 (Phase 3 – T&M) will be optional CLINs, exercised at the discretion of the government, and include NTE amounts of $75,000.00 for services requested for Phase 3.  The following is a list of performance periods for Phase 3 CLINs: 0003 (October 1, 2008 – September 30, 2009); 0004 (October 1, 2009 – September 30, 2010); 0005 (October 1, 2010 – September 30, 2011); 0006 (October 1, 2011 – September 30, 2012); and 0007 (October 1, 2012 – September 30, 2013).  The anticipated award date of the resulting contract is August 25, 2008.  The Government intends to make an award on the initial quotation without discussions for this procurement.  This is a best value acquisition, in that the Government is more concerned with receiving superior services than in making award to the lowest priced offeror.  As such, evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation as prescribed by FAR 12.301(c)(2).  Accordingly, the technical evaluation factors are Technical Understanding and Approach and Relevant Past Performance.  Award will be made to the contractor whose conforming quotation represents the best value to the Government.  An assessment will be made of the Contractor’s technical understanding and overall approach to this project as it relates to the solicitation tasks, and the Contractor’s approach to management of logistics and quality control associated with coordination of these time sensitive efforts.  The Government will also assess the suitability of the Contractor’s management and technical personnel who will work with the Government project manager.  This may include such considerations as personnel qualifications, experience, and staffing including relevant education and training in professional conservation/preservation techniques and practices and specific experience in working with the types of materials, both in terms of age and medium, outlined in this solicitation.  Furthermore, the Contractor will be evaluated to assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar work, to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous work.  In order to evaluate the relevant past performance, the contractor must provide contact information for no more than five references that will be able to verify this particular competency.  All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by NARA.  For a formatted copy of the Statement of Work as well as the Pricing Table necessary for proper response, contact Mr. Darell Taylor.  DESCRIPTION: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) operates the Presidential Libraries documenting the Administrations of Presidents Hoover through Clinton.  These unique institutions serve not only as archives containing millions of pages of primary documents, but also as history museums with repositories of major object collections.  This contract is for the preservation of holdings at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library located at 4079 Albany Post Road, Hyde Park, NY.  The objects to be addressed through this contract include textiles, paintings, and prints.  The Library maintains more specific information about its holdings in its collections management database.  The textiles, paintings, and prints include not only gifts of state received by the President in the course of his official duties, but also gifts from the American people and personal and family items that provide insight into the President’s life and career.  Library collections consist of a wide variety of objects including: ceramics, crafts, decorative objects, framed prints, photographs, images, furniture, glass, jewelry, metals, paintings, personal items, posters and other flat paper-based materials, pottery, sculpture, textiles, wooden objects and composite objects.  NARA requires contract support in three phases of work: (1) Phase 1: The Contractor must undertake a general assessment of three classes of objects: (a) 180 oil paintings of various sizes with varying degrees of accessibility (i.e. frames, under glass, unframed); (b) 9,000 prints, water colors, and works on paper.  Of these, the majority are loose prints with approximately 710 framed and albums.  Between one and two thousand of works on paper are magazine and newspaper clippings of limited value; and (c) 700 textile pieces including approximately 50 articles of clothing, 150 handkerchiefs and ties, 30 folk art flags, 20 ceremonial flags, 200 other flags, and a mix of needlework, quilts, banners, and upholstered items.  The contractors must conduct the general assessment onsite and produce a written report identifying the basic conservation and preservation needs of these broad classes of object(s) stored or exhibited at the Library.  The results of this general assessment will provide guidance in setting priorities for preventative conservation and developing a long-range preservation plan.  It is not anticipated that the conservator(s) will review each item, but rather review the general condition and current storage methods to provide general recommendations for the development and execution of a preventative preservation plan for these collections.  During the on-site assessment, the conservator(s) must provide general training to the museum Registrar and other museum staff on handling and must provide detailed instruction and demonstration on housing techniques recommended for the objects.  The painting conservator must provide training on preventative maintenance procedures appropriate for easel paintings including but not limited to: appropriate tension of canvas; keying out stretcher bars; framing paintings; backing paintings; and hanging paintings.  The textile conservator must provide training on how to choose appropriate storage techniques for textiles (hanging, boxed, rolled, flat) and on how to implement these housing techniques including how to fold and pad garments and flat textiles when they are housed in a box; how to display textiles; and options for appropriate display forms.  The paper conservator(s) must provide training and information on appropriate storage and framing techniques.  Upon completion of the on-site review and training, the contractor’s assessor must meet with designated Library staff to discuss the findings.  The close-out meeting must cover substantially the same subjects and recommendations the contractor’s assessor anticipates including in a written report.  At this time, the contractor’s assessor will gather any data or information not already obtained that will be required for production of the general assessment report.  No later than 30 days after completing each on-site assessment, the contractor must submit the written report in draft form in MS Word format to the COR.  The report must include the following elements: identification of person(s) who conducted the assessment; date of the assessment; identification of Library staff who were involved in the assessment and how they were involved; and a brief summary of the entrance and exit interviews; a general description of the condition of the collections, preservation concerns of note to these specific collections; recommendations for storage techniques and; discussion of other preventative conservation practices or procedures that the assessors recommends for the collection. Prioritization of recommendations must be included in the report.  The report must be thorough to support development and implementation of a long-range preservation plan for the collections.  Photographic images are required as necessary to illustrate findings and/or recommendations.  The contractor must provide the COR five copies of the draft report.  No later than three weeks following the receipt of the draft report, the COR will submit NARA’s recommended changes or edits to the report.  No later than three weeks following the receipt of NARA comments, the contractor must provide the COR five copies of the final report in MS Word format.  (2) Phase 2: The contractor must undertake an item by item survey with complete treatment proposals for objects requiring more detailed examination and professional treatment: (a) 100 oil paintings; (b) 20 framed and 50 unframed prints and watercolors; and (c) 350 textile pieces.  The Contractor shall conduct an on-site, detailed object(s) survey and produce written examination reports and treatment proposals identifying the conservation and preservation needs of individual object(s) or groups of like objects stored or exhibited at the Library.  The Library will pre-select the specific objects that will be surveyed.  The conservator must conduct a hands-on survey of identified object(s) by examining each object individually, or, as appropriate, by examining representative samples of large groups of essentially identical objects.  The following factors must be considered in determining the condition of an object and its conservation treatment needs: the nature of the environment in which the object is stored or exhibited including temperature, relative humidity, dust, natural and artificial light sources, pests, and other agents of deterioration; storage methods, mounts, and techniques including appropriateness, quality, and efficiency of use; evidence of recent damage or deterioration, damage to objects during their use for interpretation and study; deterioration due to inherent vice or natural ageing; any other general or specific issues concerning the object’s preservation, conservation, and/or treatment needs.  The written treatment proposals must include the maximum number of hours required for the proposed treatment and other costs for materials required for a professional conservator to carry out each recommended treatment.  When appropriate, the contractor must note economies of cost or other benefits that might be realized by simultaneously treating similar objects, or objects with similar treatment needs.  The treatment proposal must include a description of the schedule, sequence, procedures, and methodology that will be used in conducting the treatment.  The proposal must also include a prioritization of the urgency of the treatment recommended for the object.  Any materials recommended for treatment must be those commonly used by conservators and selected for reversibility, stability, and ease of use.  Materials must be described generically, though brand names also may be given for reference purposes.  The format used for the examination and treatment proposal must be approved by the COR in advance of the item level survey.  The treatment proposal format must include fields for condition and preservation needs and established terminology used by NARA must be followed when completing these fields.  The treatment proposals must be summarized in an MS Access database supplied by NARA.  Information to be summarized includes condition and treatment needs and cost estimates for each item.  This database must use key elements from the Library’s collections management software, iO, so that information in the database may be imported into the Library’s collections management software.  Upon completion of the item by item condition and proposed treatment surveys, the contractor must meet with designated Library staff to discuss the findings.  The close-out meeting must cover substantially the same subjects and recommendations the surveyor anticipates including in the treatment proposals.  At this time, the contractor will gather any data or information not already obtained that will be required for production of the written treatment proposals.  No later than 30 days after completing the on-site assessment, the contractor must submit a the written examination and proposed treatment reports in draft form in MS Word and the draft MS Access database to the COR.  The contractor must provide five copies of the draft treatment proposals.  No later than three weeks following the receipt of the draft proposals, the COR will submit NARA’s recommended changes or edits to the proposals.  No later than three weeks following the receipt of NARA comments, the contractor must provide five copies of the final treatment proposals in MS Word and the final MS Access database.  (3) Phase 3:  Conservation treatment based on Phase 2 treatment proposals.  The contractor must provide the treatment as outlined in the approved proposal for objects.  Prior to approval of any treatment, the contractor must provide a total cost (including transportation, supplies, and personnel), location of work, transportation routes, proposed schedule, and any additional information deemed appropriate for the government to judge the merits of the plan.  The contractor must furnish all materials, equipment and supplies as needed to treat the objects.  The treatment must be carried out by a conservator or a conservation technician with appropriate training and experience.  The COR must be kept informed of any new information discovered through the examination and treatment process.  The COR must be contacted and must pre-approve any substantial change in the course of treatment.  The contractor must manage all technical and administrative tasks required for the planning, initiation, execution, and completion or termination of object conservation treatment projects and furnish all materials, equipment and supplies as needed to treat the objects.  (a) The contractor must either perform in-house conservation treatment on the selected objects, or off-site at a professional conservation laboratory as appropriate and approved by the COR.  NARA reserves the right to inspect and evaluate the prospective off-site treatment facility in order to ensure compliance with all applicable contract security requirements.  (b) Security requirements include a full coverage security system monitored by an off-site private company or the local police.  NARA artifacts must be located inside a locked room or suite of rooms and must be located in a locked cabinet or otherwise secured when not being worked on.  Access and keys must be controlled.  The facility must be monitored by a fire detection system that is monitored by a private company or the local fire department.  The facility should be covered with a fire suppression system.  The facility must have a current emergency preparedness and recovery plan.  The contractor must show proof of full insurance coverage for fire, theft, flood and other hazards.  (c) The environmental conditions in the laboratory facility used for conservation treatment must be approved by NARA.  The facility must have air conditioning and the HVAC systems must be run 24x7 without setbacks.  Any sunlight must be filtered to exclude UV, and objects must be protected from light when not being worked on.  (d) The contractor must maintain regular contact with the COR, either by teleconference, on-site or off-site meetings, and email throughout the course of the treatment project for each object, in order to collaboratively manage the treatment process and  to report on the progress of the conservation treatment project.  The contractor must contact the COR upon receipt of the object to be treated at the beginning of the treatment work, and upon the completion of the treatment work.  The COR must be contacted immediately if NARA objects are threatened or damaged by an emergency situation, theft or any disaster.  The contractor must provide a report for each object that includes the reasons for treatment, the treatment procedures and methodology, and materials used in the treatment.  The contractor must provide five copies of the draft report to the COR.  The draft report must be provided before the object is returned to the Library.  No later than there weeks following the receipt of the draft report, the COR will submit NARA’s recommended changes or edits to the report.  No later than three weeks following the receipt of NARA comments, the contractor must provide five copies of the final report in MS Word.  Digital images must also be recorded for supplementary documentation of the condition and treatment of each object.  A copy of each image file, in uncompressed TIFF or JPEG format, must be provided to the COR upon completion of conservation treatment.  A photographic scale and the object identification number must be included in the image frame.  PERSONNEL:  The success of any contract is contingent upon the quality and performance of personnel.  Conservation assessment and treatment require personnel with the technical expertise and experience to address the variety of holdings of the Presidential Libraries.  (1) All contractors conducting work on this contract must be a citizen of the United States or a Resident Alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by an Alien Registration Receipt Card. Appropriate proof of citizenship or authorized resident alien status must be provided to the CO and the COR prior to the start of work by any contractor personnel, including new and replacement personnel.  (2) All key employees must fluently speak, read, and write the English language.  (3) The contractor must in all cases represent that it is an independent contractor and that its employees are neither agents, representatives and/or employees of NARA.  (4) Due to the unique nature of each collection the contractor must ensure that all personnel, both contractor and subcontractor, performing services comply with NARA requirements regarding employment suitability and access to government premises if access is for more than 15 consecutive days in non-public areas of the facility.  Subcontractor and contractor personnel performing short term services who do not have NARA clearances must be escorted by NARA staff at all times.  The COR may request the contractor to immediately remove any personnel from the work site should it be determined that individuals performing services are disqualified for either suitability or security reasons, or who are found to be unfit to perform their duties.  (5) Key Personnel.  The Government has designated certain contractor personnel performing services for the Presidential Libraries as key personnel positions.  NARA reserves the right to reject any proposed key personnel.  (a) Project Manager.  The contractor must provide a project manager as the primary contract coordinator.  The project manager must be of sufficient seniority to represent the contractor, address performance issues and address contract administration as necessary.  NARA prefers a project manager with conservation assessment or collections management experience.  (b) Conservator.  The contractor must provide a conservator(s) to undertake assessments and treatments.  The conservator must be trained and skilled in the theoretical and practical aspects of preventive conservation and conservation treatment.  Most conservators specialize in the treatment of specific groups of objects (for example, archeological objects, books, ethnographic objects, natural science specimens, fine and decorative art objects, photographic materials, paintings, paper, sculpture, textiles, or wooden artifacts).  The contractor must provide conservators who possess the appropriate experience and training for the types of objects assessed and treated.  NARA recognizes that conservators may specialize in more than one type of material.  (c) Key personnel also include any other contractor or subcontractor assisting with the conducting of condition assessments on artifacts and treatment of artifacts.  GENERAL:  (1) The contractor agrees that all treatment documentation relating to any NARA artifact remains the property of NARA and cannot be used by the contractor for any purpose without prior written authorization from NARA.  This includes all written estimates, reports and supporting documentation such as photographs and any technical evaluations.  (2) The contractor must uphold the American Institute for Conservation Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice.  AIC Professional Associate or Fellow membership is preferred. (3) NARA recognizes that subcontractors may be used to undertake conservation assessments and treatment.  All subcontractors must meet the same requirements outlined for contractors in this requirement.  The contractor must not allow any subcontractor to work with NARA holdings without first receiving COR approval. (4) Additionally, NARA requires information regarding the facility to which any objects may be transported, the means of transport, and the security of holdings off-site.  A detailed facility report may be required.  Failure to fully comply with the stated requirement may be cause for rejection of the quotation.  The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant purchase order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun 2008); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Jun 2008) - vendors shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the vendor has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

The following NARA Terms and Conditions apply to this procurement:  (1) Key Personnel.  (a)  The Contractor agrees to assign to the contract those key persons who are identified in the requirement as key personnel to fill the requirements of the contract.  Resumes must be submitted for all key personnel.  No substitution or addition of personnel will be made except in accordance with this clause.  (b)  The Contractor agrees that during the first 12 months of the contract period, no personnel substitutions will be permitted, unless such substitutions are necessitated by an individual’s sudden illness, death, or termination of employment.  In any of these events, the Contractor must promptly notify the Contracting Officer/COR and provide the information required by paragraph (d) below.  (c)  If key personnel, for whatever reason, become unavailable for work under this contract for a continuous period exceeding thirty (30) working days, or are expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in its Quotation, the Contractor must propose a substitution of such personnel, in accordance with paragraph (d) below.  (d)  All proposed key personnel substitutions must be submitted, in writing, to the Contracting Officer/COR at least fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed substitution.  Each request must provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitution, a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information required by the Contracting Officer to approve or disapprove the proposed substitution(s).  Resumes for key personnel substitutions must be submitted in Contractor format.  All proposed substitutes (no matter when they are proposed during the performance period) must have qualifications that are equal to or higher than the qualifications of the person being replaced.  (e)  In the event the Contractor designates additional key personnel as deemed appropriate for the requirement, the Contractor must submit to the Contracting Officer for approval the information required in paragraph (d) above.  (f)  The Contracting Officer will evaluate requests for substitution and addition of personnel and promptly notify the Contractor, in writing, whether a request is approved or disapproved.  (g)  If the Contracting Officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or have otherwise become unavailable to perform under the contract is not reasonably forthcoming, or that a resultant reduction of productive effort would impair the successful completion of the contract, the contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate.  Alternatively, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, if the Contracting Officer finds the Contractor to be at fault for the condition, the CO may equitably adjust (downward) the contract price to compensate the Government for any delay, loss or damage as a result of the Contractor’s action.

<DESC>National Institute on Aging (NIA), The Intramural Research Program (IRP), Clinical Research Branch, intends to award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the University of Delaware, Department of Health, Nutrition and Exercise Sciences, 303E Willard Hall, Newark, DE 19716; for a project entitled:  Coding of Nutritional Survey Data for the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) Study.  The primary concern to this study is determining to what level nutrition plays in the epidemiological make-up of a diverse population when viewed in a longitudinal manner.  Specific techniques to be used to investigate the effects of nutrition and diet on a population include nutritional monitoring and dietary recall.  The project looks to establish the planning documentation and epidemiological sample frame for conducting a longitudinal study that disentangles the confounding effects of race and socioeconomic status on long-term healthy aging.  The goal of this project will focus on creating survey-sampling methodologies and applications unique to a diverse and complex population, spanning numerous and various socio-economic patterns, with a particular focus on assessment made by a longitudinal study.  One unique study development goal to be established by this project is the development of criteria essential to assess nutritional status for segmenting a diverse population base.  Nutritional methods to be used to develop this criterion include multiple dietary recalls, blood biochemistries, functional status measures, food security measures, and anthropometrical measures.  Statutory authority:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency’s requirements, 41 U.S>C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b) (1).   The cited authority is applicable because the University of Delaware has both the expertise and facilities for performing these analyses by Dr. Kuczmarski, which is widely regarded as an expert in the fields of minority nutrition, aging nutrition, nutritional monitoring and study design.  Dr. Kuczmarski  has the facilities and resources for analyzing these data and the expertise necessary for interpreting the results.  This study will collect data from the adult community dwelling volunteers.   These data must be scored and entered using specifically designed nutritional look-up tables that are available to Dr. Kuczmarski, who will supervise the scoring and entry into computer files and will assist in subsequent analyses by NIA investigators.  The period of performance is for 12 months.   This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services in
which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13,
Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA require
the services of a contractor to provide support for Bowhead Whale Feeding
Ecology Study in the Western Beaufort Sea. The goal of this study is to
facilitate mitigation of future oil and gas development by estimating
relationships among bowhead whale prey, oceanographic conditions, and bowhead
whale feeding behavior, with emphasis on identifying predictable aspects in
those relationships. The five principal objectives of BOWFEST are to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">1. Document
patterns and variability in the timing and locations of bowhead whales feeding
in the western Beaufort Sea.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">2. Estimate
temporal and spatial patterns of habitat use by bowhead whales in the study
area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">3. Document
bowhead whale prey distributions and abundance in the immediate vicinity of
feeding bowhead whales as well as in neighboring areas without whales.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">4. Document
&ldquo;fine scale&rdquo; oceanographic and other relevant environmental conditions both
near feeding bowhead whales and in neighboring areas without whales.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">5.
Characterize oceanographic features on a &ldquo;coarse scale&rdquo; relative to the study
area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A part of the research program
includes a behavioral study of whales. Approaches to bowheads will be made when
concentrations of whales are seen exhibiting apparent feeding behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">There are three principal
objectives in support of this research:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">1. Gather distribution data on
bowhead whales in the study area via boat-based surveys before the
oceanographic and aerial surveys start on 15 August.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">2. Document bowhead whale prey
amounts and types in the stomachs of whales landed during the subsistence hunt
of bowhead whales.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;">3. Document basic behavior of
feeding whales from a boat-based platform</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Contractor will be required to coordinate communication
efforts and serve as a liaison between BOWFEST researchers and the community of
stakeholders concerning bowhead whales, and take the lead on conducting some
specific Tasks of the greater BOWFEST program as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span>Task 1- <span>Whale observations and photographs via boat </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span>Task 2-<span>Whale
tagging<em> </em></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span>Task 3- <span>Stomach prey sampling<em> </em></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span>Task 4-<span>Digestive
efficiency<em> </em></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Quarterly and annual reports will be delivered to NMML who
is coordinating the overall bowhead whale feeding study. NMML will in turn pass
on the comprehensive reports to MMS.<span>&nbsp; </span>A
final report with the findings from the 2008 studies will be completed within 6

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-26.  This solicitation is restricted to small businesses, NAICS 238910, Site preparation contractors, with a small business size standard of $14.0 million average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price requirements contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.
BACKGROUNDNorth Cascades NPS Complex is responsible for storm damage repair of roads and campgrounds. We have needs for heavy equipment to perform a variety of maintenance tasks.  This contract will establish rates and procedures for heavy equipment rental with operator to assist with NPS operations, particularly to repair flood-damaged areas and to assist in major construction projects.  During July through October, 2008, we plan major repairs to the Cascade River Road (CRR).  Often work is needed in the Colonial Creek campground area and on the Thornton Creek Road (both of which are east of Marblemount on State Route 20). This contract will run from August 2008 through June 2009.  With changing fuel prices there will be provisions made if costs rise excessively.
The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will determine whether we will rent trucks or trucks with pups at the time we call for trucking service.  We cannot determine in advance the exact number of hours of truck hauling required.  We will be hauling up to 4,000 yards of material ranging from 4" minus to Class 6 riprap for the Cascade River Road project.  The Park also has intermittent needs for crushed rock to repair and resurface gravel roads, but cannot determine in advance the exact quantity required.  Gravel pits we may want delivery from are located in Darrington, Rockport, and Mount Vernon.  All gravels will be paid for by the NPS, but the trucking will be part of this contract.  We intend to establish an "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Requirements" fixed-price contract for dump trucks with or without "pups", an excavator with thumb and operator, a bulldozer with operator, a road grader with operator, and a front end loader with operator.
Lodging and meal services are available in the area on a limited basis.  Cellular phones generally do not work and there is no public Internet access.  Information about the park can be found at www.nps.gov/noca .
SCOPE OF WORK Contractor will provide all needed equipment, labor, and transportation required to provide the service requested. All equipment to be called out and tasks to be performed shall be at the request of the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  All work shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications shown below.  For work not specifically covered in the following specifications, performance of the work required will be as directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative. The work required by this contract represents requirements in excess of the quantities that the government may itself perform.  All work will be ordered and directed by the COR and shall be accomplished within the times specified for each task. This contract will remain in effect from date of award until June 30, 2009.  Estimated total contract value is <$100,000.
EQUIPMENT RENTALThe contractor shall provide 10- or 12-cubic yard heavy-haul trucks and optional pups, in excellent condition, with fully licensed drivers.  The contractor shall be responsible for the safe and legal condition and operation of the trucks.  Hauling will take place, in part, during the summer tourist season and on State Route 20.  Truck rental time shall begin when trucks arrive at the project at the time set by the COR.  This time will usually be 7:00 or 7:30 AM.  A half-hour lunch break shall be afforded at approximately 12:00 noon, but NPS will not pay for lunch breaks or time when the truck or trailer is not able to operate legally or safely.  Materials will be loaded by contractor's or NPS employees and drivers shall deliver and dump loads as directed by the COR or project inspector.   Gravel and rock will be hauled from either the Marblemount pit or the Newhalem pit up the CRR to approximately milepost 20.  Drivers will not be required to manipulate materials after dumping them.  At different times in the contract period we will require the use of varying numbers of trucks, with and without pups.  At no time will we require more than 4 trucks (two solo and two with pups) simultaneously.  
The excavator will be operated by the contractor's employee(s) to load materials into the contractor's trucks and/or pups.  All equipment must be leak-free, and all servicing must occur off-site.  Equipment below is listed in descending order of importance to the NPS.  We prefer to award this contract to one vendor, however we reserve the right to make multiple awards to make all necessary equipment available.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 August, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about AUGUST 8, 2008. Contact Regina Gardner, regina.gardner@uscg.mil or 252-335-6766 for questions regarding this solicitation.

<p>Installation Instructions for IP500 Beam Barriers</p>
<p>DELTA MODEL IP500 (H) CRASH BEAM<br />INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />General<br />The objective of the Delta Model IP500 (H) installation is to accurately align and position the two pods relative to each other. Each pod consists of two modules: a larger module that provides most of the weight, and a smaller module that serves as an anchor for the chain crash tube. The pods should be oriented so that the hinge side is on the side of the roadway required by the installation (the larger weight pods can be towards or away from the threat vehicle). The center distance between the pods is determined by the order data. So there are no mistakes, the materials should be laid out and examined; in particular, the crash beam steel chain assembly should be measured to confirm its free length. The crash beam assembly is shipped with a heavy, special processed steel chain inside the crash beam with the latch end pin installed. The chain has yellow two-piece coupling links at both ends. With the crash beam assembly laid out on a horizontal surface, measure the distance between the outside of the latch pin and the corresponding location on the yellow coupling at the other end of the chain. This dimension less 43.5 inch [110, 5 cm] should be at least 1.0 inch [2, 5 cm] greater than the specified clear opening.</p>
<p>If on first examination the chain appears to be shorter than specified, the chain should be inspected to see that it has not been twisted or tangled within the crash beam assembly. A twisted chain that appears to be short can most often be corrected by turning the free end of the chain while still in the crash beam assembly. If this doesn't work the chain should be removed from the crash beam assembly and checked while laying straight, flat and untwisted on a horizontal surface.</p>
<p>After the pods are set in place and the concrete is allowed to harden, the Beam Barrier itself is assembled on the posts.</p>
<p>Referenced Dimensions<br />The distance from the inside of one pod to the inside of the other is defined as the clear opening length, and the barricade is purchased on that basis. The clear opening is the largest width that can pass between the pods without touching them. The clear opening is typically about 12 inches [30, 5 cm] greater than the width of the roadway. The center to center distance of the support post centers is 36.69 inches [93, 2 cm] longer than the clear opening. For example, if a 144 inch [3, 66 m] Barrier was purchased, the center to center distance of the support posts will be 180.69 inches [4, 59 m].</p>
<p>The center of the beam's height above the roadway is 33.25 inches [84, 46 cm] though the weight of the beam and the chain will cause it to sag somewhat. This standard height will effectively block the main body of most of the vehicle classes which may constitute a typical security threat.</p>
<p>Application Notes<br />When designing an IP500 (H) or its variations into a roadway site, it is helpful to consider the following points:<br />1) The gate is purchased on the basis of the clear opening, which is defined as the inside dimension measured between the pods.<br />2) Make sure that there are no obstructions that will interfere with the path of the Crash Beam's swing; for example, power lines, trees, overhanging buildings, etc. Additionally, the ground underneath the pods must be flat, level, and stable.<br />3) Delta Scientific Corporation suggests that a layout be done of the actual site to examine the fit of the Barrier. The thought put into the layout can mean the difference between a successful installation and a poorly performing Barrier.</p>
<p>Delta Scientific Corporation welcomes your questions in regard to application of our products and we will be pleased to review any site drawings or make recommendations on the appropriate length and position of the Crash Beam Barrier.</p>
<p>Site Preparation and Pour</p>
<p>1) The first step of the IP500 installation is to fill the pods with concrete and allow it to harden. The pour can be done directly at the site of the installation or the pods can be filled remotely, allowed to harden, and then brought to the job site. If the pour is done at the job site, skip to steps 2, 3 and 4 below to position the pods before pouring. Before pouring concrete make sure that there are conduits in place for all hydraulic and electrical lines needed to operate the barricade and any optional equipment. The pods have no bottom, so they must be placed on a flat, smooth, and hard surface before the pour is attempted. Flat concrete or smooth asphalt is acceptable. Otherwise, the bottom of the pods will not be flat, or the wet concrete may squeeze out the bottom. Place a plastic tarp under the pods or coat the ground with a concrete releasing agent before pouring concrete. This will prevent the pods from bonding with the surface they are poured on.</p>
<p>2) Outline with a chalk line the location of the pods. Make sure the clear opening distance is correct. Also confirm that chalk outlines are aligned correctly. The distance between the pods and the alignment can be adjusted somewhat but be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>3) Each module slots 3" x 8" [7, 62 cm x 20,32cm] slots which are designed to make the modules easy to move with a forklift. The anchor modules must be held from the side by a forklift and the weight modules must be held from the end. If the modules are set in place at the job site before the concrete is poured, it is better to use a concrete releasing agent instead of a plastic tarp to prevent bonding to the ground. If a tarp is used, it will cover the chalk lines, but the chalk should still be visible under a releasing agent. The anchor modules must be set in place first. Place the anchor modules in the chalk outlines made in step 2 above. The stop signs should be facing the protected side of the barricade. The hole in the hinge post ears should be offset away from the road. The claw shape of the latch post should be pointing away from the road. Once the anchor modules are in place, measure the clear opening to make sure it is correct. Also confirm that the modules are aligned with respect to each other.</p>
<p>4) After the anchor modules are set in place, the weight modules can be positioned. First, take the removable covers off the top of the weight modules. Near the end opposite the stop sign find the steel tubes. These tubes hold the drop pins that interlock the modules. Make sure the tubes are empty before moving the weight modules into place. Use a forklift to hold the module at the end with the stop sign. Line up the slots on the other end of the module with the interlock tabs of the anchor module. Gently move the weight module up against the anchor module, making sure that the interlock tabs go into the slots of the weight module. It is important to do this carefully to prevent moving the anchor module when positioning the weight module.</p>
<p>5) Remeasure the clear opening and check the alignment. If they are both still correct, place the drop pins in the tubes. The drop pins must reach the bottom of the tubes (the metal rings at the top of the pins should be just below the top of the tubes).</p>
<p>6) If pouring concrete at the job site, pour it and allow it to harden in the modules.</p>
<p>7) Replace the covers to each module.</p>
<p>8) Excavate and prepare suitable forms for the foundation base of the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>9) Trench for the hydraulic lines and any electrical conduits from the hydraulic power unit to the end support post assembly(s). Install the PVC ducting for the hydraulic hoses and all required electrical conduit from customer's control point(s) and the power disconnect to the Barrier.</p>
<p>10) Concrete notes and specifications (minimum requirements):</p>
<p>A) Contractor shall verify and be responsible for all dimensions and conditions at the job site.</p>
<p>B) Concrete shall be laboratory designed, machine mixed, producing 3,000 psi (20, 68 MPa) at 28 days.</p>
<p>C) Cement shall be tested Portland cement conforming to ASTM C150, Type I or II.</p>
<p>D) Aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Maximum size of aggregate shall be 1.5 inch (38 MM).</p>
<p>E) Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to final deposit by methods that will prevent separation or loss of materials. Troughs, buckets or the like may be used to convey concrete. In no case shall concrete be allowed to free drop more than 5 feet (1, 5 M). F) Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated by suitable means during placement and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into corners of forms.</p>
<p>G) Concrete shall be maintained above 50&ordm;F [10&ordm;C] and in a moist condition for at least 7 days after placement. Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating concrete materials and protecting concrete during freezing or near freezing weather.</p>

<p>Crash Beam Assembly</p>
<p><br />Component List</p>
<p>Hinge End Module Assembly w/Hinge End Top Plate and Hydraulic Cylinder<br />Latch End Module Assembly<br />Two Weight Modules<br />Drop Pins to Connect Modules<br />Yoke Assembly w/Bearing (Pillow) Blocks<br />Crash Tube Clamp<br />Barrier Crash Tube with PVC liner w/Crash Beam Chain Assembly<br />Limit Switch (es) (optional)<br />Hydraulic Power Unit<br />Hydraulic Interconnect Hoses<br />Hydraulic Fittings (as required)<br />Miscellaneous Mounting Hardware<br />Miscellaneous Purchased Options</p>
<p>The assembly can be done most conveniently by two persons and a small fork lift or other lifting device.</p>
<p>Note: If mechanized lifting equipment is not available, adequate personnel for handling are necessary as the crash beam assembly weighs up to 350 pounds [160 kg] (depending on length).</p>
<p>Assembly Sequence</p>
<p>1) Allow the concrete to harden as specified.</p>
<p>2) If necessary, mount the hinged end top plate on the hinged end post assembly using the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers (leave loose).</p>
<p>3) Remove the hinge module hydraulic cylinder access cover and set aside.</p>
<p>4) If necessary, mount the lower end of the hydraulic cylinder using the clevis attachment point in the cylinder cabinet. Lock the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>5) If necessary, set bearing blocks on the yoke pivot shafts.</p>
<p>6) Set the yoke assembly (with bearing blocks attached) on the hinged end top plate. Loosely fasten the bearing block bolts (1/2"-13 x 1.5" long).</p>
<p>7) Remove the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers from the hinge end top plate and install the yoke safety retainer brackets. Re-install the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers (leave loose).</p>
<p>8) Place the tube locking collar around the crash beam with the positioning tab facing the<br />hinge end. Do not tighten the collar bolts until the tube is positioned in the yoke.</p>
<p>9) Lift the crash beam tube assembly containing the chain and latch pin and slide it into the yoke. It is necessary to start the loose end of the chain into the yoke.</p>
<p>10) If the hinge pin is not already installed, it should be installed now. Loosen one of the yoke bearing blocks and raise one side of the yoke to have clearance while installing the<br />hardened anchor pin. Insert the hardened 2 inch [5, 08 cm] diameter pin through the two<br />anchor ears and secure in place with roll pins. Lower the yoke and tighten the bearing block bolts. Connect the last link of the chain to the hinge pin with the second yellow two piece coupling. Unscrew the set screw in the collar at the center of the coupling and<br />remove the shaft. Place half the coupling around the hinge pin and the other half around<br />the last link of the chain. Reinsert the shaft through both halves of the coupling and the<br />collar. Tighten the set screw in the collar.</p>
<p>11) Check the position of the center of the bearing blocks relative to the center of the hinge pin. The hinge pin should be about 5/8 inch [1, 59 cm] further back (away from the road) than the bearing block center. The bearing blocks have slots that allow for some<br />adjustment. If necessary, loosen the bearing block bolts, move the bearing block, and<br />retighten the bolts.</p>
<p>12) With the crash beam in the horizontal position push the chain into the tube at the yoke end, so that a minimum of chain is exposed. Next insert the 3/4 inch [1, 9 cm] round cross pin through the hangers on the yoke and through the closest chain link. Tighten the set screws in the hanger. This is to minimize the amount of free chain exposed beyond the end of the tube.</p>
<p>13) Attach the upper end of the hydraulic cylinder to the mounting clevis on the bottom side of the yoke. Secure the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>14) With the Crash Beam in the full down position, check the side clearance between the<br />latching pin mounting box and the latching end posts. The box should be centered.<br />Note: If the box is not centered, with the four nuts securing the hinged end top plate<br />loose, swing the beam until it is centered on the latching post - then tighten the four<br />nuts.</p>
<p>15) With the crash beam in the full down position, check the clearance between the hardened latching pin and the latch posts. The clearance should be approximately 1/2 inch [12 mm]. This should be confirmed by raising and lowering the Crash Beam and insuring there is no interference in any direction.<br />If there is interference, the crash tube can be moved in or out or turned as required. Once the proper clearance is established the locking collar on the tube can be nested into the notch in the yoke and firmly tightened.</p>
<p>16) Grease the bearing blocks, actuator clevises and the chain at the points where the chain exits the crash beam. Use Shell Oil Company "Dolium R", Chevron "SRI No. 2" or Texaco Inc. "Premium RB" or similar.</p>
<p>17) Set the hydraulic power unit on the foundation, locate and drill for the anchor bolts. Caulk the base of the power unit enclosure to the foundation using a suitable RTV compound. Tighten foundation bolts.</p>
<p>18) Pull the hydraulic hoses from the hydraulic power unit to the hydraulic cylinder on the hinge post.</p>
<p>19) Pull any wires from the hydraulic power unit to the end support posts as required. Pull power and control wires to the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>20) Replace the hinge end support hydraulic cylinder access cover.</p>
<p>21) Touch up paint if required. Stripe the beam with the reflective tape if desired. Apply a thin film of anti-seize lubricant (compound) to any non painted or non plated carbon steel<br />surfaces (such as bearing blocks and exposed threads of fasteners).</p>
<p>Operation Notes</p>
<p>1) This barrier system is equipped with a descent control valve which is located on the lower fitting of the hydraulic cylinder. It will prevent the rapid descent of the crash beam in the event the hydraulic pressure line is ruptured or sabotaged. It has been factory set and sealed and should not be tampered with, nor should anyone attempt to adjust it. In the event of a problem contact the factory immediately for a calibrated replacement.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. NSR-08-508 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-14.  This is not a small business set aside.  This RFP is for full and open competition.  

----------------------------------------
BACKGROUND
In April 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revised 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations.  The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants, consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.  Concomitant with this action, the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also offered to provide a supply to the local governments.  In addition to providing the initial supply of KI, NRC agreed in September 2006 to provide replenishment of the potassium iodide for those States currently providing it for populations within the 10-mile (EPZs) of commercial nuclear power plants.

---------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE 
The Contractor shall provide shipments of 65 mg KI tablets produced by an FDA-approved manufacturer, in the quantities and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO).

---------------------------------------
SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall supply and distribute Potassium Iodide (KI) tablets as ordered by the NRC.

--------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS
Each 65 mg KI tablet shall be manufactured by an FDA-approved manufacturer and must be an FDA approved product.  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least two pieces.  Each 65 mg KI tablet shall have the maximum FDA-approved shelf life from date of acceptance by the NRC or the State or Tribe to which delivery was made.  Each tablet shall be individually packaged.

--------------------------------------------
TASK 1 
SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS 
The contractor shall provide NRC orders of 65 mg KI tablets, as ordered by NRC.  The estimated amount that will be required for this contract is 2,500,000 tablets.  This figure is provided as an estimate only.  The NRC is not obligated to order the estimated number as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.  

-----------------------------------------------
TASK 2 
DISTRIBUTION 
The contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the email at the time the order is placed.

A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides ease of distribution, packaging, and storage; and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets, once provided to the State or Tribe.  As a matter of redistribution and tamper avoidance, individually packaged or blister packaged tablets are the preferred method in packaging the tablets.  The NRC estimates that three deliveries will be required to three different states.  However, the NRC is not obligated to order any estimated number of distributions as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.      

 ---------------------------------- 
DAMAGED/CRUSHED TABLETS 
The Contractor shall replace, at no cost to the NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping.  The NRC will provide claims for replacement no later than 45 calendar days after delivery.

----------------------------------------
BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS 
The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.

CONTRACTOR POINT OF CONTACT 
The contractor shall designate one primary and one alternate personnel as point of contact.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 10 August 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 06 August 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6713. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Introduction<BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The Project Director, Installation Management Systems  Army/Military Entrance Processing Command (PD IMS-A/MEPCOM) is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Information Technology (IT), tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and /or operational capabilities described in this RFI.  The PD IMS-A/MEPCOM will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential IT solutions.  The proposed NAICS Code for this work is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.<BR>This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government on its eventual acquisition approach.  All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and Market Research purposes only.  The PD IMS-A/MEPCOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the PD IMS-A/MEPCOM evaluation of the information received.  <BR>Overview<BR>The US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) is responsible for determining the physical, mental, and moral qualifications of candidates for enlistment into the Armed Forces of the United States.  As such, USMEPCOM is an integral and essential part of the military recruiting and personnel systems of the Military Services, because the command serves as an entry point for much of the information that supports recruiting, training, and management of the nations war fighting resources.  The USMEPCOM, through the PD IMS-A/MEPCOM, is currently engaged in efforts to transform its business processes and operational environment through the creation of the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).  The capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel information across the Command and the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) is critical to fulfilling the USMEPCOM mission.  VIPS will modernize and enhance the IT capabilities of USMEPCOM through the collection, evaluation, validation, and exchanges of enlistee qualification information during peacetime and mobilization.  <BR>Technical Objectives<BR>The VIPS system will be based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that will enable the electronic capture of required applicant qualification data; make accession data fully, appropriately, and securely available to applicants and accession partners (i.e., Recruiting and Training Commands); enable full compliance with the Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a paperless, net-centric environment, electronically providing data to official DoD health [Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)] and human resources [Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS)]; and take advantage of automated data capture technology (i.e., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results).  When VIPS is implemented, USMEPCOM's role in the ACOI will change from carrying out the execution of qualifying processes and activities to verifying qualification information and serving as an information broker and provider to ACOI partners and secondary stakeholders.  <BR>The USMEPCOM of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free and highly automated.  In this environment VIPS data will be readily available and easily shared with ACOI and stakeholder organizations, dramatically improving the effectiveness and efficiency of manning the Armed Forces.<BR>Corporate Capabilities<BR>A clear comprehension of corporate capabilities is needed.  Please provide a company profile which includes the company DUNS number, past and current clients, and available facilities (i.e., lab).  <BR>Industry/System Capabilities<BR>Information is sought regarding design and integration of an interoperable paper-less accessioning system that will be adopted as the information broker for candidate qualification into the military service.  Please provide a model/framework for system design using the following technology capabilities which meet DoD Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid (GIG), Modular Open System Approach (MOSA), Interoperability, and Information Assurance (IA) Standards/Tenets:<BR>"	Portal Services<BR>"	Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES)<BR>"	Service Oriented Architecture<BR>o	Records Management<BR>o	Medical Assessment<BR>o	Security Assessment<BR>"	Data Security with emphasis on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) security<BR>"	Secure Accessibility (VPN, PKI, Biometrics) <BR>"	Business Intelligence<BR>"	Network/System Operations and Management<BR>"	Video Teleconferencing (VTC)<BR>"	Wireless Technology & Security<BR>"	Workflow Management<BR>Please illustrate the following:<BR><BR>"	Explanation of the proposed framework to fully explore your approach.<BR>"	How the framework will integrate these functionalities and theorize system description.<BR>"	How the framework is relevant or how the proposed functionalities are integrated.<BR>"	Current capabilities and examples in the creation of a SOA NCES integrated framework in the DoD/Federal environment.<BR>"	How you would apply Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) or another process improvement model/framework to your approach.  Include your CMMI level if applicable.  <BR>"	Information/overview on your proposed Contingency Operation Plan/Disaster Recovery (COOP/DR) services.<BR>"	An overview of your proposed management approach.<BR>"	Gross/order-of-magnitude estimated cost of the proposed system.<BR>Instructions<BR>All responses, comments and questions must be submitted electronically to Graham.Evans@us.army.mil.  No telephonic discussions will be held. Please limit your response to no more than 20 pages.   Responses are due in PowerPoint and/or MS Word format by 4:00 PM EDT on Thursday, August 14, 2008.  Responses, comments, and questions will not be accepted after this time.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Question # 1<BR>Subject:  RFP No.  W91QUZ-08-R-0032<BR>Reference: RFP Section L.2.2.3, subparagraph (3), Page 80. <BR>Government Text: Offerors shall provide the above required information for any proposed subcontractor who will perform a portion of the effort.<BR>Reference: RFP Section M.4.3, Paragraph 2, Page 90.<BR>Government Text:  The Government will conduct evaluations based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offerors past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors&.<BR><BR>Question:  Many offerors will have teams with several tens of subcontractors, especially small businesses, which would result in both a major effort for offerors to submit and the Government to evaluate.  Such a large effort and package would almost certainly be inconsistent with the time allowed and page limits for the Past Performance submission.   <BR><BR>Is it the government's intent to collect past performance data via contractor submission and customer questionnaires on all or only major subcontractors?  <BR>As an example, major subcontractors could be defined as those which may perform over 20% of contract labor or those deemed critical to contract performance by the offeror.<BR><BR>Response #1<BR>Please refer to changes in Section L.2.2.3 of Amendment A0001 of the RFP. <BR><BR>Question # 2   <BR>Subject:  RFP No. W91QUZ-08-R-0032<BR>Reference:  General  Number of Planned Awards<BR>The Government has not provided any indication regarding the anticipated number of planned awards for BOSS-U.  This information is important to guide industry decisions on bidding and teaming.  Request the Government indicate the planned number of awards for BOSS-U.<BR><BR>Response #2<BR>This number of awardees will be determined after receiving proposals and conducting evaluations.  The number of awardees will depend on the number of proposals and the results of the evaluations.<BR><BR>Question # 3   <BR>Subject:  RFP No. W91QUZ-08-R-0032<BR>Reference:  RFP Section L.2.2.3, pages 79-80<BR>The proposal instructions for Past Performance require the offeror to provide references and descriptions for ALL relevant Government contracts (prime and sub), and for any proposed subcontractors who will perform a portion of the effort.  We have hundreds of contracts relevant to the BOSS-U PWS, not counting the relevant contracts of our team members.  This instruction is inconsistent with the 15 page limit for this section, and is also inconsistent with recent ITEC-4 past performance instructions on similar IDIQ contracts.  Request the Government specify a limited number of past performance references be provided, consistent with the page limit for this section.  Also, request that the 7 calendar day deadline for submitting the list of references be extended to allow offerors to select their best references after this question has been answered.<BR><BR>Response #3<BR>Please refer to changes in Section L.2.2.3 of Amendment A0001 of the RFP. <BR>The 7 calendar day deadline for submitting the list of past performance references has been extended to 14 days.<BR><BR>Question # 4   <BR>Subject:  RFP No.  W91QUZ-08-R-0032<BR>Reference: RFP Section  L__, Paragraph(s) L.2.2.3 (3), Page(s) _80___ and<BR>Reference: RFP Section  M__, Paragraph(s) M.4.3___, Page(s) _90___,<BR>The Section L reference requires that offerors submit past performance questionnaires for any subcontractor who will perform a portion of the effort. There are issues raised as a result of this requirement:<BR>(1)   Since this is an IDIQ contract with no defined work and teaming<BR>partners can be added after award, it is not possible to determine which subcontractors may perform a portion of the effort. Team members are chosen for their ability to provide products and services that add value to the offer; therefore, it is likely that every team member will perform some portion of the effort requiring at least one and possibly several contract citations (Offerors shall submit a description of all Government<BR>contracts&) for every subcontractor on the team. Given the volume of information required for each citation, large teams with multiple subcontractors will not be able to meet this requirement within the 15-page limit.<BR>(2)   The requirement to submit the questionnaires within 7 days of RFP<BR>release leaves insufficient time to identify and evaluate candidate contracts for relevance and prepare customer points of contact to ensure their cooperation in completing and submitting the questionnaires.<BR>(3)   The Section M reference twice refers to the past performance of<BR>major subcontractors, which reflects the language used in the draft RFP Section L requiring past performance for subcontractors performing a significant portion of the effort.<BR><BR>Will the Government revise the requirement to read, any subcontractor who will perform a significant portion of the effort, which is the language used in the draft RFP? Or will the government  remove the requirement to submit subcontractor past performance.  <BR><BR>In order to complete the Date E-Mailed to POC RFP requirement in paragraph L.2.2.3, offerors must task customer POCs with completing the questionnaire prior to submitting the POC list and meet the 7-day deadline (Friday 25 July). To avoid asking our customers to meet a requirement that may change, we request the Government respond as soon as possible before the deadline. If the language will not be changed, will the Government:  <BR><BR>Allow additional time to submit the POC list?<BR>Increase or eliminate the page limit?<BR>Clarify the reference to major subcontractors in Section M?<BR><BR>Response # 4<BR>Please refer to changes in Section L.2.2.3 of Amendment A0001 of the RFP. <BR>The 7 calendar day deadline for submitting the list of past performance references has been extended to 14 days.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>

In M.4.3 on page 68 (as referenced above), the RFP states: The Government will conduct evaluations based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offerors past performance, as well as that of its major [emphasis added] subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.  Thus, this leads us to believe the intent is for past performance to be included from the prime and major subcontractors only.  Please note that since there is no limit on the number of contracts that are to be submitted for past performance (other than they most be recent and relevant), by not limiting the subcontractor contracts to major subcontractors only, the Government could be looking at receiving a substantially large number of references for each proposal submission.<BR><BR>(1) Is our assumption that the Government requires past performance information from major subcontractors correct?  If so, please add the word major following the word any in L.2.2.3 (3) on page 62 (as referenced above). <BR><BR>(2) As per the requirement in L.2.2.3 (5) on page 62 (as referenced above), it asks that the offeror provides a list of POCs for all referenced contracts within 7 days of the release of the RFP.  Can the Government please provide clarification on this question as soon as possible?<BR><BR>Response # 1<BR>Please refer to changes in Section L.2.2.3 of Amendment A0001 of the RFP. <BR>The 7 calendar day deadline for submitting the list of past performance references has been extended to 14 days.<BR><BR>Question # 2<BR>Subject:  RFP No. W91QUZ-08-R-0033<BR>Reference 1: RFP Section  L.1 Proposal Submission, 3) Proposal Preparation & Organization, d) Proposal Content, Paragraph(s)  N/A, in table, Page(s)  59.<BR>Reference 2: RFP Section  L.2.2.3 Part 3  Past Performance, Paragraph(s)  #1 (of Section L.2.2.3, Page(s)  61.  <BR><BR>Question/Comment:  In L.1, 3, d on page 59, Volume 2 - Part 3 (Past Performance) is limited to 10 pages.  However in L.2.2.3 on page 61, the RFP states: Offerors shall submit a description of all Government contracts (prime contracts and major subcontracts) performed during the past three (3) years that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  This means that offerors are required to submit detailed past performance information for all recent and relevant contracts for both themselves and their subcontractors.  Given the amount of information required, the 10-page page limit is highly restrictive.  This offeror recommends that only up to ten recent and relevant contracts be submitted in the 10-page Volume 2  Part 3 (Past Performance) section.<BR><BR>Response # 2<BR>Please refer to changes in Section L.2.2.3 of Amendment A0001 of the RFP. <BR><BR>Question # 3<BR>Subject:  RFP No. W91QUZ-08-R-0033<BR>Reference 1: RFP Section  Section A  Standard Form 33, Paragraph(s) N/A, Page(s)  N/A.<BR>Reference 2: RFP Section  Section K  Representations and Certifications, Paragraph(s)  N/A, Page(s)  55 and 56. <BR><BR>Question/Comment: Section A requires Standard Form 33 and Section K requires Representations and Certification information.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contemplates awarding, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the storage and rotation of pediatric vaccines to be used as a national stockpile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the Government's best interest due to the fact that Glaxo Smith Klein is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that they manufacture. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contemplates awarding, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the storage and rotation of pediatric vaccines to be used as a national stockpile. CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Wyeth is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that they manufacture. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified&nbsp;business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Additional quantities of vaccines acquired under preceding or succeeding separate supply contracts or delivery orders may be added to the stockpile by modification to this contract. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Gary Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued, approximately within 15 days. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted.

<DESC>Amendment 4 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE)

The purpose of Amendment 4 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) is to make the following changes:

1. Page 4, Part One, Overview information, change the PROPOSAL DUE DATE from 28 July 2008 to 26 August 2008.

2. Pages 15, replace section 1.1.8 entitled  Oral Presentation and Demonstration Expectations, in its entirety with the following: 

The proposer is requested to plan for an oral presentation in Washington, DC, which will include a discussion of all testing and experimental results showing technical maturity of their proposed hardware, based on the TRL guidance in Appendix A, in support of the technical and cost proposal evaluation.  This event will occur not later than 30 days following proposal submission, or a time negotiated between DARPA and the proposer.  The oral presentation is limited to 4 (four) hours total. 

The oral presentations should address at a minimum, discussions of TRL assessments, supportive documentation, and determination of the proposed components. Test data for TRL 6 components/subsystems should be documented in sufficient detail and in a form that the review team can assess the testing methods, statistical significance of the tests, and results for each component/subsystem proposed for the MAINGATE node.  This information should follow the guidance given in Appendix A.  This oral presentation time is not for discussion or clarification of the full proposal.  However, the government may ask questions on proposals to help clarify any issues brought up during initial proposal review.
 
The oral presentations should show that the proposer has met the basic program entry criteria to prove the proposed equipment, algorithm, network, etc. are mature enough to enter this program.  The oral presentation also shall address an initial projection of the unit production cost estimate and discuss the path ahead for achieving the projected unit cost. See Appendix A for the appropriate TRL level description.

3.  Page 25, Section 4.4.1, change the proposal due date from 28 July 2008 to 26 August 2008.
