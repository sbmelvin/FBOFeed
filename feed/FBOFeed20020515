The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division is seeking innovative solutions for the development of automated tools to exploit MTI data and incorporate information fusion from current and future sensor systems.  This will offer the warfighter an enhanced operational capability to automatically exploit MTI data in order to locate, identify, and track high value ground moving targets.  Current MTI exploitation techniques are manual, operator intensive, and very limited.  This effort will also provide algorithms to enable the optimal fusion of resources for the timely detection, track, and identification of ground moving targets.  There are currently more targets than resources in any concept of operation so that adequate optimization of resources is critical to being able to engage moving vehicles. This MTI exploitation BAA will focus on the following technology areas: ground moving target tracking, motion pattern analysis, behavioral pattern analysis, geo-registration, feature aided tracking, multiple platform tracking, and resource allocation and scheduling.  In the area of ground moving target tracking, innovative algorithms are sought to allow current surveillance platforms to automatically track targets in a variety of background environments.  Motion pattern analysis tools may also be developed to analyze MTI tracks and identify entities or groups of entities that may be of military significance.  Examples of this include the detection of convoys and formations, determination of sources and sinks via traffic flow analysis, and determination of lines of communication.  Behavioral pattern analysis tools are needed to determine the intent of entities or groups of entities based on terrain, doctrine, and historical data.  An example would be the determination of a probable hide site for a missile launcher based on measurements indicating the launch site. Geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing tacking errors from different sensors, specifically registering RF tags and images from multiple platforms.  Feature aided tracking may be developed to track targets based on certain features, some of which include velocity, vehicle type (track vs. wheels), HRR, and ISAR. Multiple platform tracking will improve target recognition and location by utilizing MTI data gathered from various sensors. The combination of these technologies will provide a powerful tool set for operators to exploit MTI data and will enable the creation of a more comprehensive picture of the battlespace.  Finally, in the area of resource allocation the focus will be that of moving target indication and the scheduling required to detect, track, and exploit moving targets whether the target be airborne or ground based.  The scheduling algorithms will be capable of being integrated into the Air Forces Time Critical Targeting Cell for the real time allocation of resources to assist in the detection, track, and identification of time sensitive targets.  The scheduling algorithms may also be integrated with the targeting assignment toolbox, namely the Joint Targeting Toolbox.  Information fusion will require the gathering and processing of information from various sensors, platforms, and multiple systems to include MTI fusion with HRR reports, imagery, and SIGINT.  Advanced concepts for information fusion technology, which includes multilevel sensor/platform/system resource management, central/distributed fusion management, and database information management, also need to be developed to achieve this goal. Multilevel sensor/platform/system resource management is needed to provide a seamless environment for the user.  This involves global resource management where platform cueing and fusion of various sensors, platforms, and/or integration of multiple systems will provide extensive data.  Central/distributed fusion management may include optimizing data distinctiveness, defining mechanisms for information push/pull, and defining levels of responsibility.  Database information management needs to be enhanced by concepts of robustness such as model-based reasoning, context sensitivity and efficiency.  The database support to the algorithms needs to be upgraded by concepts such as client/server relationships that take advantage of object oriented software.  New parallel techniques must be explored to allow implementation of algorithms for real time use.  This effort seeks to leverage existing technologies such as the Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) Multi-Platform fusion algorithms and develop a resource scheduling algorithm analyzing terrain blockage, cross cueing capabilities, revisit rates, and detection accuracy.   The Air Force currently can schedule sensor resources such as Joint STARS and Global Hawk in real time using dedicated communication links between the ground stations and the platforms.  Currently no cross cueing is being performed optimizing coverage and the information flow between platforms.  The same goes for space assets as well, where timeliness of the data is more of an issue because of the collection times associated with space assets.  However, space assets provide a new foundation in that they provide consistent coverage of hostile target areas over a continuous 24 hour cycle.  This provides for normalization to be developed over the movement patterns associated with normal operations.  The effort will leverage existing developments in the operational area such as the Time Critical Targeting Aid and Moving Target Indicator Exploitation (MTIX) and develop on these architectures making it easily adaptable to existing architectures for technology transition. From all aspects of information fusion technology, measures of performance and measures of effectiveness need to be developed and integrated into these new concepts.  This will provide methods for consistent world views.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerers are required to submit an original and three (3) copies of a ten (10) page or less white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution. Small business offerors must also send one (1) copy of the cover letter only, by First Class mail (DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED), to AFRL/IFB, ATTN:  Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, 26 Electronic Parkway; Rome NY 13441-4514.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEA, ATTN:  Rick Gassner, Reference BAA 00-01-IFKPA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4114. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  White papers are due for FY00 not later than 15 December 1999. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY01-30Jul00; FY02-30Jul01; FY03-30Jul02; FY04-30Jul03.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, and c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.   In addition, the Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort.  The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principle funding of this BAA and anticipated awards will start approximately FY00.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100K to $1.5M.  Total funding for this BAA is $24.0M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Foreign-owned offerors are advised that they are excluded from participating at the prime contract level.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerers should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, for information if they contemplate responding.   Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contract Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in AFR 31.205-18. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at a time of award.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-00-06-IFKPA
<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>Points of Contact:  Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, (315) 330-2308, email: Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil; Mr. Daniel F. Fayette, Program Manager, (315) 330-2151, email: fayetted@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is soliciting proposals for new concepts, tactics and tools to support effects-based operations.  The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration to support an Effects-Based Operations (EBO) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The specific goals are to:  a) develop an operationally oriented framework for EBO which includes EBO term definitions, indicators of effects, differences and similarities between EBO approaches and others, and application examples of EBO, b) provide tools and techniques to support the warfighter in planning, executing and assessing effects-based campaigns, c) integrate the effects-based tools and techniques into an EBO dynamic tasking toolkit and d) assess the effectiveness of the toolkit through a series of measured experiments and exercises.  The scope of this ATD covers a broad range of technology disciplines, including but not limited to collaborative planning & assessment, modeling & simulation, knowledge-based representation and problem solving, targeting, and infrastructure support which includes agent, database, middleware and visualization technologies.  Specific capabilities of interest to the EBO ATD include: a) efficiently determining effects-based campaign strategy, b) improved planning leading to more accurate specification of logistics requirements both physically and temporally, c) developing synchronized campaign and combat assessment requests for information (RFIs), d) enabling "what if" analysis of strategy/task options to optimize use of joint assets, e) integrating lethal/non-lethal Information Operations (IO) methods in a common framework, f) focusing/leveraging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets in campaign assessment (e.g. are we accomplishing objectives), g) supporting rapid development of high quality target sets, h) developing indicators of battle damage, i) supporting re-targeting in light of battle damage, j) providing automation support for building both strategy and assessment plans, k) supporting generation of tasks to drive the Master Air Attack Plan (MAAT)/Air Tasking Order (ATO) process, l) providing a continuous monitoring capability with links to operational databases, m) providing a drill-down feature that allows rapid response to General Officer/decision maker questions, n) providing critical information for development of support plans, o) supporting the rapid  collection/display of accurate, relevant information for decision making, p) integrating analysis tools into C2 systems and the decision making process, q) enabling predictive C2, r) providing realistic "train as you fight" environment.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable software solutions to meet the need of the EBO ATD.  Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches.  Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software prototypes and demonstrations.  Additional information concerning this Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program, including a Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) for Effects- Based Operations, can be found at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html.  It is intended that multiple awards be made under this PRDA. The subject PRDA is soliciting two types of proposals:  Type 1 - Technology Proposals and Type 2 - Integration & Assessment Proposals.  Type 1 proposals are to address the EBO operational framework and/or technology in support of EBO (items a and b stated as specific goals above). Type 2 proposals are to address:  a) the development of a technical architecture framework for tool integration, b)the integration of the EBO technology tools, c) the development of EBO experiments/exercises and d) the measurement of the EBO toolkit in the context of the experiments/exercises.   Offerors submitting Type 2 proposals are prohibited from submitting Type 1 proposals.  Offerors may submit multiple Type 1 proposals.  Only one Type 2 award will be made under this PRDA.  Principal funding of the PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY01.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $250K to $3.5M.  Total funding for the PRDA is $20M.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  An informational brief will be held at Air Force Research Laboratory on 11 Jul 00 in the auditorium of Building 106, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY at 9:00 AM.  Please notify Ms Carla Burns if you will be attending at (315) 330-2638 or email: burnsc@rl.af.mil.  Offerors are required to submit (5) copies of a 15 page (or less) white paper with a cover letter.  Small Business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN:  Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title.  Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, White paper Type; Section B:  Effort objective; and Section C: Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Daniel F. Fayette, Reference PRDA-00-06-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  Evaluation of the Type 1 proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including familiarity with effects-based operations, how the proposed technology addresses the needs of the EBO CONOPS, the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Evaluation of the Type 2 proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall technical and management plan for a) developing a technical architecture framework for tool integration, b) integrating the EBO technology tools, c) developing EBO experiments/exercises, and d)  assessing the EBO toolkit in the context of the experiments/exercises, 2) Offeror's demonstrated capability to successfully integrate various technologies (i.e. adaptation, scale-up) and successfully conduct experiments (i.e. evaluation and technology demonstration),  3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is excluded at the prime contract level.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at 1-800-352-3572.  The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award.  The cutoff date for submission of white papers is 3 Aug 00 for FY01, 20 Aug 01 for FY02, 20 Aug 02 for FY03 and 20 Aug 03 for FY04. This PRDA is open and effective until cancelled.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors for this announcement.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308.

<DESC>s virtual memory systems inhibit the performance of many applications by running them in a data-starved mode.  That is, these applications are not constrained by the processing speed or memory, but rather the inability of the memory system to deliver the requested data in a timely manner.  This research seeks to leverage and transition the revolutionary results from DoD sponsored investigations including DARPA's Embedded Computing, Adaptive Computing, Data Intensive Systems, Applied Computational Mathematics, and Low Power Computing Programs, the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program (HPCMP), and the BMDO Discriminating Interceptor Technology Program (DITP).  By leveraging research from the aforementioned programs, newly developed memory architectures that manage the placement and flow of data, as well as manipulate data in the memory subsystem itself may provide the basis for information fusion architectures capable of real-time ID/Position estimation, situation assessment and threat assessment.  Two areas of specific interest are (1) development of the hardware requirement tradespace identifying existing bottlenecks in fusion processing and the relevant new architectures that would affordably enable/enhance fusion capability, and (2) design and development of such architectures for DoD fielded systems.  Technical solutions and/or approaches should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches to address fusion processing deficiencies within current and planned Air Force systems.  Deliverables will be technical reports, published papers, presentations at conferences, and when appropriate: feasibility models, prototypes, and/or demonstrations.  Such applications may include, but are not limited to, Information Fusion, Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing and Knowledge Bases.  Other than the intent to focus the application domain on Affordable Fusion and Exploitation Architectures, all other information as presented in the original 24 Apr 98 PRDA announcement remains valid.  Submission of white papers for initial consideration is requested by 10 December 1999.  All addresses, evaluation factors, etc. remain as originally published.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for 1 ea. design to develop high temperature packaging components and subassemblies for application in sensors that can operate in a 600 degree C environment. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from  Sienna Technologies, Inc., 19501 144th Avenue, NE, Suite F-500, Woodingville, WA 98072-000 under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1).The lack of competition is justified in that the process methodology for the fabrication of this package is currently subject to an invention disclosure in NASA, with the potential for patent award in the future. A full description of the packaging will compromise proprietary rights of NASA and Sienna Technologies. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 30,2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for the Propulsion Test Operation Building Phase II (Interior finish). The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to finish the interior of the pre-cast concrete buildings 3225-A and B.  Work shall include interior finishes, mechanical equipment, HVAC, electrical equipment including lighting and fire alarms.  Both building are approximately 2,100 square meters in size. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (150) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 233310 and $28.5 million, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about June 5, 2002, with an anticipated bid opening date of on or about July 9, 2002. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM.  Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: jason.edge@ssc.nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or  URL, for the NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page is http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A CDROM containing the specifications and drawings may be obtained from the Bid Distribution office; however, the closing date for the hard copy received shall be the same as the solicitation, inclusive of any amendments, released on the Internet.

<DESC>Points of Contact:  John H. Pletl, Program Manager, 315-330-7146, e-mail pletlj@rl.af.mil; Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308, e-mail bernhard@rl.af.mil.  THIS IS A REANNOUNCEMENT of this BAA which was originally published on 27 Nov 98, total funding is increased from $9.9M to a new total ceiling of $24.5M.  This reannouncement is for the convenience of industry,  and there are no other changes.  AFRL/Information Directorate, Rome, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the Information Directorate's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of ELINT Collection and Processing.  Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought.  The overall technical objectives of this BAA are the use of Artificial Intelligence applications, as well as enhanced or new digital processing hardware and software and to provide:  (1) Dynamic/updatable characterization and correlation databases that use existing multi-source near-real-time collection systems.  Measurable and descriptive emitter characteristics should also be used in the database as well as known specific operating characterization values;  (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved, labor reducing digital signal processing hardware and software analysis with high-capacity capability technology to offset manning reductions at operational units.  The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of requirements, which includes, but is not limited to the following:  (1) Target specific characteristics identification/correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Intermediate Processing Center (IPC) and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) levels; and (4) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms.  Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here:  (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation: Battlefield management depends heavily on EW assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources.  One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort:  (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing.  Dense signal environment dictates the need for automated/reduced manual collection, signal ID and sorting, and first-level signal processing.  This area should also allow for further discrimination or "flagging" of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values already lend themselves to characterization.  Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes should be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated efforts; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing:  Environment complexity as well as advanced collection hardware technology demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena.  Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems; (4) System miniaturization:  Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.  Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAs capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (2) The qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives; and (3) The offeror's record of past and present performance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  The technical criteria will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principle funding of this BAA and anticipated award of contracts will start approximately FY99.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $250K to $350K.  Total funding for this BAA is $24.5M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Foreign-owned offerors are advised that they be excluded from participating at the prime contract level.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, for information if they contemplate responding.   Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contract Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in AFR 31.205-18.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at a time of award.  In addition, to qualify as a responsible contractor, the offeror may need to have, or have access to, a certified and Government approved facility to support work under this BAA.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Vincent Palmiero, Chief, Policy and Management Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.  An information briefing is not planned.  To receive a copy of the AFRL "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), write ATTN: Lucille Argenzia, AFRL/IFK, 26 Electronics Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, or fax her at FAX 315-330-4728, or the guide may be accessed at: http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 01.  All responsible firms may submit a white paper, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission and reference BAA 99-02-IFKPA.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Sensor Applications and Demonstrations Division, Electronic Warfare Branch (AFRL/SNZW) is soliciting research proposals for the Lightweight Modular Support Jammer (LMSJ) Critical Experiment (CE) program.  The objective of the LMSJ effort is to do a requirements analysis, design, develop, fabricate, ground (field) test, and demonstrate a flyable brassboard model of a flexible and modular support jammer system.  Maximum emphasis shall be placed on a scalable architecture hardware configuration which has application to a wide range of host platform air vehicles from small expendable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fighter aircraft size external pods.  One, or a few transmitter/aperture modules may form the basic level support jammer system in a small expendable or recoverable UAV.  Many modules may be combined to result in a greater number of simultaneous threats to be jammed and a much higher power total system configuration for installation in a fighter pod.  Affordability is key factor in all expendable jammer applications.  The "front end" receiver subsystem for the LMSJ shall be, as a minimum, all, or elements of the AFRL/SNZW Advanced Threat Alert and Response (ATAR) digital-based receiver flyable brassboard now undergoing development in a laboratory CE program.  ATAR includes an Electronic Attack (EA) jammer techniques generator which shall perform the jamming signal selection and generation functions for the LMSJ brassboard.  The required ATAR receiver hardware will be furnished by the government to the LMSJ contractor.  ATAR data and interface documentation will also be provided by means of an associate contractor agreement in the LMSJ contract.  The LMSJ system shall be designed to effectively counter both communications and radar threats in the 20.0 Megahertz through 4.0 Gigahertz frequency band, in one or multiple sub-bands.  Sophisticated technologies and EA techniques shall be developed to adequately nullify modern threat radar and communications advancements.  Major technology and techniques advancements shall be also addressed in the areas of high power transmit array apertures, transmitter RF power amplifier device applications, both solid state and vacuum electronics, and support jamming techniques and algorithms.  The brassboarded hardware shall be fabricated and tested to withstand the rigors of a full flight test in a separate, future program, should such a program be eventually funded.  Tasks to be completed in this effort include a thorough analysis of the technical and operational requirements for a support jammer to defeat the radar and communications classes of threats in the above frequency band and a definition of those threat drivers which affect the overall system architecture.  A "Use Case" study shall be performed to identify and select candidate architectures for further development.  A hardware design, development, and fabrication phase will follow to produce the subject LMSJ brassboard.  Concept and hardware testing will involve a thorough evaluation in the AFRL/SNZW Integrated Demonstration and Application Laboratory (IDAL) to assure that the selected design meets EA objectives for the LMSJ modules.  IDAL testing shall be used to ready the brassboard for ground (field) testing to be conducted at a national open-air electronic warfare test range.  A final technical report, to include test data and results will be published.  A final program briefing to the Air Force will also be required.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA/BAA  solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/ .  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<SUBJECT>JOINT BATTLESPACE INFOSPHERE (JBI) FUSELET RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-00-09-IFKPA
<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>s 1999 report on "Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere", SAB-TR-99-02.  These reports are available at: http://www.sab.hq.af.mil/Archives/index.htm. PRDA Scope: This announcement seeks to acquire the technologies necessary to prototype demonstrable results for the following:1. JBI Fuselets; 
2. JBI Fuselet Scripting Language and Rule Sets; 3. JBI Fuselet Server and Library; 4. Tools for JBI Fuselet Execution Monitoring and Management as well as to answer the following kinds of research questions:  1.  How can we use agent technology to develop JBI fuselets, and DASADA technology to model, simulate, and control their combinatorial structure and behavior?  2.  How can we use DASADA technology to model and build JBIP components like the Fuselet Server and Fuselet Library, and examine/control their interaction with fuselets, information objects, clients, and other JBIP components?  3.  How can we use DASADA gauging technology to determine the "fusability" of information objects, and what kinds of fuselets would be appropriate for them?  4.  How can we build off of this to provide the scripting, diagnostic, repair, configuration, monitoring, inspection, and management tools needed by the JFC Information Management Staff?  JBI Characteristics:  At the foundation of the JBI is a JBI Platform (JBIP) of protocols, processes, and common core functions that permit participating applications and organizations to share and exchange critical mission information in a timely manner.  It provides uniform mechanisms for publishing new and updated objects into the JBI, and promptly alerts any JBI clients that are subscribing to such objects.  These properties enable dynamic information flows among client programs of the JBI, serving to integrate the clients to conduct a single mission.  The operation of the JBI depends on the proper flow of information via dynamic publish/subscribe linkages.  If some aspect of this automated information flow is not working properly, the Joint Force Commander (JFC) Information Management Staff will need to diagnose and fix the problem quickly.  Perhaps a JBI fuselet, further described below (and the focus of this PRDA), has failed and is no longer subscribing to and processing its inputs.  To monitor and repair the JBI, the Information Management Staff will need to be familiar with the information structure represented in the JBI, and will need tools to inspect objects, clients, and fuselets that participate in the structure.  JBI Fuselets:  A fuselet is small program that subscribes to JBI information and publishes one or more new objects as a result of receiving the information being subscribed to.  Characteristics of fuselets for the JBI include the following: - Fuselets are written using a scripting language by Information Management Staff.  They can be created from scratch using scripting tools and rule sets, or can be extracted by the JBI Fuselet Server (described below) from a library of fuselets, used as is or configured/modified to meet mission requirements.  Fuslets can be used to encode a commander's standing orders (e.g., "policy"). -  Fuselets operate on a set of rules (e.g., boolean and probabilistic IF-THEN rules) - they do not exhibit common sense or judgement during execution. -  Fuselets perform transformation and aggregation functions to transform data into knowls publish/subscribe mechanism. -  Fuselets are part of the "glue" that makes the linkages that cause information in the JBI to flow to the right places in the right forms. -  Fuselets use JBI's Structured Common Representation (SCR), and are often designed to be pertinent to particular object types (like squadron) and levels (like wing level). -  Tools are needed to configure, monitor, manage and repair fuselets and their associated information structures during execution. -  Relevant COTS/GOTS technologies include the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), ontologies, agents and agent-markup-languages, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Common Object Model (COM), Distributed Common Object Model (DCOM), Visual Basic, Java/Jini, and JavaScript.  However, in the implementation of fuselets, there exists the need to be mindful of security concerns (e.g., those associated with JavaScript and mobile code).  The JBI Fuselet Server mentioned above is part of the JBIP that manages and executes fuselets.  It utilizes a library of fuselets designed to support generic and mission-specific requirements for which the JBI is stood up.  The typical information objects that a fuselet works with consist of a set of attribute/value pairs that can be used to express arbitrary data structures.  Information objects have associated metadata attributes to aid in JBI query, subscription, and management (dealing with storage access and security) processes.  Agent-based Technology Programs:  Agents have been used for applications as diverse as information search, filtering, message routing, and network control.  Commercial development of agent technology has focused largely on e-commerce applications such as web searching, is primarily focused on single-agent systems, and is generally immature for many defense unique requirements.  Therefore, DARPA and AFRL are conducting research initiatives that focus on large-scale, dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems.  Some representative programs are: -  Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS):  Focuses on developing and demonstrating techniques to safely control, coordinate and manage large systems of autonomous software agents.
http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=126
http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFT/IFTB/coabs/coabs.html. -  Autonomous Negotiating Teams (ANTs):  Utilizes highly decentralized and autonomous negotiation of tasks, roles and allocations, to provide solutions for challenging distributed allocation problems
http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFT/IFTB/ants/ants.html  - DARPA Agent Mark Up Language (DAML):  Create an Agent Mark-Up Language (DAML) built upon XML that allows users to provide machine-readable semantic annotations for specific communities of interest and tools that embed DAML markup on to web pages and other information sources in a manner that is transparent and beneficial to the users. http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=347
 - Active Templates (uses agent technology):  Develop lightweight planning and execution management software to automate military operations, maintaining a causal model of the situation and providing incremental payoff as new automated functions are added and the causal model is improved.  http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=332
The Composition Problem:  The Dynamic Assembly for Systems Adaptability, Dependability, and Assurance (DASADA) Program is a FY 2000 new-start initiative sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to address current deficiencies in the composition of systems. DASADA technology will enable system architecture refinement with guarantees that critical system properties will be assured through design principles that guide the selection, adaptation, and dynamic run-time assembly of appropriate system components. DASADA adopts a three-faceted concurrent engineering paradigm for adaptable, dependable, and high assurance mission critical systems: Continual Design, Continual Coordination, and Continual Validation.  In this model, components are selected or constructed, and customized and evaluated before system assembly (Continual Design), during system assembly (Continual Coordination), and after system assembly (Continual Validation) to ensure that they can and do operate together with the rest of the system, in its current context, and within tolerated bounds. Continual Validation is particularly essential for assured applications because assurances that may have been met at initial system design time may not prove to be appropriate for field conditions, which are subject to rapid change while the system is running.  Such applications typically cannot be "taken down" for long reengineering or enhancement cycles, but must be dynamically assembled in response to feedback from run-time gauges of functional and non-functional system properties.  Two necessary bases for all three facets of dynamic assembly are:  (1) being able to precisely determine and usefully specify the room for variation in components and their composition, and (2) being able to measure that components fit, and continue to fit, together as system and context change, within functional and non-functional tolerances permitted by dynamically evolving system requirements. The measurement probes must be insertable into legacy as well as new components and compositions, and "displayable" to humans and automated agents as useful and quickly interpretable gauges to prevent inappropriate system assemblies, and to trigger re-assemblies promptly when needed.
More information on the DASADA Program can be found at:
http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/dasada/index.html   http://schafercorp-ballston.com/dasada/index2.html   http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=HTMLCBD_ALL&docid=cite=SN475649.  PRDA Approach:  It is anticipated that offerors will investigate and apply COTS (e.g., XML) and GOTS (e.g., DASADA) technologies to incrementally develop a component-based framework comprised of capabilities for the development (scripting language and tools), execution (rule/constraint monitoring and enforcement mechanisms), and management (JBI Fuselet Sever/Library functions) of JBI fuselets and associated components (information objects, other JBI clients, and the JBIP).  It is envisioned that: (a) agent technology will play a major role in the development of JBI fuselets, and (b) the DASADA Program will provide many of the technologies (e.g., Architecture Design Languages (ADLs), design-time and run-time gauges, and tools for dynamic assembly/re-assembly) required to ensure that fuselets are designed to properly operate together, operate with other JBI clients, and operate with JBIP core services in the context of the JBI SCR and dynamically changing JBI mission requirements.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches.  Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software prototypes and demonstrations. Additional information concerning this PRDA 00-09 can be found at: 
http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda.prda-main.html.
Principal funding of the PRDA and the anticipated award of efforts as a result of this PRDA will start in 2Q FY01, and will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed.  Individual awards will not normally exceed six (6) months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50K to $250K.  Total funding for exploratory development and demonstration under this PRDA is anticipated at $1.2M over four (4) fiscal years.  Offerors are encouraged to submit one or more white papers that address exploratory development with demonstrable results.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. 
Offerors are required to submit (5) copies of a 15 page (or less) white paper with a cover letter. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Reference PRDA-00-09-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTD, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title. Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, White paper type; Section B:  Effort objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  Also, Small Businesses only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. Evaluation of proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge, 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). 
Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is excluded at the prime contract level.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. 
The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award. 
The cutoff date for submission of white papers is 18 Oct 00 for FY01, 15 Oct 01 for FY02, 15 Oct 02 for FY03 and 15 Oct 03 for FY04. This PRDA is open and effective until cancelled. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors for this announcement.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreement and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Ralph M. Lentz, Lt Col, Chief, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746.  When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems that have been previously brought to the attention of the contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level. To receive a copy of the AFRL/IFK "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), write ATTN:  Carol Furgol, AFRL/IFK, 26 Electronics Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4515, or fax her at FAX 315-330-4728, or the guide may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html 
All responsible firms may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address, and reference PRDA-00-09-IFKPA.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

Reclamation intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes for this work on a noncompetitive basis.  Because the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are concerned  about the nature and location of their traditional cultural properties and sacred sites, and access thereto, Reclamation has deemed they are the only entity that can reasonably provide this erosion control. The NAICS is 234990 and the size standard is $28.5 million.

<DESC>It is the intention of this solicitation to obtain maintenance services to the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system; and electrical system including emergency generators at Bldg. W-143, Sewells Point, Norfolk, Virginia.  The United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps have acquired a contract to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end information services through a common computing and communications environment.  The contract ensures the transmission of voice, video, and data information. Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS), 13600 EDS Drive, Herndon, VA  20171, has been awarded the contract to perform the required services. In addition to EDS performing the service to provide comprehensive information technology capabilities, EDS has been tasked with maintaining a proper environment for the mainframe equipment that is housed in allocated spaces provided to the contractor.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Commander Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) and NMCI contractor (EDS) is established to provide on-site maintenance (emergency service, recurring, and preventative) of all systems within the government furnished facility that was allocated to support this operation.  Because of the MOU, EDS maintains the HVAC systems and generators to support the computer equipment in their allocated spaces.  Support for the remainder of the building?s HVAC systems and generators not associated with the NMCI contract are the subjects of this requirement.  Systems specifications indicate that all the HVAC systems and generators are on the same circuit and there are no separate controls to regulate the flow of air condition or the heating system.  Since EDS maintains their portion of the systems, it would only be feasible for EDS to maintain the entire system throughout the building.  If the government elects to procure services from a separate contractor, there would be no way to determine where EDS level of responsibility ends and where the other contractor?s level of responsibility begins. This proposed contract action is for the services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6-302.

Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308; (Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil).  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the following two topic areas. 1) WAVEFORM DIVERSITY FOR AMTI/GMTI/IMAGING APPLICATIONS.  The objective of this task is to develop and demonstrate spatially and temporally adaptive RF sensor technology for application to air, space, and ground systems operating in isolation or in concert with other sensor systems.  Environmental awareness is critical to the process of spatial and temporal adaptivity via transmit waveform diversity.  Any sensor incorporating this technology must be capable of sensing sources of electromagnetic radiation such as other sensor systems, communications and navigation signals, and selecting regions of the spectrum best suited to the mission(s), given the surveillance region, coverage and revisit requirements, as well as the EM environment.  Appropriate waveforms and parameters are selected accordingly.  Spatial-temporal adaptivity adds several unique features to radar systems.  Namely, it provides the ability to deny a coherent sidelobe reference signal to an off-mainlobe enemy receiver desiring to operate in a non-cooperative bistatic mode of operation or attempting to intercept communications signals.  The integration of joint adaptivity on transmit and receive provides spatial-temporal modulation.  This allows the radiation of signals with different information content in various directions and full adaptivity on receive. This is fundamental to advance multi-mission sensor concepts.  This includes a formed mainlobe for radar applications in one (or more) direction while simultaneously communicating with field units, fighting forces, and field commanders in other directions.  Spatial adaptivity methods will be investigated and evaluated for monostatic and bistatic applications to radar AMTI, GMTI and imaging applications.  Spatial adaptivity will be investigated in the context of combining radar operation at selected angles with the embedding of communications or navigation signals at other angles.  Finally, the adaptive radar signal processing algorithm(s) must work in conjunction with the added spatial-temporal adaptivity.  Appropriate algorithms shall be developed to work in concert with waveform diverse radars.  (POC:  Mr. Paul Antonik, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-7057; Paul.Antonik@rl.af.mil.)  A related topic area is: 2) COMMONALITY AMONG MULTI-MISSION ADAPTIVE RADAR ALGORITHMS.  The objective of this task is to establish a set of parameters, which describes the various modes of operation in emerging airborne/space borne radar technologies.  Additionally, focus on the detection of advanced threats, or threats under cover, will be emphasized.  There is a growing need to improve interference (clutter and jamming) rejection not just in the angle-Doppler sidelobes, but in the mainlobe as well.  Improved target (air and ground) detection will also be achieved under this effort.  This leads to polarization as a natural discriminant in the development and demonstration of these adaptive radar signal-processing algorithms.  Furthermore, the integration of polarimetric processing with multi-channel adaptive processing (STAP) offers an opportunity to optimize degrees of freedom selection and processing domain (element space versus beamspace, multi-channel feed reflector systems versus fully populated and adaptive phased arrays, etc).  Additionally, compatibility of the filtering process (STAP) with the (CFAR) detection process (as well as discrimination) is essential in this effort.  In the initial stage, parametric analysis will be used to optimize performance.  For different radar configurations and geometries, variation in coherent dwell, degrees of freedom, and waveform parameters, are essential segments in signal processing optimization.  Specifically, the focus of this effort shall be on multiple modes of operations for air targets, ground targets, imaging and SIGINT missions.  The need to interleave waveforms modes further compounds problems in the signal/data processor, since one unit will have to perform all functions under all modes of operation.  As such, adaptive algorithms are to be included in the suite of algorithms under consideration.  Finally, the algorithm suite developed under this effort must be applicable to space radar systems designed to operate in either multi-sensor or single sensor configurations. (POC:  Dr. Braham Himed, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-2551; Braham.Himed@rl.af.mil.)  Demonstrations utilizing the AFRL Surveillance Facility are permitted and encouraged under this BAA.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution.  Small business should only send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN:  Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; Section C:  Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.   All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Braham Himed, PhD. Reference BAA-00-07-IFKPA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White papers will be accepted until September 30, 2005.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award.    Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.   Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) The Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort.  The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to white papers.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY-00  Individual awards will not normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year.

<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>s Information Directorate (AFRL/IF) and the National Institute of Justice's Office of Science and Technology (NIJ/OST) are soliciting proposals for the development and demonstration of innovative technology to better detect concealed weapons (CW) in the hands of criminals--the number one technology priority of the state and local law enforcement community--and to provide law enforcement officers and military personnel engaged in peace keeping the ability to conduct surveillance through exterior and interior building walls in hostage rescue situations.  Technology that lends itself to school-security/school- safety is also of interest.  AFRL/IF and NIJ/OST will entertain responses to this solicitation that propose either development of new technology or demonstration and evaluation of existing technology.  Of particular interest are technologies that: (1) are low cost in production; (2) are portable, optimally handheld or as small as possible; (3) provide the ability to detect weapons or survey individuals through walls at a distance; (4) can be used to enhance school safety; and, in regard to weapons detection, (5) can detect weapons with little or no metal content, and explosive materials.  One area of interest is the detection of living humans through walls at ranges of up to 100 feet (30 meters).  An awareness of where living people are located within a building is necessary when dealing with hostage situations, terrorism, counter terrorism, etc.  AFRL/IF and NIJ/OST have also been developing technology to detect both metallic and non-metallic weapons (guns and edged weapons) that are concealed beneath a persons clothing.  This CWD technology development program has been ongoing since 1995 and has the goal of standoff detection of these concealed weapons at a range of 10 meters.  Finally, approaches are sought for the purpose of enabling the transition of sensor collection technology to the resource allocation and information management process that logically occurs further down stream in the CONOPs for special operations and law enforcement.   PROGRAM SCOPE:  Technical areas of interest include phenomenological issues associated with TWS and CWD, TWS and CWD breadboard/brassboard/prototype development, enabling technology development, enhancing technologies, and technologies for the purpose of enabling the transition of sensor collection technology to the resource allocation and information management process that must occur for the purpose of information dissemination and utilization.  TWS phenomenological issues include the reflective, transmissive, and absorptive effects of the atmosphere and various wall materials and their effect on TWS performance.  Of particular interest are technologies that are capable of "seeing through" or penetrating metallic walls.  Phenomenological issues associated with living humans such as movement, heart beat, respiration, sounds, etc. are also of great interest to the TWS program.  Phenomenological issues associated with both metallic and nonmetallic weapons, attenuation and reflective characteristics of various types of clothing (i.e. winter vs. summer clothing, heavy leather etc.) is of interest to the CWD program.   Applicable TWS and CWD breadboards/brassboards/prototypes include but are not limited to imaging and non-imaging radar systems, acoustic technology, radiometers, low dose backscatter systems, etc.  The proposal must clearly explain how the technology developed is compatible with or is capable of exploiting the appropriate phenomenology.  Enabling technologies are those technologies that are not currently mature enough to integrate into a TWS or CWD system but whose development is necessary to meet the long term cost, performance, size, and/or implementationgoals.  These enabling technologies include unique antenna designs, low cost/producible MMIC designs, scanning improvements, etc.  The proposal must explain how these enabling technologies will improve the performance of the TWS or CWD system.  Enhancing technologies are those technologies that are not directly part of the TWS or CWD system but the integration of such technology could enhance the overall system performance.  An example of an enhancing TWS technology is a tag that could be worn by a person that positively identifies the "tagged" person.  The tag could also be used to alleviate some of the detrimental phenomenological issues associated with various wall types by reflecting or transmitting a much stronger signal than would be otherwise be reflected or emitted from the person being surveyed.  In the case of CWD an enhancing technology might be a unique approach to processing that would interpret the sensor data and automatically decide whether the person had a concealed weapon.  Sensor technology transition, resource allocation and information management technology includes proposals that deal with infrastructure backbone including information processing/exploitation/dissemination and the necessary telecommunications to enable successful interoperability between special operations units or law enforcement agencies.  The proposals will be broken into four categories; TWS, CWD, sensor technology transition and interoperability.  The offeror must also state whether the technology proposed is near-term or long-term.  Near-term proposals are those that propose technology that can at least be demonstrated in a brassboard form within 2 years.  Long-term proposals must propose technology that can be demonstrated in a breadboard form within 2 years and brassboard form within 5 or 6 years.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) overall scientific and technical merit; (2) potential contributions/relevance to NIJ, Air Force and DoD; (3) capabilities and experience;(4) plans and capabilities to accomplish technology transfer; and (5) total cost and cost realism.  (NOTE:  Cost realism will be used as an evaluation criterion only in proposals, which have significantly under or over estimated the cost to complete the effort).  In addition, the Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the requirements of the effort.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Prospective offerors should first submit a 5 - 10 page white paper that describes their technical approach, an estimate of the cost, a schedule, a description of the deliverables (i.e. final report, breadboard, brassboard, etc.) and whether the proposal is intended to be short-term or long-term technology development.  Based on the technical, financial and schedule content of the white paper the government will decide whether to request a proposal.  Offerors are required to submit an original and (5) copies of their white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution, to AFRL/IFEM, ATTN: David Ferris, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114 by 7 Jul 1999.  Also, small business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified only) to ATTN:  Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered.  Offerors must mark their white papers with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.   White papers are limited to a total page count of 10 pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  NIJ has budgeted approximately $4.0 million in FY99.  Additional funding will be available in FY00 and FY01.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $15 million.  Proposals should be for up to 24-months of effort, and range in value between $500,000 - $1M.  This effort should include those tasks necessary to get to a breadboard system (in the case of long term technology) or a brassboard system (in the case of near term technology).  It is anticipated that the effort will be modified via an engineering change proposal for continued technology development with the ultimate goal of a demonstration.  The demonstration will depend on the type of technology developed and whether the technology is considered near term or long term.  Only government evaluators will make selections under this BAA.  Personnel from the Air Force Research Laboratory and the National Institute of Justice, as well as other federal agencies and state and local police agencies will evaluate proposals. 
Most awards are expected O/A 17 October 99.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, and (315)330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Vincent Palmiero, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to replace the previous RFI Description in its entirety with the following:

This is a request for information (RFI), part of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's market research to support acquisition planning, as described in FAR 15.201(e). FAR 52.215-3 applies: The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs. Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. This solicitation is issued for the following purpose: The Bureau?s Office of Procurement is trying to determine whether or not there are currently available Automated Purchasing Systems (APSs) that would meet its needs, but which it currently does not have. (If there are such APSs, and the Office decides to purchase one, then the Office would proceed with an acquisition appropriate to the circumstances, in conformance with the FAR.) To meet the Office?s needs, an APS would have to: (a) be a commercial, off-the-shelf, and Web-based system, operating in a Windows environment; (b) provide a completely seamless and paperless procurement process; (c) handle all types of procurements, at any dollar level, from acquisition planning, through receipt of requisition and award of contract or order, to contract closeout; (d) produce all the necessary documents, allow for coordination and approval among participants in the procurement, and provide the capability of reminding the contract administrator when a new action must be taken; (e) contain continuously updated electronic versions of the FAR, the Department of the Treasury Acquisition Regulation (DTAR) and all the forms needed in the procurement process; (f) provide flexible search capability for the FAR and DTAR databases; (g) be capable of direct interface with external systems such as the Treasury Acquisition Data System (TADS), the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the Central Contractor Registry (CCR); (h) include the capability to query the system?s database and produce reports as needed; (i) be ready to accept XML tagging and be digital certificate ready; and (j) conform to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 per 36 CFR, Part 1194. The system would be accessible by web interface by approximately 45 users in the Bureau?s Washington DC and Fort Worth TX facilities. Initially, it would operate with no direct interface to other internal systems, although the potential for interface is desirable. The Office is seeking a vendor whose strategic vision for product development is consistent with Federal E-Government strategies, especially as relates to the Integrated Acquisition Environment of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).  Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer. Such information should include: (a) the technical capabilities of the system offered: (b) a statement as to whether or not the system can accommodate specific needs, and, if so, a description of which functions(s) of the system can be configured and the relative degree of difficulty in configuration; (c) the approximate timeframe for installation of the system and training of user personnel; (d) the price for installation, training, and maintenance/update/support of the system for one year; (e) whether or not there is an existing Federal user group for the system; and (f) a list of Federal procurement office locations currently using the system, including the names and addresses for Agency points of contact. Interested vendors should also indicate whether or not they have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and, if so, provide the schedule and contract number. Information should be submitted by the date, and to the contact point, specified below. E-mail is preferred, but fax and mail are acceptable. E-mail and fax numbers are shown below. The mailing address is the Contracting Office Address shown above, marked to the attention of George Leininger, Room 705-A.*****

<DESC>Points of Contact: Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315/330-2308 (Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil); David Ferris, Program Manager, 315/330-4408 (David.Ferris@rl.af.mil).  BAA 99-04-IFKPA is amended as follows:  Delete all information under "General Information" and substitute the following:  "GENERAL INFORMATION: Prospective offerors should first submit a 5 - 10 page white paper that describes their technical approach, an estimate of the cost, a schedule, a description of the deliverables (i.e. final report, breadboard, brassboard, etc.) and whether the proposal is intended to be short-term or long-term technology development. Based on the technical, financial and schedule content of the white paper the government will decide whether to request a proposal. Offerors are required to submit an original and (5) copies of their white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution, to AFRL/IFEM, ATTN: David Ferris, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114.  White papers may be submitted throughout the life of this BAA.  Contract awards will be made throughout the life of this BAA as funding becomes available.  Also, small business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered. Offerors must mark their white papers with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers are limited to a total page count of 10 pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. NIJ has budgeted approximately $4.0 million in FY99. Additional funding will be available in FY00, FY01, FY02 and FY03.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $15 million. Proposals should be for up to 24-months of effort, and range in value between $500,000 - $1M. This effort should include those tasks necessary to get to a breadboard system (in the case of long term technology) or a brassboard system (in the case of near term technology). It is anticipated that the effort will be modified via an engineering change proposal for continued technology development with the ultimate goal of a demonstration. The demonstration will depend on the type of technology developed and whether the technology is considered near term or long term. Only government evaluators will make selections under this BAA.  Personnel from the Air Force Research Laboratory and the National Institute of Justice, as well as other federal agencies and state and local police agencies will evaluate proposals.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, and (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Lt. Col. Reid S. Lerum, Chief, Contracting Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>POC Dr. Daniel Benincasa, Laboratory Program Manager, 315-330-3555, email:  Daniel.Benincasa@rl.af.mil; Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308 email:  Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil.  This announcement is republished for the convenience of industry.  NOTE:  The BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 01.  No changes have been made in the technical content, although minor changes such as office symbols, etc., have been updated. Audio/Speech Processing AFRL/IF is soliciting white papers for research and development in audio and speech processing technology. Basic research and engineering solutions using new and innovative approaches will be sought. This BAA addresses the development of technology for in-house and advanced development programs to satisfy DoD and law enforcement requirements for (1) Message Sorting and Translation; (2) Interference Reduction; (3) Voice Countermeasures; (4) Jam-Resistant Communications; (5) Man-Machine Interface; and (6) Background Sound Identification. A description of these six areas of interest are as follows: (1) MESSAGE SORTING AND TRANSLATION -- Technology is being sought for the automatic sorting, routing and translation of messages. Robust automatic speech recognition (automatic speaker, language and event/activity) techniques and methods are sought for use in tactical (Avg. 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio, &lt;5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time) environments. In addition, fusion of other pieces of data with speech recognition results is also of interest. Finally, papers related to voice to voice language translation are also sought. (2) INTERFERENCE REDUCTION -- Technology is being sought to reduce/remove interference from audio signals in tactical communications. The signal of interest may be either voice, Morse code or data. Interferences are undesired signals and noise. The removal process must be on-line, real time and work without human 
intervention. In addition, the techniques shall require minimal training and be effective in negative signal to noise ratios. (3) VOICE  COUNTERMEASURES -- This area includes techniques such as voice  concatenation, synthesis, and transformation. Techniques that perform  with limited training data, and in noisy environments are sought. (4)  JAM-RESISTANT SPEECH COMMUNICATIONS -- Of interest is the development of  low bit rate speech communication algorithms for multiple bit rate jam  resistant communications. Papers should address techniques below 2400  bits/second and be applicable to the tactical (noisy, preserve speaker  identity) environment. (5) MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE (MMI) - AFRL/IF is developing MMI concepts to meet tactical audio processing  requirements. These requirements are hands busy/eyes busy, and are  becoming more complex as additional capabilities are added. Of interest  are the development of new MMI techniques and strategies to improve  efficiency and reduce errors for these applications. Since there are  multiple applications and tasks, it is also of interest to understand  the interrelationships between various workloads (visual, manual, oral,  etc.) and input/output modalities for transportability of techniques to  other tasks within the same or different domains. Of high interest is  the ability to identify tasks where speech synthesis and recognition are appropriate modalities and provide a means for estimating their  performance. (6) BACKGROUND SOUND IDENTIFICATION -- This technical area  seeks new and innovative techniques to identify sounds based on features  extracted from an analysis of the background noise. This technology area is also for tactical use (Avg. 9 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, &lt;5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time). Deliverables for each area of this BAA will be technical reports, and when appropriate, demonstrations. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (7) page  white paper. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B:  Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Daniel Benincasa, Reference RL-BAA 97-07-PKPX, AFRL/IFEC, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Applications to Tactical Speech Processing, (3)  Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (4) Compatibility with RL In- House Efforts, (5) Cost Effectiveness and Consistency. No further evaluation criteria will be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Evaluation will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 98. Individual awards will not normally $100K to $1000K. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Total funding for this BAA is not expected to exceed $6.2M from all sources. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point for information if they contemplate responding. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer or program manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Lt Col Ralph M. Lentz, Chief, Contracting Division, at 315-330-7746. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the  source selection process. An informational briefing is not planned. This  BAA is open and effective until 36 months after publication of this  announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- JOINT BATTLESPACE INFOSPHERE (JBI) FUSELET RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-00-09-IFKPA
<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>s 1999 report on Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere, SAB-TR-99-02.  These reports are available at: http://www.sab.hq.af.mil/Archives/index.htm. PRDA Scope: This announcement seeks to acquire the technologies necessary to prototype demonstrable results for the following:  1. JBI Fuselets:  What are they?  How do they work, especially in the context of the JBI?  2. JBI Fuselet Scripting and Rule Sets:  How do you easily build and govern fuselets?  3. JBI Fuselet Server and Library:   How do you store fuselets for reuse?  Deploy them quickly into operation?  Configure them?  4. Tools for JBI Fuselet Execution Monitoring and Management:   How do you monitor fuselets, control them, fix or kill them when they don't work right?  as well as to answer the following kinds of research questions:  1. How do we develop JBI fuselets and model, simulate, and control their combinatorial structure and behavior?  2. What technology can be used to model and build JBI Platform (JBIP) components like the Fuselet Server and Fuselet Library, and examine/control their interaction with fuselets, information objects, clients, and other JBIP components  3. How can we use component-connector probe and gauge technology to determine the fusibility of information objects, and what kinds of fuselets would be appropriate for them  4. How can we build off of all this to provide the scripting, diagnostic, repair, configuration, monitoring, inspection, and management tools needed by the JFC Information Management Staff  5. Can fuselets circumvent publish/subscribe/query mechanisms?  Can they go directly to the data source to monitor/get information?   Should they be able connect directly to a client to provide information?   Are they allowed to roam the network?   Directly connect clients?  6.  To what extent must fuselets be light-weight?  To what extent do you embed rule-based/procedural logic and ontology-aware infrastructure within fuselets themselves?  7. Is it allowed, and how do you go about chaining fuselets together?  Assembly-line (LEGO? block) style or autonomous interaction (bee hive).  8. Is mobile code an illegal mode of operation for fuselets?   This PRDA seeks to be open to ALL innovative approaches, and is seeking demonstrable results as there is a need for proof-of-concept evaluations.  Particular attention is given to the JBI principle concerning off-the-shelf solutions, i.e.: Adopt where possible.  Adapt where necessary.  Build as a last resort.  Finally, this PRDA is focused on the research and development of fuselet concepts and components.  While it may be necessary to propose JBI-like infrastructures to support them, these infrastructures are not the main emphasis of this research.  Turn-key solutions to the entire JBI solution space should be avoided with the emphasis of the research and development focused on fuselet technology.   JBI Characteristics:  At the foundation of the JBI is a JBI Platform (JBIP) of protocols, processes, and common core functions that permit participating applications and organizatios publish/subscribe mechanism.  Fuselets are part of the glue that makes the linkages that cause information in the JBI to flow to the right places in the right forms.  Fuselets use JBI's Structured Common Representation (SCR), and are often designed to be pertinent to particular object types (like squadron) and levels (like wing level).  Tools are needed to configure, monitor, manage and repair fuselets and their associated information structures during execution.  Relevant COTS/GOTS technologies include, but are not limited to, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), ontologies, agents and agent-markup-languages, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Common Object Model (COM), Distributed Common Object Model (DCOM), Visual Basic, Java/Jini, and JavaScript.  However, in the implementation of fuselets, there exists the need to be mindful of security concerns (e.g., those associated with JavaScript and mobile code).  The JBI Fuselet Server mentioned above is part of the JBIP that manages and executes fuselets.  It utilizes a library of fuselets designed to support generic and mission-specific requirements for which the JBI is stood up.  The typical information objects that a fuselet works with consist of a set of attribute/value pairs that can be used to express arbitrary data structures. Information objects have associated metadata attributes to aid in JBI query, subscription,  publication, and management (dealing with storage access and security) processes.  PRDA Approach:  It is anticipated that offerors will investigate and apply off-the-shelf technologies to incrementally develop a component-based framework comprised of capabilities for the development (scripting language and tools), execution (rule/constraint monitoring and enforcement mechanisms), and management (JBI Fuselet Sever/Library functions) of JBI fuselets and associated components (information objects, other JBI clients, and the JBIP).  Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches.  It is desirable for the Government to acquire software that it is completely maintainable and modifiable without reliance on any non-delivered computer programs or documentation.  It is also desirable for the Government to acquire open, non-proprietary software solutions that offer functionality across a number of operating environments using various infrastructures. Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software prototypes, and demonstrations.  Additional information concerning this PRDA 00-09 can be found at:  http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html.  Principal funding of the PRDA and the anticipated award of efforts as a result of this PRDA will start in 2Q FY01, and will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed.   Individual awards will not normally exceed six (6)  months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50K to $150K.   Total funding for exploratory development and demonstration under this PRDA is anticipated at $1.2M over four (4) fiscal years starting in FY01. Offerors are encouraged to submit one or more white papers that address exploratory development with demonstrable results.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit (5) copies of a 10 page (or less) white paper with a cover letter. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Reference PRDA-00-09-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTD, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title. Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, Principle Investigator; Section B:  Effort objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. Also, Small Businesses only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  Evaluation of proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge, 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is excluded at the prime contract level.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at 1-800-352-3572.  The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award.  The cutoff date for submission of white papers is 18 Oct 00 for FY01, 15 Oct 01 for FY02, 15 Oct 02 for FY03 and 15 Oct 03 for FY04.  This PRDA is open and effective until cancelled.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors for this announcement.  Routine questions are not considered to be significant concerns and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreement and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Reid S. Lerum, Lt Col, Chief, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746.  When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems that have been previously brought to the attention of the contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.

<DESC>s 1999
report on Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere, SAB-TR-99-02. These
reports are available at: http://www.sab.hq.af.mil/Archives/index.htm. PRDA
Scope: This announcement seeks to acquire the technologies necessary to
prototype demonstrable results for the following: 1. JBI Fuselets: What are
they? How do they work, especially in the context of the JBI? 2. JBI Fuselet
Scripting and Rule Sets: How do you easily build and govern fuselets? 3. JBI
Fuselet Server and Library: How do you store fuselets for reuse? Deploy them
quickly into operation? Configure them? 4. Tools for JBI Fuselet Execution
Monitoring and Management: How do you monitor fuselets, control them, fix or
kill them when they don't work right? as well as to answer the following
kinds of research questions: 1. How do we develop JBI fuselets and model,
simulate, and control their combinatorial structure and behavior? 2. What
technology can be used to model and build JBI Platform (JBIP) components
like the Fuselet Server and Fuselet Library, and examine/control their
interaction with fuselets, information objects, clients, and other JBIP
components 3. How can we use component-connector probe and gauge technology
to determine the fusibility of information objects, and what kinds of
fuselets would be appropriate for them 4. How can we build off of all this
to provide the scripting, diagnostic, repair, configuration, monitoring,
inspection, and management tools needed by the JFC Information Management
Staff 5. Can fuselets circumvent publish/subscribe/query mechanisms? Can
they go directly to the data source to monitor/get information? Should they
be able connect directly to a client to provide information? Are they
allowed to roam the network? Directly connect clients? 6. To what extent
must fuselets be light-weight? To what extent do you embed
rule-based/procedural logic and ontology-aware infrastructure within
fuselets themselves? 7. Is it allowed, and how do you go about chaining
fuselets together? Assembly-line (LEGO? block) style or autonomous
interaction (bee hive). 8. Is mobile code an illegal mode of operation for
fuselets? This PRDA seeks to be open to ALL innovative approaches, and is
seeking demonstrable results as there is a need for proof-of-concept
evaluations. Particular attention is given to the JBI principle concerning
off-the-shelf solutions, i.e.: Adopt where possible. Adapt where necessary.
Build as a last resort. Finally, this PRDA is focused on the research and
development of fuselet concepts and components. While it may be necessary to
propose JBI-like infrastructures to support them, these infrastructures are
not the main emphasis of this research. Turn-key solutions to the entire JBI
solution space should be avoided with the emphasis of the research and
development focused on fuselet technology. JBI Characteristics: At the
foundation of the JBI is a JBI Platform (JBIP) of protocols, processes, and
common core functions that permit participating applications and
organizats publish/subscribe mechanism. Fuselets are part of the glue that makes
the linkages that cause information in the JBI to flow to the right places
in the right forms. Fuselets use JBI's Structured Common Representation
(SCR), and are often designed to be pertinent to particular object types
(like squadron) and levels (like wing level). Tools are needed to configure,
monitor, manage and repair fuselets and their associated information
structures during execution. Relevant COTS/GOTS technologies include, but
are not limited to, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), ontologies, agents
and agent-markup-languages, Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA), Common Object Model (COM), Distributed Common Object Model (DCOM),
Visual Basic, Java/Jini, and JavaScript. However, in the implementation of
fuselets, there exists the need to be mindful of security concerns (e.g.,
those associated with JavaScript and mobile code). The JBI Fuselet Server
mentioned above is part of the JBIP that manages and executes fuselets. It
utilizes a library of fuselets designed to support generic and
mission-specific requirements for which the JBI is stood up. The typical
information objects that a fuselet works with consist of a set of
attribute/value pairs that can be used to express arbitrary data structures.
Information objects have associated metadata attributes to aid in JBI query,
subscription, publication, and management (dealing with storage access and
security) processes. PRDA Approach: It is anticipated that offerors will
investigate and apply off-the-shelf technologies to incrementally develop a
component-based framework comprised of capabilities for the development
(scripting language and tools), execution (rule/constraint monitoring and
enforcement mechanisms), and management (JBI Fuselet Sever/Library
functions) of JBI fuselets and associated components (information objects,
other JBI clients, and the JBIP). Technical solutions should emphasize the
use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible
approaches. It is desirable for the Government to acquire software that it
is completely maintainable and modifiable without reliance on any
non-delivered computer programs or documentation. It is also desirable for
the Government to acquire open, non-proprietary software solutions that
offer functionality across a number of operating environments using various
infrastructures. Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software
prototypes, and demonstrations. Additional information concerning this PRDA
00-09 can be found at:
http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html. Principal funding of
the PRDA and the anticipated award of efforts as a result of this PRDA will
start in 2Q FY01, and will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative
agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work
proposed. Individual awards will not normally exceed six (6) months in
duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50K to $150K. Total
funding for exploratory development and demonstration under this PRDA is
anticipated at $1.2M over four (4) fiscal years starting in FY01. Offerors
are encouraged to submit one or more white papers that address exploratory
development with demonstrable results. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors
are required to submit (5) copies of a 10 page (or less) white paper with a
cover letter. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN:
James R. Milligan, Reference PRDA-00-09-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTD, 525 Brooks Road,
Rome NY 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A:
Title. Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, Principle Investigator;
Section B: Effort objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must
mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in
FAR 15.609. Also, Small Businesses only should send one (1) copy of the
cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis
Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome
NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement
may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to
preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is
not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent
with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost
proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization
will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation
will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. Evaluation of
proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria,
which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall
scientific and technical merit, including the approach for the development
and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related
Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and
domain knowledge, 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards
are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms
of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed
costs and fees (if any). Options are discouraged and unpriced options will
not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to
this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any
resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable
expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR
31.205-18. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is
excluded at the prime contract level. Data subject to export control
constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor
Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. For further
information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at
1-800-352-3572. The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN
facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel
identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access
to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award. The cutoff date for
submission of white papers is 18 Oct 00 for FY01, 15 Oct 01 for FY02, 15 Oct
02 for FY03 and 15 Oct 03 for FY04. This PRDA is open and effective until
cancelled. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from
offerors or potential offerors for this announcement. Routine questions are
not considered to be significant concerns and should be communicated
directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308. The
purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting
Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues,
disagreement and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.
The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Reid S. Lerum, Lt Col, Chief, AFRL/IFK
at (315) 330-7746. When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict
confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman should only
be contacted with issues or problems that have been previously brought to
the attention of the contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily
resolved at that level. A copy of the AFRL/IFK BAA & PRDA: A Guide for
Industry, Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at:
http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible firms may
submit a white paper which shall be considered. Respondents are asked to
provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their
submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address, and reference
PRDA-00-09-IFKPA. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit
the Government.

BACKGROUND
	The Fishery Sampling Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center oversees the placement of fishery observers on commercial fishing vessels.  The placement of these observers may be required by various federal laws, most notably the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Additionally, the presence of observers is mandated by various fishery management plans (FMP's) and by some Atlantic coastal states' fishery regulations.  The industry, in general, is aware of the program and its function but this understanding does not always extend to the docks and the individual vessels.  The objective of this requirement is to develop materials to educate the industry (at the vessel level) of the program's mission and objectives as well as the authority under which NEFSC operates.  Additionally,  a kiosk display needs to be developed to present at trade shows and fish expo's in order to attain wide dissemination of the program's story to the public and fishing industry.
	
SCOPE OF WORK
	Through consultations with the Fishery Sampling Branch staff at Woods Hole, the contractor shall design and prepare various hand-out materials suitable for presentation to the industry to educate them on the Observer Program's objectives and goals. 

	One document shall cover the basic Observer Program, its development, purpose, and legislative mandates.  This document shall be several pages long and prepared as a brochure.  Other documents shall focus on specific fisheries, and/or specific Fisheries Management Plans that require observers.  This would include, but not be limited to, Gillnet, Trawl, Seine, and Long-line Fisheries.  These documents shall be prepared as one (1) double-sided, laminated document which is suitable for observers to take along on vessels.  These hand-outs shall be directed towards the industry in situations which have not typically had observer coverage or in situations where compliance has been an issue. 

	Excerpts from the handouts shall be consolidated into a traveling kiosk to be used by NMFS at various trade shows and fish expo's along the east coast.

DELIVERABLES AND TIME TABLE

June 1st		Initial meeting between NMFS and vendor to begin discussions to gather information and visuals for preparation of the documents.

August 1st		Draft documents are presented for NMFS review

September 15th	Final versions of documents and the Kiosk are presented
THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO FORWARD AMENDMENT NO. 0001 WHEREIN
THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF OFFERS IS EXTENDED TO 4:30 P.M., 05/28/2002.

<DESC>NA The Broad Agency Announcement DAAB15-02-R-0030, Autonomous Mine Detection Sensors, is being a modified to make corrections in the original announcement.  As a result of these changes:  1) The Government's intent is to hold the demonstration at Fort A.P. Hi ll in late FY 02.  Therefore, the first paragraph of Part III, White Paper Submission, White Paper Content, is changed to read: 'In order to be evaluated for participation in the demonstration to take place at Fort AP Hill in late FY02, vendors are require d to submit a white paper describing the technical capabilities of the proposed technology and the estimated cost for attendance of the demonstration. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort and expense by potential offerors in pre paring a full technical and cost proposal for efforts not considered responsive or for efforts evaluated to have very low overall probability of obtaining support.' 2) The following is included as the second paragraph of Part V, General Information, subpar agraph entitled Subcontracting:  'If a subcontract(s) with a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is proposed, offerors are reminded of the limitations in their use (see FAR 35.017) and must provide documentation in the proposal that wo rk is not otherwise available from the private sector.' And 3) That part of Part III, White Paper Submittal, subparagraph entitled White Paper Due Date and Time reading 'due by 15 June 2002 at 12 noon Eastern Daylight Savings Time' is changed to read: 'due  by 17 June 2002 at 12 noon Eastern Daylight Savings Time'.  A complete revised copy of the BAA is available at the Interagency Business Opportunity Page URL: https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)  is seeking information in the form of capability statements from all interested parties with the capabilities (in one or more of the three (3) technical focus areas described below) to provide OPS technical expertise supporting the Integrity Management Training, Inspections, and Enforcement programs.  All interested persons may statements of qualifications. This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.

BACKGROUND: OPS's integrity management initiative is intended to improve safety and environmental protection and to provide better assurance to the public about the safety of pipelines.  It is based on the culmination of experience OPS has gained from pipeline inspections, accident investigations and risk management and system integrity initiatives.

OPS's first integrity management rule (65 FR 75378), issued on November 2, 2000 and effective on May 29, 2001, applies to hazardous liquid operators who own or operate 500 or more miles of pipeline.  The rule establishes requirements for pipelines that can affect High Consequence Areas (HCA), which include populated areas defined by the Census Bureau as urbanized areas or places, unusually sensitive environmental areas, and commercially navigable waterways.

Between February and April 2002, OPS visited all operators covered by the rule  to evaluate their compliance with the rule's first deadline requiring identification by December 31, 2001, of all pipeline segments that can affect HCAs.  OPS also conducted a preliminary assessment of operators' readiness to comply with the rule's March 31, 2002 deadline to implement an integrity management program.   OPS will begin more comprehensive inspections addressing the March 31 deadline in August 2002.  OPS expects to complete an estimated 40 comprehensive inspections in two years.

SERVICES REQUIRED: To assist OPS in conducting effective comprehensive integrity management inspections, OPS intends to obtain via contract(s) technical expertise on an as-needed basis to support OPS in performing the following: 

	(1)  Development and delivery of training modules, and development of protocols and supplementary guidance, for federal and state inspectors who will conduct the comprehensive inspections.  These materials will assist inspectors in evaluating operators' compliance, including technical bases operators used to identify HCAs, to choose in-line inspection tool or other inspection methodology, to apply remediation criteria and methodology, and to characterize risk abatement due to leak detection systems, valve placement, and control center, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system operation.

	(2) Review of operators' technical bases for deviating from certain regulatory provisions.  The rule allows an operator to deviate from the requirements in three situations, with prior notification to OPS.   Deviations are allowed for: proposed use of technology other than in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing to assess the integrity of line pipe, inability to meet the remediation schedules required by the rule where additional safety cannot be provided by a temporary reduction in pressure, and proposals to use re-assessment intervals longer than 5 years. 

	(3) When requested by OPS, provide technical consultation in areas of technical expertise.  Consultations may be by telephone, by document review, by site visits, or in meetings with pipeline operators.  The number and extent of consultations will vary according to the circumstances involved in the requests.  To accomplish these objectives, OPS is seeking to contract with personnel who have technical expertise and field experience in the following areas: overland spill migration and waterway transport modeling, highly volatile liquid (HVL) dispersion model analysis, metallurgical analysis related to repair criteria, interpretation of pig run data, choice and application of pipeline inspection technologies, control center and SCADA system operation expertise. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS: An interested party must be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with and ability to perform the kind of work described in this notice. OPS may award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required.  Such documentation may include, but not be limited to contracts, both government and commercial, the offeror has performed, references, i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information that documents the offeror's capabilities, e.g. awards, commendations, etc.  Responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE  request must contain the following information: 1) a 3-5 page summary of the contractor's "relevant" prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the proposer may have in performing the work, 3) resumes of key individuals (documenting expertise and field experience in the technical area of interest); 4) A brief description of the contractor's quality control processes for deliverables, 5) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 6) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 7) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 8) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantage business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

Any entity responding to this SOURCES SOUGHT should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the government to determine the entity's qualifications to perform.  Only entities having relevant experience performing this type of requirement will be considered qualified for consideration.  A Government panel will evaluate all submissions for responsiveness to this announcement.  This is a sources sought announcement only.  This is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission to this Sources Sought Announcement nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement. 

Written capability statements must be received no later than May 30, 2002 to: U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (DMA-30), 400 7th Street, S.W., Rm. 7104, Washington, D.C.  20590, Attn: Tom Scott.  Phone (202) 366-4538, E-Mail tom.scott@rspa.dot.gov.   Facsimile or electronic submissions will not be accepted.  All respondents to this notice are urged to send in their capability statements via an express mail service (e.g. UPS, Federal Express).  Please DO NOT send in statements via  regular mail or courier services because of delays that may be encountered due to mail security screening measures and building access security requirements.

<CONTACT>David H. Jones, Contracting Officer, Phone (757) 864-2421, Fax (757) 864-8863, Email D.H.JONES@larc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information for potential sources to provide Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) on or after April 1, 2004 for use in the National Transonic Facility, a research wind tunnel at LaRC (details below).  The following is a description of the facility, NASA's LN2 requirement, and historical usage: The U.S. National Transonic Facility (NTF) is a closed circuit, fan driven cryogenic pressure wind tunnel.  The NTF operates at cryogenic temperatures by injecting LN2 in to the tunnel.  More information about the facility can be found at www.larc.nasa.gov. There are two on-site LN2 storage dewars at the NTF.  The small LN2 storage dewar (built in 1979) can hold 250,000 gallons of LN2 and the large dewar (built in 1997) can hold 900,000 gallons of LN2.  Both dewars are constantly maintained at 5psig and require a minimum liquid LN2 levels of 6% for the small dewar and 2% for the large dewar. The 250,000 gallon dewar is the NTF "Run" tank and provides all LN2 prior to injection into the tunnel.  The NTF can empty this tank at a maximum rate of 9400 gallons per minute (GPM) using three different size LN2 pumps.  The boil-off for this dewar is approximately 0.35%/day.  This dewar is primarily filled by a pipeline coming directly from the 900,000 gallon dewar.  LN2 can be pumped directly from the 900,000 gallon dewar to the 250,000 gallon dewar at a maximum rate of 1250 GPM.  There are also four truck off-loading stations capable of filling the 250,000 gallon dewar at 400 GPM.  Additionally, the 250,000 gallon dewar can receive LN2 directly from a commercial LN2 production facility via an external 3.0 inch ID vacuum jacketed pipeline at a maximum rate of 250 GPM (however, this pipeline typically is used to supply the 900,000 gallon dewar). The 900,000 gallon dewar provides the main LN2 storage for the NTF.  The boil-off for this dewar is also approximately 0.35%/day.  This dewar receives LN2 directly from a commercial LN2 production facility via an external 3.0 inch ID vacuum jacketed pipeline at a maximum rate of 250 GPM. The NTF operations require between 1,500,000 gal/year (~5,000 ton/year) and 20,800,000 gal/year (~70,000 tons/year) of LN2.  The NTF can use over 560,000 gal/day (~2,000 tons/day) during normal operations and therefore can require a replenishment rate up to 240,000 gals/day (810 tons/day) of the on-site dewars to ensure efficient operations of the facility.  The desired operations of the facility are to run continuously for 5 days during cryogenic operations (~20 hrs. per day) and stand down for 5 days to replenish the dewars during the following week.  Not all testing programs require cryogenic operations so there are extended periods throughout the year with significantly reduced LN2 demands.  The minimum quality requirements of LN2 are: 	Purity		99.995% 	Oxygen         &lt; 8 ppm by volume 	Moisture	&lt; 5 ppm by volume 	Particulate	&lt; 10 micrometer nominal and &lt; 40                           micrometer absolute The historical use of LN2 per year at the NTF is shown in Table 1.  The ten-year LN2 usage average is 15,500,000 gallon/year (~52,000 ton/year).          Table 1 - NTF Yearly LN2 Usage 	FY	LN2 Tons	LN2 Gals. 	1991	41,773	       12,386,360 	1992	46,014	       13,643,884 	1993	57,051	       16,916,531 	1994 56,372	       16,715,196 	1995	63,765	       18,907,339 	1996	73,696	       21,852,039 	1997	48,613	       14,414,529 	1998	36,542	       10,835,285 	1999 59,614	       17,676,501 	2000	30,262	        8,973,165 	2001	64,231	       19,045,515 	Average	52,539	       15,578,759 	 A SITE VISIT AT THE NATIONAL TRANSONIC FACILITY WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES ON MAY 30, 2002 AT 10:00 AM.  TO ATTEND YOU MUST PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO d.h.jones@larc.nasa.gov NO LATER THAN NOON ON MAY 28: ·	YOUR FULL NAME ·	THE NAME OF YOUR COMPANY ·	YOUR COUNTRY OF CITIZENSHIP ·	YOUR BUSINESS ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER (Note: You will need to provide a photo ID when you pick up your visitor badge at the NASA Langley badge and pass office.  Please arrive at the badge and pass office no later than 12:30 PM to ensure adequate processing time for your visitor badge.) WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT, ALL INTERESTED SOURCES ARE REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO THE FOLLOWING BY 4:30 PM ON JUNE 6, 2002: 1.	Please indicate whether your firm is a large or small business, using the small business size standard of 1,000 or fewer employees (NAICS Code 325120). 2.	If you answered that you are a small business in question 1 above, also indicate whether you fall into any of the following categories: small disadvantaged business, 8(a) Program participant, small woman-owned business, small veteran-owned business, small service-disabled veteran-owned business, or Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone small business.  Please refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation for definitions of each category. 3.	Please provide brochures or a capability statement that details your experience in providing LN2 in quantities similar to those in NASA Langley's requirement description.  It is requested that any capability statement developed specifically in response to this request be limited to no more than three pages.  There is no page limitation on existing brochures on your firm, but you are requested to limit the submission of such brochures to those that are directly applicable to this requirement.  Please provide four (4) copies of all materials requested in this paragraph. 4.	How long would your firm need from the time of contract award to begin delivering LN2 at the rates specified in NASA's requirement description?  NASA assumes that any potential contractor (other than the incumbent) would have to build an air separation plant adjacent to Langley Research Center in order to meet our requirements.  In the interest of promoting competition, NASA is willing to provide the lead-time needed by a contractor to complete construction and commissioning activities for a production facility. 5.	In your opinion, which type of contract would be more desirable / appropriate for this requirement, an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a guaranteed minimum quantity, or a requirements contract?  If you consider an IDIQ contract to be preferable, what would you consider to be a reasonable minimum quantity?  Assume a contract term of no more than five years and a single guaranteed minimum quantity (as opposed to an annual minimum quantity). 6.	Will the answers to the questions in item 5 above change if the potential term of the contract increases to 10 years?  15 years? 7.	What is the minimum length of contract that would be required to get a proposal from your firm? 8.	How far into the future would you be willing to bid fixed price rates per ton if no economic price adjustment clause is included in the contract?  9.	If an economic price adjustment clause were to be incorporated into the contract, what price index, in your opinion, should be used?  Consider both product (LN2) price indices, if they exist, and price indices related to production costs (e.g., price of electricity or other fuels).  Please be specific, and briefly explain your choice. 10.	What could NASA do to enable your firm to supply LN2 at a lower cost?  (e.g., negotiating terms with the local electric supply company whereby you could buy electricity at the same rates as NASA.)  Please provide as many specific details as possible. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm;   number of employees; ownership; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Questions should be directed to David H. Jones, the Contracting Officer. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to identify potential domestic sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  This notice is neither a solicitation for, nor request for competitive proposals. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a procurement to productize a radiation hardened (Rad Hard) version of an advanced (240-300 MIPS, single chip) commercial microprocessor, in order to meet military requirements.  The Rad Hard version of the commercial microprocessor must be derived from licensed commercial design Intellectual Property to ensure compatibility and reduce risk.  The Rad Hard microprocessor must be able to fully utilize the corresponding commercial microprocessor software infrastructure (i.e. operating systems, compilers, development environments, legacy code, etc.).  Under the authority of the DPA, any potential acquisition is restricted to sources with domestic production capabilities. The principal objectives of this potential project are for the productization and qualification of rad tolerant and rad hard microprocessors at a device feature size of 0.25 mm and 0.18 mm while concurrently working towards achieving independent financial viability by addressing the needs of both government and commercial customers.  The government contemplates that the project will consist of three phases, each lasting approximately 16 months.  Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in the design, development, and domestic production of radiation hardened (greater than or equal to 1 Mrad, greater than or equal to 1E9 rad/s) microprocessors and should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting the information required under note 25 below. All submitted information should be limited to no more than 25 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 12 and should be sent to Sheila Titer, Contract Negotiator, at (937) 255-0405, facsimile (937) 255-5302 or via e-mail at sheila.titer@wpafb.af.mil by 07 Jun 02 at 1500 EST. Submittals via e-mail are preferred. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Strike Task Force (GSTF) Industry Day
<DESC>The AFRL GSTF INDUSTRY DAY will disseminate specifics for a Request for Information (RFI).  It will be held on Wednesday,
26 June 2002 (8 AM to 12 Noon) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (Building 642, Kenney Auditorium). Briefings will be held at the Secret level.  Please send your security clearance information to HQ AFRL/XPA (Attention Major David Agins), 1864 4th Street (Bldg 15), WPAFB OH 45433-7131.  Or you may FAX it to 937-904-7011.  Last day to provide visit requests is 17 Jun 2002. 
The RFI will be asking for input by 27 September 2002 that will provide AFRL with technology, information, weapon system and/or other ideas for enhancing capabilities supporting the Global Strike Task Force (GSTF). AFRL Plans and Programs Directorate (AFRL/XP) is seeking this information to better align technology projects and program investments for the future. This interest extends to system-Ievel and system-of-system concepts. 
Background: Events on September 11, 2001 sparked a call for more rapidly responsive air forces.  US military operations have traditionally relied on deploying superior power close to an adversary in a time-consuming build-up phase before beginning operations. However, potential adversaries are acquiring a wide variety of advanced anti-access systems that threaten to discourage US intervention, disrupt coalitions, or prevent coalition forces from operating from desired locations.  To overcome these threats, the USAF is developing new concepts of operations (CONOPS) that leverage the many recent technological advances in survivability, target acquisition, precision munitions, and a breadth of information technologies. The USAF GSTF concept will leverage current and near term capabilities to overcome theater access threats and rapidly establish air dominance. The GSTF is based on 28 capabilities focused in 6 categories (Strike, Survivability, Force Protection, C31, (Logistics/Combat Support, and Strike Find-Fix-Track-and Target or F2T2). Established air dominance through the GSTF further provides joint aerospace, land, and sea forces the freedom to attack and to be free from attack.

<SUBJECT>A -- Phillips Research Site Support Contractor Administrative Access to Proprietary Data
<DESC>1.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy (DE) and Space Vehicles (VS) Directorates have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require the contractor (Leader Communications, Inc.; major subcontractor:  DataCom Sciences, Inc.) to access for administrative purposes proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  The required access does not involve the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information and will be granted to non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish these administrative tasks.  Examples of the administrative tasks being performed include:

	a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files

	b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel in the DE and VS Directorates

c. Handling and administration of Small Business Innovation Research proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries

d. Attending executive and technical management reviews to collect information for use by Directorate management and technical personnel.

2.  In view of the limited types of administrative access Leader Communications will be granted, DE and VS have obtained a waiver from the regulatory requirement for contractors to execute company-to-company agreements for protection of proprietary information.  Instead, Leader Communications, Inc. will be contractually bound to protect this information and will be further required to protect this information by entering into non-disclosure agreements with its subcontractors and all personnel employed under the contract, as well as with the Government.  Copies of the non-disclosure agreements will be provided to the contracting officer.  Future R&D solicitations and contracts issued for DE and VS will include provisions similar to this notice, advising offerors that Leader Communications will require administrative access to proprietary data and that non-disclosure agreements will be executed.  Contractors with open DE and VS contracts will be individually notified and asked to provide written consent for Leader Communications to obtain administrative access to any proprietary data delivered under their contracts.

<SUBJECT>--JOINT CHEMICAL FIELD TRIALS-II FOR DECONTAMINATION DEVICES/TECHNOLOGIES
<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is sponsoring the Joint Chemical Field Trials-II (JCFT-II) as part of the Contamination Avoidance at Seaports of Debarkation (CASPOD) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). The JCFT-II will be used as the technical test bed to evaluate key performance parameters of selected tec hnologies/devices for possible inclusion in the ACTD. Four commodity areas will be evaluated within the JCFT: Detection, Decontamination, Personal/Collective Protection, and Medical. Each commodity area will be advertised in a separate announcement. This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.  By “mature,” is meant Technology Readiness Level (T RL) Seven or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.  TRL-7 means that a system prototype demonstration has occurred in an operational environment and that the prototype is near or at a planned operational system level.  Your device/technology must offer sign ificantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered for inclusion in CASPOD. The JCFT-II is planned for November 2002 to April 2003 at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah (although actual on-site testing time will likely be less than a few weeks).   The JCFT-II will provide technology developers an opportunity to both demonstrate the ir devices’/technologies’ potential for inclusion in the CASPOD ACTD or future CB defense programs, and obtain unique performance data that can be used in their developmental work.  In addition, technologies/devices participating in the JCFT-II may become visible to a number of U.S. and foreign agencies.  If invited, you must be willing to provide your device/technology and any required on-site support to the JCFT-II at no cost to the government for the JCFT-II.  In return, you will be provided detailed tec hnical test data on your device/technology following the conclusion of all testing.  A desired capability for the CASPOD ACTD is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological contamination on large pieces of equipment or terrain. These systems should use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (tra iler mounts or “slip ins” are acceptable).  Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit without significant loss of effectiveness are needed.  For consideration, potential decon technology providers must:   · Demonstrate decon efficacy against chemical warfare agents.  Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign.    · Demonstrate a preliminary capability to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.    ·Supply information on material compatibility. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided.    ·Supply MSDS's on all products.    ·Supply samples that are representative of the commercial production lot (for the JCFT II testing if requested by the government).    ·Provide evidence of production capability/capacity.    ·Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options    ·Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.    ·Provide the results of operational testing using their product in the decontamination of large pieces of equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, or terrain.    ·Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment and terrain NOTE:  Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc. data. For submissions to be considered as decontaminati on systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Jim Cannaliato, james.cannaliato@sbccom.apgea.army.mil, no later than close of business,  June 14 2002.  Telephonic responses will not be accepted.  The cost of preparing submissions in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting purchase or any other contract. There will be no formal request for proposals or other solicitations regarding this announcemen t. The Government reserves the right to select one, some, or none of the submissions for further investigation. Submissions shall not exceed five (5) 8.5 X 11 inch, single-sided pages per product.  Product MSDS, independent technical reports, and laborator y reports may be attached in an appendix and will not count against the length requirement. Vendors who submit packages for review do so with the understanding that U.S. Government personnel as well as their support contractors will review their literature .  The purpose of this document is to identify potential sources. There is no solicitation document at this time. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded.  Special Notice:  If you have responded to or participated in the Restoration of Operations (RestOps) ACTD and there are no significant improvements to your device/technology, or if you responded to the Broad Agency Announcement 02-Q-4655 “Under Secretary o f Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics [USD (AT&L)] and Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office Technical Support Working Group (TSWG),” which closed at 1600 (4:00 pm) EST 23 Dec 01, you need not respond to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>--CASPOD FIELD TRIALS FOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES
<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is sponsoring the Joint Chemical  Field Trials-II (JCFT-II) as part of the Contamination Avoidance at Seaports of Debarkation (CASPOD) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). The JCFT-II will be used as the technical test bed to evaluate key performance parameters of selected tec hnologies/devices for possible inclusion in the ACTD. Four commodity areas will be evaluated: Detection, Decontamination, Personal/Collective Protection, and Medical. Each commodity area will be advertised in a separate announcement. This announcement is for mature medical technologies and devices.  The word  “mature,” is used to mean Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Seven or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.  TRL-7 means that a system prototype demonstration has occurred in an operational environment and that the prototype is near or at planned operational  system level maturity.  Your device/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military items to be considered for inclusion in CASPOD. Field trials are planned to be held at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT, during the November 2002 to April 2003 period (although actual on-site testing time will likely be less than a few weeks). For some medical items, technical testing may occur elsewhere .  These field trials will provide technology developers an opportunity to both demonstrate their devices'/technologies' potential for inclusion in the CASPOD ACTD or future CB defense programs, and obtain unique performance data that can be used in their developmental work.  In addition, technologies/devices participating in the trials may become visible to a number of U.S. and foreign agencies.   If invited, you must be willing to provide your device/technology and any required on-site support to the trial site at no cost to the government.  In return, you will be provided detailed technical and operational test data on your device/technology follo wing the conclusion of all testing.  The key user needs for medical technologies focus on four medical functional areas: ·	Field expedient medical diagnostics ·	CB patient isolation systems ·	Personnel decontamination (both individual and collective) ·	Skin protection ·	Language translators ·	Collective protection ·	Human remains containment ·	Decontaminable field litters ·	Digital patient records and medical surveillance ·	Field telemedicine, including telecommunications Field expedient medical diagnostics devices are small, preferably hand-held or compact devices capable of detecting chemical or biological agents in human bodily fluids and tissues. Technologies should:  ·	Detect multiple agents (chemical or biological) on one platform ·	Be approved (or approvable) by the FDA for all claims made by the licensee. Approvable means the vendor has written information from the FDA that they have reviewed the product dossier and specifically declared it “approvable”  ·	Not require extensive sample clean up prior to analysis ·	Rapidly analyze samples ·	Be producible using a validated manufacturing process CB patient isolation systems effectively permit isolation of non-ambulatory patients from their external environment. Once isolated, contaminated patients will not cross- contaminate treatment or holding personnel and non-contaminated patients can travel t hrough contaminated areas without risk.  All isolation technologies should: ·	Reliably protect against cross contamination of chemical and biological agents, (including Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Materials (TIC/TIM) as a secondary requirement to CB) ·	Permit advanced trauma and life support to patient, including full body monitoring and drug administration ·	Be decontaminable and re-usable, except for specific consumable components ·	Be of size and weight that enables carriage on standard NATO litters and evacuation platforms and entrance to  collective protection systems Personnel decontamination includes systems individuals can use to decontaminate bare skin in a self- or buddy-aid scenario and systems designed to decontaminate a number of individuals quickly and effectively, such as mass casualty scenarios.  The systems may use wet or dry decontaminants.  For consideration, potential medical decontamination systems must: ·	Have proven decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents in vivo (required) and in vitro (desired).  Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either d omestic or foreign. Efficacy studies should meet Good Laboratory Practices standards or equivalent. ·	Be approved (or approvable) by the U.S. FDA for all claims made by the licensee. Approvable means the vendor has written information from the U.S. FDA that they have reviewed the product dossier and specifically declared it “approvable” for human use. ·	Demonstrate a preliminary capability to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.  ·	Supply information on material compatibility. If data on the system do not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided.  ·	Supply MSDS's on all products.  ·	Supply samples that are representative of the commercial production lot (for the JCFT II testing if requested by the government).  ·	Provide evidence of production capability/capacity.  ·	Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options  ·	Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.  ·	Provide the results of operational testing using their product in the decontamination of large pieces of equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, or terrain.  ·	Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant  The system should consider safely removing the decontaminant from the area of operation such that the decontaminant does not build up to create a hazardous situation.  NOTE:  Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated surety, material compatibility, potency life, shelf life, and other data. In addition, mass casualty decontamination systems must: ·	Use FDA approved decontaminants and meet all specifications above ·	Permit rapid set up time using a small number of people ·	Permit whole body decontamination of both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients  ·	Have sufficient room (under cover) to enable triage, decontamination, and clearing without significant risks of cross contamination ·	Provide a safe operating environment to patients and operators, such as warmed solutions and environmental controls ·	Provide lighting, spacing, and raised platforms sufficient to examine, treat, and monitor patients during decontamination ·	Provide a distinct “hot” line between contaminated and clean areas, including ways to ensure integrity of the line ·	Accommodate use of standard NATO litters Offerors of mass casualty decontamination systems must also describe: ·	Time and personnel required to set-up, test, and operate mass casualty decontamination facility adjacent to hospital or other “cold” zone ·	Number of casualties per hour (ambulatory and non-ambulatory) thoroughly decontaminated and cleared to enter the medical treatment facility or other ‘cold’ zone  ·	Time required to decontaminate and clear ambulatory patient. ·	Time required to decontaminate and clear non-ambulatory patient. Language translators are small hand held devices that permit medical personnel to communicate (i.e., speak and hear) in foreign languages.  These devices will enable first responders and medical care providers to acquire and provide medical information nec essary to triage, diagnose and treat non-English speaking casualties.  Language translations technologies should;  ·	Have at least 1000 phrases each in multiple languages, including those used in the Middle East  ·	Detect the task specific medical operations, but also have a full contingent of generic phrases (e.g., greetings, date and time questions, and answers and questions)  ·	Be audio based, but supplemented with written language capabilities  ·	Have capability to interface with external loud speaker systems  ·	Produce a clearly human voice with inflection, rhythm and accent versus machine voice  ·	Operate on standard batteries (rechargeable preferred)  ·	Not weigh more than 20 ounces with batteries installed and small enough to fit comfortably in one hand ·	Be capable with USDII / COE standards  Skin protection technologies are FDA approved medical products that can be applied by individuals before CB attack and provide protection against dermal absorption of hazardous liquid, solid, or gaseous agents. Skin protectants: ·	Have proven efficacy on the skin for over 8 hours following a single application ·	Provide effective barrier protection (i.e., significantly reduce percutaneous absorption through intact skin) for at least 4 hours of constant contact with agent ·	Protect against sulfur mustard, thickened soman, sarin, VX and T2 toxin ·	Can be applied to vulnerable areas of the body, e.g., face and neck, groin area, and areas where over garments seam with gloves, boots, and at waistline. ·	Effective when used with standard military protective clothing and equipment ·	Stable in formulation and when stored in hot, cold, wet, and dry environments without special holding equipment Medical Collective Protection systems will offer users collective protection equipment, such as easily erected shelters, having sufficient space for at least 40 patients and requisite medical staff.

<SUBJECT>--REMOTELY-ACTIVATED MARKING SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE RESTORATION OF OPERATIONS (RESTOPS) ADVANCED CONCEPT TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION (ACTD)
<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is in the final year of executing the RestOps ACTD.  Technologies for decontamination, detection, medical, protection and situational awareness have been selected for inclusion in the 2QFY03 Final Demonstration at  Osan Air Base, Korea.   However, a user need not yet addressed is that of “Trans-Zone Marking,” as a subset of protection and situational awareness, by which is meant signage used to denote the boundary between two areas of potentially different chemical warfare contamination risk.  Persons transitioning from one zone to another that is at a different chemical warfare risk will be required to change their Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) protective posture; i.e., don/doff suit components and mask  ensemble in accordance with the contamination designation of the zone.  We are seeking mature COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) or NDI (non-developmental item) technology to meet this need.  The basic need is for portable (preferably less than 50 pounds), r emotely-activated signs which can display three conditions, for example: RED, denoting the boundary between MOPP-4 (highest level of protection), YELLOW for MOPP-2 (intermediate level of protection), and GREEN, no MOPP required.  In lieu of colors, signage  with selectable text messages such as “Boundary to MOPP-4 Zone” would be acceptable.  The proposed solution needs to: ·	include a photograph of the system.  ·	include a description of the device to include all technical characteristics and capabilities ·	be simple to emplace,  ·	be collapsible,  ·	be sturdy enough to withstand moderate wind and other outdoor meteorological conditions (rain, sleet, snow, temperature ranging from below zero to approximately 100-deg F),  ·	have Global Positioning System on-board for location data,  ·	be remotely operable by wireless means, and  ·	have a sustainable on-board power source for at least 12 hours continuous operation (i.e., solar-charged batteries would be acceptable), and able to be powered by V19 generator. ·	include cost and lead time for purchase of the item in both small (less than 10) and larger quantities (10 –50) Since approximately 45 “trans-zone” locations have been identified at Osan the proposed solution also needs to be as inexpensive as possible.  For purposes of the 2QFY03 demonstration at Osan, a limited number (fewer than 10) devices are being sought to ve rify and validate the concept.  Subsequent to this demonstration, the user will determine if the military utility warrants the purchase of additional items for Osan and potentially for other Air Force installations.  In addition, DTRA is also executing the  Contamination Avoidance at Sea Ports of Debarkation (CASPOD) ACTD which may also identify a need for trans-zone marking devices with similar or identical specifications.  For submissions to be considered developers/vendors must electronically supply the p receding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Jim Cannaliato, james.cannaliato@sbccom.apgea.army.mil, no later than close of business June 14 2002.  Telephonic responses will not be accepted.  The cost of preparing submissions in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting purchase or any other contract.
