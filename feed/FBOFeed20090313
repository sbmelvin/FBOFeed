<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) currently has two general support systems (GSSs) supporting the computer applications of the agency and six major applications (MAs).  The two GSSs are designated as the “Local Area Network/Personal Computers” (LAN/PC) and the “Mainframe Computer Data Processing” systems.  The six MAs are the RR Employees Compensation and Service, Financial Interchange, RRA Payments, RUIA Payments, Medicare, and Financial Management systems.  Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance provided in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, both GSSs and all six MAs have been categorized as having the moderate level of risk for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Both GSSs and five of the MAs have been certified and accredited. The Financial Management application is currently undergoing the certification and accreditation (C&A) process.  

The RRB seeks contractual assistance to develop and implement a continuous monitoring program in compliance with NIST standards and to consolidate existing documentation for four related MAs, RR Employees Compensation and Service, RRA Payments, RUIA Payments, and Medicare into one system entitled Benefit and Payment Operations.  Optionally, the contractor may be called upon to produce policy/procedure documents for the RRB’s review and approval and to perform re-certification and accreditation processes for various RRB general support systems and major applications.

Potential offerors should submit their letter of interest to Velinda.nix@rrb.gov.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Sapko Consulting Services (LLC) for the Report of Investigations (RI) to "Present the results of full-scale dust explosion tests that were conducted at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) to determine the amount of rock dust necessary to inert this finer size of coal dust". Assist Disaster Prevention and Response Branch (DPRB) in writing Part II of the NIOSH RI titled "Rock Dust Inerting Requirements in U.S. Coal Mines, Part II- LLEM Research on the Effects of Coal Particle Size on Rock Dust Inerting Requirements." Due to the highly influential nature of these results, this document will not only be sent out for technical review to a peer-review panel, but will also be placed on the NIOSH website for open review. Assist DPRB personnel in responding to all comments from the peer-review panel and from all outside reviewers. Assist in rewriting manuscript to incorporate these comments.
<p>Mike Sapko, principal of Sapko Consulting Services (LLC), is an internationally recognized authority in the area of hazards of fire, explosions and explosive safety and instrumentation to improve coal mine health and safety. His research work on laboratory and large-scale dust and gas explosions provides the background to provide meaningful input concerning inerting levels for coal mine dusts and to identify operational issues associated with measuring such levels. He also has considerable experience in developing alternative test methods for evaluating mine seals. This, coupled with prior work with the measurement and behavior of explosive atmospheres, contributes to considering him a valuable asset for understanding the risks of maintaining such an atmosphere in a sealed area.</p>
<p>The generalized knowledge of the issues surrounding dust and gas explosions, the specific experience of Sapko Consulting Services (LLC) with NIOSH full-scale test facilities will improve the interpretation of data obtained from such facilities and will eliminate the need to educate an individual on the specifics of the facilities' operations. This experience will be critical to the successful and timely completion of these tasks.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to James Ambrozic, Purchasing Agent, Reference <br />000HCCMBG-2009-68041, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070.

Quincy St. Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22206, phone (703) 416-3222, fax (703) 416-8408 from 0800 to 1300.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the GATE program, promote additional discussion on this topic, and address questions from potential proposers.  The first session of the proposer's day will be held at the unclassified level and is for all proposers. The second session, immediately following the first session, will be held at the SECRET level and will address the classified aspects of the BAA. 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  
The GATE Program will expand our ability to thwart both underground infiltration of secure perimeters and tactical underground operations.  The specific goal of the program is to develop a prototype gravity gradiometer airborne system which significantly increases our capability to detect, classify, and characterize these subterranean tactical threats by their anomalous gravity signature.     
REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  
Proposers requesting to attend should submit their name, organization, and which sessions they desire to attend via email to the BAA administrative POC (email: DARPA-BAA-09-20) by 4:00 PM local time in Arlington, VA, on  10 April 2009. In addition, proposers requesting to stay for the classified session should submit a visitor request to Analytic Services, Inc.  Visitor clearance information may be passed by Visit Notification through JPAS. The SMO code for Analytic Services Inc. is 4A4584. Alternatively, individual visit requests may be forwarded to Analytic Services Inc. Conference Center staff at Analytic Services Inc., Attn: Conference Center, 2900 S. Quincy St., Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22206). The name of the meeting is GATE Proposers Day. The fax number for visit requests is 703-416-8408.
There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  

After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with Dr. Joseph Durek, Program Manager.  Please contact the BAA Coordinator at email DARPA-BAA-09-20@darpa.mil to schedule an individual session.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to increase persistent coverage over a large urban terrain by extending the tracking capabilities of existing radar sensor architectures beyond line-of-sight (LOS) using both multipath energy that represents nuisance signals for current radar system and knowledge of the urban scattering surfaces. 

The ability of current radar sensors to engage and persistently track targets in urban environments is limited by Line-of-Sight (LOS) blockage due to buildings.  This forces the sensors to very high aspect angles to avoid shadows, thus incurring a significant reduction in the coverage area the radars can persistently monitor.  Sensor architectures that are dependent on LOS propagation can only maintain persistent area coverage in a topography-rich urban terrain by dramatically increasing the number of sensors so that any area has a LOS view to at least one sensor.  For a ground-based system, sensors may be required for every street necessitating hundreds or thousands of sensors to fully cover a metropolitan area.  Airborne system coverage may be limited to a few kilometers of range, requiring scores of aircraft for persistent coverage over a metropolitan area.  The cost of wide area persistent surveillance is dominated by platform logistics and support, so this type of coverage would be prohibitively expensive.  

While objects such as buildings cast large RF shadows in urban environments, much of the radar energy blocked by buildings is actually reflected back into the street below.  This multipath energy illuminates the urban environment within the LOS shadows and provides an opportunity to greatly extend the persistent area coverage of an airborne radar sensor.

PROPOSERS DAY
A Proposer's Day will be held on 17 April 2009 at 8:00 AM at Analytic Services Inc., Conference Center, 2900 S. Quincy St. Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22206, phone (703)416-3222, fax (703) 416-8408.  This meeting will be held at the unclassified level.  Proposers wishing to attend should submit their name and organization via email to the BAA Coordinator prior to 30 March 2009.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal(RFP) for the development of a conceptual telescope design to meet the requirements ofthe Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is a jointly funded and developed missionby NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) and is a space-based, medium aperture, widefield, optical telescope with visible and near-infrared (NIR) imaging and spectroscopicinstrumentation.  JDEM will survey the sky to accurately measure the magnitude andredshift of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), spectroscopic redshifts of alarge, uniform sample of galaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) studies, andaccurate shape parameters and photometric redshift measurements of a very large sample ofgalaxies for Weak Lensing (WL) studies.  The Telescope Assembly portion of theobservatory is expected to be an afocal Three Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) with 3 tertiarymirrors that will provide the optical train to the Government developed JDEM instruments(4 focal planes and a fine guidance sensor).  The JDEM telescope is expected to have aprimary mirror size of ~1.5 meters in diameter and operate at a temperature of 253Kelvin.  The JDEM observatory is expected to be launched aboard a NASA provided EELV inlate 2015 to an orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange point (L2) and be operated fora minimum of 5 years.  NASA contemplates evaluating and selecting multiple offers(approximately 3) based on the proposals as submitted and providing each of the studyparticipants a not to exceed cost of $300K for a three month study.    This studyactivity is intended to determine feasible telescope concepts based on the preliminaryJDEM science requirements, assess the critical cost and schedule drivers, and developcost and schedule estimates for the design, build and test of the JDEM telescope. Requirements for a collimated beam at the instruments pupils will be provided and aconceptual telescope design will be developed in the course of this study.  The studywill also request results of trade studies performed in the course of the study, arecommendation on the level of integrated modeling required for the proposed concept, adescription of the telescope integration and test flow along with a recommended opticaltest approach at temperature.  Additionally, the study will request an alternativeconcept for the entire optical system be developed from the primary mirror through theinstrument optics given a set of requirements on the instrument focal planes.  It isanticipated that in the near future the information relative to this concept study, willbe posted to the JDEM website at http://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov    .The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about Monday, January 5, 2009 with ananticipated offer due date of on or about Thursday, February 5, 2009.An ombudsman has been appointed.The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Oxford Instruments America, Inc, for the repair of Repair of NIST’s Oxford Teslatron Cryostat.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Quantum Electrical Metrology Division at NIST uses an Oxford Teslatron Cryostat for low-temperature quantum Hall measurements.  An assessment of the instrument’s magnet has found a resistive section at the point of the joint in the second section of windings in the Niobium Tin coil.  Oxford Instruments is the original equipment manufacturer and has proprietary drawings of the cryostat.  Therefore, Oxford Instruments is the only known vendor capable of providing the repair services without incurring damages to the magnet.  Oxford Instrument, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the instrument that is required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $6,500,000.

<p>3.  To be able to provide relevant recommendations and guidance to the DRP and the CCR the contractor needs to have experience in the direction and management of large research programs, including recruitment of PIs and other personnel, development of their research programs and careers, analysis and development of operating budgets, development of research goals and creation and implementation of strategic plans to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>4.  Because the DRP sponsors different types of meetings the contractor needs experience in the organization of major international scientific meetings.</p>
<p>5.  To help judge the success of the individual research programs in the DRP, and the overall progress made by the program, the contractor needs experience in oversight and review of scientific programs in the NCI and elsewhere.</p>
<p>6.  Because the contactor will represent the DRP to the international AIDS research community, he/she needs sufficient international recognition and respect in the HIV/AIDS field to be able to communicate effectively with senior leaders within the NIH and elsewhere regarding collaboration, participation in scientific meetings, requests for advice, and the like.</p>
<p>7.  At least 20 years of postdoctoral experience and currently holding a senior position, equivalent to full Professor or Senior Scientist; extensive knowledge in the fields of retroviruses, HIV, and AIDS, as evidenced by more than 50 publications in these areas in peer-reviewed journals, as well awards and honors, and invitations to address national and international audiences.</p>

<p>12.  The contractor shall be able to provide a single individual for the project as to maintain continuity.</p>
<p><br />Tufts University can provide extensive and unique experience in the areas of AIDS research and in the organization and function of the NCI AIDS Program. They have an active world-class program in AIDS/HIV including many researchers with strong international reputations. Importantly, from 1997 to 2005, Tufts provided contractual services, in the form of an interagency personnel agreement, to support Dr. John Coffin to assist in establishing and to lead the HIV Drug Resistance Program of the Center for Cancer Research, NCI.  They also have successful experience building world-class AIDS research program within their institution, leading to publish of over 150 publications in retrovirus and HIV research. Tufts was recently received a  Merit Award for their retrovirus research program  as one of the most outstanding NCI-supported research programs in the country.  Therefore, Tufts clearly has a unique experience and capability to provide the required services - both management and research support. No other source is known that combines both the knowledge and experience necessary capable of providing support and guidance on the scientific and administrative issues necessary to the management and operation of a world-class HIV/AIDS program and the thorough knowledge of the HIV/AIDS Programs and research underway at the CCR, NCI.  In addition, Tufts has been the contactor since February 2006 and has been providing recommendations for consideration by NCI scientific leadership for the future direction of HIV/AIDS Research within NCI. The continuity and momentum of ongoing planning and implementation for program activities would be negatively impacted if a new contractor was selected at this point in time.</p>
<p>In addition a Sources Sought Notice was issued, SS-NCI-90001-MM, and no other qualified small businesses capable of providing the requested services were found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sea Bird Electronics Incorporated (SBE), 1808 136th Place NE, Bellevue, Washington for the acquisition of four (4) 19-plus V2 Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Optics-Ready Profilers.  The CTD systems being acquired are urgently needed to support mission essential operations aboard MCM Class ships supporting Mine Warfare (MIW) operations.  Because optical mine hunting systems are migrating to the fleet, the U. S. Navy has an immediate need to increase their optics/CTD sensor package deployments on military platforms.  These sensors provide data in support of other sensors used for oceanography, hydrography, ASW, home land security, MIW, Naval Special Warfare, and many other mission related tasks.  There are no other contractors other than Sea Bird that can provide a CTD that meets all of the U.S. Navy requirements.  Any changes to these requirements would adversely im! pact the mission of the AN/SQH-4B system onboard the MCM Class of ship and support to the MIW community.  Additionally, NAVOCEANO, a partner to NSWC PCD in the mission of environmental data collection and usage already has an enormous inventory of the same/similar Sea Bird sensors being purchased in this contract.    Changing vendors or instrumentation would call for a significant increase in funding to re-engineer current CTD/optics systems and provide logistics support for multiple varieties of probes.  This would also require additional maintenance dollars and training programs to ensure accurate data collection and database population.  Sea Bird has the required expertise to provide necessary calibrations and repairs to these COTS units.  NAICS Code:  334519, Size Standard:  500 Employees,FSC:	6040

<DESC>SAQMMA09R0164 - Worldwide A/E Services - Small Business


The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts for Architect/Engineer (A/E) services in each of the following four small business categories: 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business. The Government anticipates awarding four contracts if a sufficient number of qualified contractors respond for each category.

The business shall be a professionally licensed architectural firm providing architectural and engineering services for new construction projects, project planning, facility renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and system replacement projects, physical and technical security upgrades, and the construction and renovation of post communications centers at US diplomatic foreign service posts worldwide. The applicable NAICS code is 541310.  At least fifty percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. The estimated cost of construction for projects design under the award IDIQ contracts is not expected to exceed, but is not limited to, $10 million. Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work. Involvement in such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in competitively-sourced follow-on work or design-build teams for that project. 

Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $100,000 in task orders over the life of the contract.  The total amount of orders issued under this contract shall not exceed $5,000,000, over the life of the contract.  

The contract will be for professional services to include, but not be limited to, facility assessments and architectural and engineering studies, site utilization studies and master planning, conceptual, preliminary and schematic designs, design development, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates and budget assessments, as well as life-cycle analysis, quality assurance reviews of the work of other A/E firms, research and development studies, value engineering studies or reviews, support services, and construction phase services and claims analysis services.  

Contract services may include the following: architecture, historic preservation, landscape architecture, long range planning, master planning, initial and detailed planning, space planning, site utilization, cost estimating, budget assessment, interior design, food service design, scheduling, and environmental and sustainability design.  In addition, the following engineering disciplines shall be provided: electrical, mechanical, structural, blast, civil, geotechnical, environmental, seismic, security, lighting, acoustical, chemical and biological protection, information and telecommunication, fire protection, value engineering, and vertical transportation.  The administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved, and ascertaining and working within the U.S. Government’s requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards at the overseas project sites shall be required.  Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Knowledge and experience in the preparation of planning, design and construction documents employing alternative methods (e.g. design-bid-build, bridging, and design-build) is required.  Design documents shall utilize AutoCAD 2005 or greater and shall be classified in accordance with the Security Classification Guide for the Design and Construction of Overseas Facilities, dated May 21, 2003. Please indicate if you have Building Information Modeling (BIM) experience and provide project examples listing BIM software experience. 

In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offeror must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DoS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Subcontractors requiring access to classified information or CAA spaces must also possess a Secret FCL.  Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their proposal. If a selected offeror does not possess an interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of six calendar months from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the uncleared firm to obtain the necessary FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding fewer contracts.  Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL and personnel security clearance requirements.  Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture.   

Firms shall be evaluated on the basis of their personnel and experience.  Experience on projects comparable to those of the Department of State shall be considered.  Subcontractor firms shall be included in the qualification package, but the evaluation will not be based on their qualifications.  

Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date will be considered for selection using the following evaluation criteria and based on demonstrated expertise and experience in the following areas: - 100 points maximum:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><BR>This is the second BAA issued for this research topic from the Army Research Office and is valid throughout the period from the date of issuance through 31 July 2009.  This announcement is equivalent to the Initial announcement, W911NF-08-R-0011 issued in July 2008.  Innovative solutions are sought for the Coherent Superconducting Qubits Program within the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).  The Program is envisioned to begin May 1, 2009 and end by June 1, 2014. The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) and IARPA will conduct this BAA in close partnership.  This BAA solicits proposals that will lead to substantially extended coherence times in superconducting qubits. If offerors elect to submit a white paper, it must be prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in PART IV. Section B.1. of the BAA.  Upon receipt, a white paper will be evaluated and the offeror shall be advised of the evaluation results.  Offerors whose white papers receive a favorable evaluation will be contacted and encouraged to prepare a complete proposal in accordance with instructions contained in PART IV Section B.2.  White papers must be transmitted to the following e-mail address: tr.govindan@us.army.mil.  The e-mail subject line should contain the following:  W911NF-09-R-0007 Proposal White Paper. Two Levels of proposals are sought, with particular interest in application to the phase qubit:  Level I proposals will seek to accomplish all of the following Program Goals: (1) fundamental understanding and insights into defects in superconducting qubits that currently limit coherence time and readout contrast; (2) means to characterize, measure and definitively discriminate between these separate defects; and (3) advanced materials, constructions and fabrication methods to eliminate these defects. Level II proposals will seek to accomplish Level I goals as well as the following additional Program Goal: (4) demonstrate substantially extended coherence times in superconducting qubits fabricated from foregoing developments.  Proposals identified for negotiation may result in a contract or an assistance agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.   Technical point of contact for this BAA is Dr. T.R. Govindan, Physics Division, (919) 549-4236, email: tr.govindan@us.army.mil.

This Acquisition shall be competed as UNRESTRICTED.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  An unrestricted solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $370 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Unrestricted within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $100 Thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<BR><BR>There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>For all large businesses proposing under the unrestricted procurement, which requires submission of a subcontracting plan, the Government will require at least 25% of the total dollars that will be awarded to them over the life of the MATOC to be subcontracted.  Then, the subcontracting goals set forth in the solicitation and resulting contract will apply to those subcontracted dollars.<BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

This Acquisition shall be competed as UNRESTRICTED.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  An unrestricted solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Small Business within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $20 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 Thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<BR><BR>There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<BR><BR>There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of BioWrite Retractable Pens to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-03-13
<RESPDATE>032709
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of BioWrite Retractable Pens by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2033 Ballpoint, Black, Fine, Low Viscosity Ink<br />7520-00-NIB-2034 Ballpoint, Black, Medium, Low Viscosity Ink<br />7520-00-NIB-2035 Ballpoint, Blue, Fine, Low Viscosity Ink<br />7520-00-NIB-2036 Ballpoint, Blue, Medium, Low Viscosity Ink<br />7520-00-NIB-2038 Pen with Rubber Grip, Retractable, Biobased &amp; Biodegradable<br />7520-00-NIB-2040 Pen with Rubber Grip, Retractable, Biobased &amp; Biodegradable<br />7520-00-NIB-2037 Pen with Rubber Grip, Retractable, Biobased &amp; Biodegradable<br />7520-00-NIB-2039 Pen with Rubber Grip, Retractable, Biobased &amp; Biodegradable</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing BioWrite Retractable Pens to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2033 None</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2034 BIC-CSM11-BK<br /><br />7520-00-NIB-2035 None<br /><br />7520-00-NIB-2036 BIC-CSM11-BE<br /><br />7520-00-NIB-2038 BIC-BP11BK<br />ITA-30025<br />PAP-70736<br />PIL-32370<br />PIL-32373<br />ZEB-22510<br />ZEB-23410<br />PEN-BK93-A</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2040 BIC-BP11BE<br />ITA-30026<br />PAP-70737<br />PIL-32371<br />ZEB-22520<br />ZEB-23420<br />EN-BK93-C</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2037 PAP-70739<br />ZEB-43410</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2039 PAP-70740<br />ZEB-43420</p>
<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing BioWrite Retractable Pens to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 13, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurement to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  In accordance with FAR 6.303-1 and FAC 2005-30, this special notice announcement provides the Justification and Approval Documents for Noncompetitve Contracts.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, requires continued support for implementation of cooperative moose management plans in Interior Alaska.  Specifically, this project supports implementation of the Yukon Flats Cooperative Moose Management Plan (YFCMMP), which was endorsed by the Federal Subsistence Board in May 2002.  The main purpose of the YFCMMP is to increase the moose population on Yukon Flats.  The village of Beaver has a Tribal Wildlife Grant (TWG) which is intended to help implement the YFCMMP. The Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments (CATG) has a funding agreement with the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge (YFNWR) that, among other things, provides for obtaining subsistence moose harvest information for villages on Yukon Flats.  On July 31 and August 1, 2008, the village of Beaver conducted a meeting as part of its TWG project for the purpose of better organizing and implementing cooperative moose management programs. Two of the action items that resulted from this meeting are to (1) form a Yukon Flats Moose Management Steering Committee (YFMMST) and (2) collaborate to improve subsistence harvest survey methods.  This project supports the cooperative efforts of the village of Beaver, CATG, YFNWR, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) to develop and implement strategies to increase the moose population on Yukon Flats.  Project funds will cover ADF&G staff travel costs involved with participating in the YFMMST and printing and mailing two issues of a Yukon Flats moose management newsletter or other public information and educational materials.  Project funds also support subsistence use data analysis by the ADF&G, Division of Subsistence, Information Management Unit. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy the agency's requirements as this is a continuing effort project with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Village of Beaver, Alaska..
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intended to accept proposals received. Award will be made 15 days after publication of this notice. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to Total Site Solutions.  Total Site Solution (TSS) is currently under contract with the SEC to provide adequate power for the SEC-Chicago data center room located on the 9th floor at 175 West Jackson. The existing contract includes all facilities construction and building improvements required to support the computer room upgrade for standardization.  The additional work covered by this notice includes installation of a 20kW UPS system with racks and ISX488995-023 hardware in the computer room.  To have continuity of services and to assure schedule integrity, it is essential that TSS install the additional work simultaneously with the original work which allows:  (1) both systems to be installed at the same time; (2) the SEC to save time and administrative cost by using the same building permit; (3) the SEC to utilize the same set of approved building plans to complete the project in its entirety; (4) the work is to be performed in a confined area which would restrict and possibly confuse work performed by multiple contractors.  The period of performance shall be through the completion of the project.  The SEC intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.  This is a Notice of Intent, not a solicitation.  No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a noncompetitive contract to Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) for an Annual Copyright License.  Copyright Clearance Center (as the Reproduction Rights Organization for the U.S.) is the only organization that provides this type of broad coverage license for copyright compliance.

This purchase will be made as an Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The anticipated award date is 13 APR 09. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

The justification for this sole source procurement is to continue mission support by utilizing this service for compliance with all U.S. copyright laws.  The Annual Copyright License 
enables Government employees to lawfully reproduce excerpts from the titles in CCC's repository, in print and digital formats; cover information reuse and distribution within the Department by all U.S.-based employees; use CCC's multinational licenses for employees based outside the U.S., and; reduce the burden of tracking and managing content use throughout the Department and simplify the royalty payment process.  This will lessen the cost and burden to the Government by allowing the Department to make a single, annual payment to CCC instead of obtaining individual permissions to numerous publishers for each work used.

The Government has researched this requirement and found that Copyright Clearance Center is the only organization providing this service in the U.S.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the United States Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA 01760 5011, on behalf of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis with Applied Biosystems, 301 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT., 06851-1070, to provide 1600 units of dNTP Blend (12.5Mm daTP, Dgrp, dCTPm 25Mm dUTP) and 100 units of AmpliTaq Gold Buffer A Pack. These items are required together as a component of assay reagents being produced for biological defense application. The requested dNTP Blend and AmpliTaq Gold Buffer A Pack combination will enable NMRC to continue the detection and identification of biological warfare agents. Legacy research via the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, was being conducted for testing of a commercial item via contract N00168-08-P-1565 and as provided for under FAR 13.5, which was dNTP Blend and AMpliTaq Gold Buffer A Pack.  In order to continue this research with the exact formulations and conditions (and reduce the probability of introducing unnecessary variables), there is a need to replenish the supply of dNTP Blend and AMpliTaq Gold Buffer A Pack from the same source, Applied Biosystems.  This research involving reagents development included extensive testing of various reagent components to produce the best combination.  The dNTP Blend and the AmpliTaq Gold Buffer A Pack produced by Applied Biosystems is one of the components. Switching to another kit from another vendor would invalidate all previous optimization and evaluation efforts. Reagents produced with another vendors kit without re-optimization and evaluation would result in unpredictable performance of the reagents, and, would be devastating to program in terms of both cost and schedule. Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available. Any questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. John Conlin, or by email to: john.conlin3@us.army.mil.

These airflow restrictors will be used to allow the Fresh Air Damper Device (FAD) NSN 4130-01-541-2426 to be fully operational with the Armys Fan Filter Assembly Device. PDA is the original developer of the FAD. When the FAD was initially developed, the Fan Filter Assembly Device was not adopted for use by the Army.  The Army used a different device that did not require restriction of airflow. However, the Army has made a determination to use the Fan Filter Assembly Device, which requires an airflow restrictor to have the FAD operate properly. As the original designer of the Fresh Air Damper Device, PDA has professional expertise and knowledge of the FAD as well as the air flow CFD software models developed to model and simulate airflow through M28 Motor Blower Device and the Fan Filter Assembly Device.  These engineering CFD models allowed PDA to successfully model a Fresh Air Damper when used in line with the M28 Motor Blowers, subsequent CFD modeling and simulation indicated a need for airflow restrictor device for the Fan Filter Assembly. Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">United States Army Garrison at West Point - Village of Highland Falls, New York</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Approximately 246 (+/-) acres of underutilized land at the United States Army Garrison (USAG WP) at West Point are being made available for an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) project. Divided into two separate but generally contiguous parcels of 196 acres and 50 acres, roughly, the site lies approximately 1.9 miles south of the USMA main gate. Both parcels A &amp; B are within the boundaries of the Village of Highland Falls, New York. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Parcels A and B are heavily wooded, with some steep topography and bedrock outcroppings, including along Route 9W. Surrounding uses include Morgan Farms equestrian center and a capped landfill immediately to the northwest of Parcel A, and O'Neill High School, which lies between a portion of Parcel A and Route 9W on the east. None of these uses are included in the site. No structures exist on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The site currently has limited access, with one access point via the Main Street/218 exit off Route 9W. This road also provides access to O'Neill High School and the Morgan Farms equestrian center. The road is paved up to the capped landfill, where it becomes gravel. The gravel road continues along the western boundary of the larger site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Utilities are to be provided by the Village of Highland Falls. Water, wastewater, and electricity take-off points exist across 9W from the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">USAG WP is working with the Village of Highland Falls to produce a development that is a benefit to the community. As such, the final land use and development plan for this EUL project will be subject to all review and approvals applicable to a private development project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The USAG at West Point seeks to competitively select a private developer to lease parcels of land to develop age-restricted senior housing under EUL authority. The successful private sector bidder(s) will develop, operate, and maintain the facilities and provide in-kind consideration to the USAG West Point at least equal to the fair market value of the leased assets. The USAG West Point expects the selected developer to actively engage all stakeholders, especially the Village of Highland Falls, in the design and permitting of the development. Age-restricted senior housing as a concept is supported by the Village and the Town of Highland Falls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">An Industry Forum will be held on Wednesday, April 22, 2009, registration information, as well as the Draft Notice of Opportunity to Lease (NOL) and other project information can be found at <a href="http://eul.army.mil/Westpoint/">http://eul.army.mil/Westpoint/</a>.</span></p>

Fort Knox is located approximately 38 miles south of Louisville and 15 miles north of Elizabethtown, in Hardin, Meade, and Bullitt counties. Each of the proposed sites is in a census tract qualified as possibly being eligible for New Market Tax Credit project financing. The census tract qualifies by being in a high migration rural county, which may make the project more attractive to NMTC financiers. </span></p>

Incoming personnel are more highly paid than the outgoing personnel; approximately $100 million more annually in civilian payrolls will be coming to Fort Knox. </span></p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items Jan 1999<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(See Addendum below)<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. <br />(2) Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees and Surcharges. The Offeror shall charge the Government only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are lawfully imposed, or permitted, and that the Offeror is allowed to receive recompense from, or by, the Government.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA DCA200-97-H-0049 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p><br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</p>
<p><br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</p>
<p><br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).</p>
<p><br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</p>
<p><br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</p>
<p><br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</p>
<p><br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.</p>
<p><br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</p>
<p><br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</p>
<p><br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br /><br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</p>
<p><br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</p>
<p><br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ)

The Government’s period of performance is June 1, 2009 – August 10, 2009.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a firm- fixed price purchase order for a contractor to produce 40 German cockroach specific scFvs, 40 Neurospora crassa specific scFvs and 40 Nicotiana specific scFvs. The Statement of Work is as follows: 


I.  Purpose

The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is seeking a contractor to
produce 40 German cockroach specific scFvs, 40 Neurospora crassa specific scFvs and
40 Nicotiana specific scFvs. This work will be done as part of the development of the
multiplex allergen extract potency assay (MAPA). The purpose of MAPA is to assess the
overall potency of complex allergen mixtures. CBER is currently in the process of
developing and optimizing MAPA for less complex allergen mixtures and are ready to
move into more complex mixtures such as the cockroach allergen extract. The
development of this assay will be an important step towards analyzing the allergenicity of
cockroach extract as well as many other extracts currently on the market that do not have
a standard of potency. We are also working with DARPA to evaluate potential allergens
that may exist and copurify with vaccines produced in these novel systems. A human
scFv library used to screen these extracts will be expected to enable us to find relevant
human allergens.

II. Scope of Work

A. TASKS – We would like the following services performed.
1. Phage display screening (4 cycles) of human recombinant library (scFv)
2. Characterization of 40 selected binders by ELISA

B. DELIVERABLES
I. ELISA results from biopanning cycle 4 submitted in Excel
spreadsheet.
DUE: June 1, 2009
II. ELISA of each of the 40 positive clones
DUE: July 1, 2009
III. Sequence of all ELISA positive clones
DUE: August 1, 2009
III. Plasmids of each of the 40 positive clones and library of plasmids
obtained from screen
DUE: August 1, 2009
IV. Written report of the study in Word format
DUE: August 10, 2009

2052.209-72 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JAN 1993)
(a)  Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor:
(1)  Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and
(2)  Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
 
 (b)  Scope.  The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.
 
(c)  Work for others.
 (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause.  If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.
(2)  The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
(3)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract)
(4)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
 (i)  The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.
 
 (ii)  The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
 
(iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.
 
(d)  Disclosure after award.
 
(1)  The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.
 
(2)  The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer.  This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.  The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.
 
(3)  It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.  Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract.  Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site.  This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer.  The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity.  NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.
 
(e)  Access to and use of information.
 
(1)  If in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:
 
(i)  Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;
 
 ii)  Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;
 
(iii)  Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to the public; or
 
(iv)  Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been released to the public by the NRC.
 
(2)  In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with restrictions placed on use of the information.
 
 (3)  Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces under this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of this contract have been met.
 
(f)  Subcontracts.  Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in subcontracts of any tier.  The terms contract, contractor, and contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
 
(g)  Remedies.  For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract.
 
(h)  Waiver.  A request for waiver under this clause must be directed in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.
 
(i)  Follow-on effort.  The contractor shall be ineligible to participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefor (solicited or unsolicited), which stem directly from the contractor's performance of work under this contract.  Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor may not perform any technical consulting or management support services work or evaluation activities under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the contractor has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services.
 
(1)  If the contractor, under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications, the contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the statement of work or specifications.  The contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply.
 
(2)  Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government.

STATEMENT OF WORK

BACKGROUND – 
In April 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revised 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations.  The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants, consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.  Concomitant with this action, the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also offered to provide a supply to the local governments.   At the time of the original offer, only 130 mg adult tablets had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA guidelines on KI specify a pediatric dose of 65 mg. When the 65 mg dosage form of KI was approved by the FDA, the NRC informed the States that the NRC would be making 65 mg KI tablets available to the States and Federally-recognized Tribal Governments for their populations within the 10-mile EPZ.  State and local government officials have indicated a preference for 65 mg tablets rather than the 130 mg or combination thereof.  

OBJECTIVE
The Contractor shall provide shipments of 65mg KI tablets listed in the FDA’s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations and have an approved abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), in the quantities and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO).

SCOPE OF WORK

The Contractor shall supply and distribute 65 mg KI Tablets as ordered by the NRC.

CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS

Each 65 mg KI tablet shall be manufactured by an FDA-approved manufacturer and must be an FDA approved product with therapeutic equivalence evaluations and have an approved abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least two pieces.  Each 65 mg KI tablet shall have the maximum FDA-approved shelf life from date of acceptance by the NRC or the State or Tribe to which delivery was made.  Each tablet shall be individually packaged.

TASK 1 - SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS

The contractor shall provide 65mg KI tablets as ordered by the NRC. The estimated amount required for this contract is 9,000,000 tablets.  This figure is provided as an estimate only.  The NRC is not obligated to order the estimated number as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein. 

TASK 2 - DISTRIBUTION

The Contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the delivery order, no later than 90 days from receipt of the delivery order (see Attachment 1, for Locations) from the NRC PO.  The Contractor shall maintain records of the shipping logs, showing quantities sent, receiving organization and proof of delivery.  A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides ease of distribution, storage, and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets, once provided to the State or Tribe.  

DAMAGED/CRUSHED TABLETS

The Contractor shall replace, at no cost to the NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping.  The NRC will provide claims for replacement no later than 45 calendar days after delivery.  The Contractor shall replace the damaged/crushed tablets no later than 90 calendar days from receipt of NRC=s claim.

SUBMITTAL AND CONFIRMATION OF DELIVERY ORDER

The NRC PO will e-mail the request for the tablets to the Contractor and follow-up the e-mail request with a telephone call.  The Contractor shall provide an e-mail confirmation to the NRC PO.

BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.

POINT OF CONTACT

The Contractor shall designate one primary and one alternate personnel as point of contact.

(1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
(2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
 (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
 (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
(ii) Examples.
 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
(1) Listed end products.
 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin
 

 
(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

(2) __ Outside the United States.
 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 28 (twenty-eight) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, August 28, 2008.

For this competitive, best value (lowest price, technically acceptable), total small business set aside procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
- 	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
- 	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, August 28, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses no later than the deadline of 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, August 14, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101. The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

<DESC>See atachment for combined synopsis/solicitation

Here are some questions that the Navy has recieved and their answers:

Questions:

Voltage Requirement______
Inlet Water Content: _______ ppm
Target Oil Content Out: _______ppm
Oil Discharge Pressure:________psig
Oily Water Source: Bilge, Sump/Tank, Condenser (dryer), or Constant Feed
Suction Head: ______ feet
Controls: Nema 4x Control Box (Standard) or Hazardous Area Class I Div II
(optional)

Answers:

The voltage we will need is 3 Phase 440/480V 60HZ. The Navy does not know
the ppm content of the inlet tanks, but some tanks have just a skim of oil
on the surface, some have 6 inches worth of oil on the surface in 5 feet
worth of water. Target oil content out must be less than 15ppm (regulation).
We want it to be able to filter better to less than 10ppm. Oil discharge
pressure, no requirement. Suction head will be greater than 20 feet, that is
why we will be staging diaphragm pumps to pump into the unit and why we have
the motorized ball valve to control the flow. We only need the standard
control box, we are not working in an explosive enviornment.

Please note that no more questions will be answered after March 18, 2009.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 28 (twenty-eight) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, August 28, 2008.

For this competitive, best value (lowest price, technically acceptable), total small business set aside procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
- 	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
- 	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, August 28, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses no later than the deadline of 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 20, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101. The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

Any failure of the Contractor to take the actions described and acknowledged in this paragraph will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the work, or for proceeding to successfully perform the work without additional expense to the Government.(b) The Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government. Nor does the Government assume responsibility for any understanding reached or representation made concerning conditions which can affect the work by any of its officers or agents before the execution of this contract, unless that understanding or representation is expressly stated in this contract.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns.  IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICIATED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.  This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This requirement consists of two combined demolition projects. 

Project 01, Demolition of Administrative Facility 20126, Area B, Project ZHTV040010.  Complete demolition of a 3,235 square meter (34,827 gsf), 2-story (basement, 1st floor (16,708 gsf), 2nd Floor (16,718 gsf), brick exterior, building and adjacent sitework originally constructed in 1944 at 2644 Skyline Dr, Area B, Wright-Patterson AFB.  Project includes complete removal and demolition of both facility parking lots (2,822 square yards and 4,496 square yards) to include removal of sidewalks, curb & gutter, and necessary landscaping. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 calendar day period of performance for this portion of the project.  

Project 02, Demolish Spray Pond, Project Number 030018.  The spray pond consists of a 113’ x 208’ concrete slab area with retaining walls where four rows of piping conducted air cooled water to cool high velocity air that created mach conditions in the wind tunnel complex.  The wind tunnels have been demolished and the spray pond is no longer needed.  The concrete spray pond, fencing, spray headers and piping, pump houses, and asbestos piping insulation will be demolished and the remaining area graded for proper drainage and seeded. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 90 calendar day period of performance for this portion of the project.

The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

Prime contractors who are HUBZone or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 4:00 p.m. (local Dayton time) on 20 Mar 2009:

All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number and CAGE Code on your response.  Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered “non-responsive” in this requirement.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in PIXS and Federal Business Opportunities.

You are notified that the followingchanges are made: This modification provides further clarification, on the reasoning behind sole sourcingto Adrian Technologies.  This requirement is NOT a new initiative.  Rather it is acontinuation of training and projects that began in 2007 across the Agency with AdrianTechnologies.  The projected completion for the initiative is 2010.  Currently 600 LaRCemployees have been exposed to this vendor's materials and project management.	Changingvendors at LaRC in the middle of the current roll out would cause confusion, duplication,and increase costs in training and current projects at both center and agency levels.Accordingly, LaRC will pursue a sole source agreement with Adrian Technologies for thesereasons.		 The due date for responses is extended to March 18, 2009.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

This Acquisition shall be competed as SMALL BUSINESS.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A Small Business solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Small Business within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $20 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 Thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<BR><BR>There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $140 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as 8(a) within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $15 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 Thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<BR><BR>There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.
