<DESC>Description: <br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The NIA Clinical Research Unit conducts human studies that require continuous cardiac monitoring. The current system is very old and unserviceable. Most of the equipment is unusable and we have limited options for monitoring. When the last unit fails, clincal studies requiring carding monitoring must be stopped. Therefore, a new method of monitoring participants is critical to continuing present and future research studies requiring cardiac monitoring.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br />The central station is needed to continuously monitor participants from the nurses's station. The telemetry system is wireless and is hooked up to the participant for mobile monitoring. The mobile care viewer allows the nurses to monitor the particiaptns from other areas on the unit. Wirelsss network system links all the above together.</p>
<p>Anticipated Deliver Schedule: 60 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The place of performance shall be the National Institute on Aging location at 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21224.</p>

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted<br />(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.  If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.</p>
<p>(b) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<br />52.252-6 Authorized Deviations in Clauses.

<p>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer.  In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope.  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity.  For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure.  The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.  The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.  The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.  Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies.  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.  If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts.  The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.  The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.  The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.  If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver.  The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.  Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />1352.237-71   SECURITY PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS-LOW RISK CONTRACTS (APR 2010)<br />1352.237-73   FOREIGN NATIONAL VISITOR AND GUEST ACCESS TO DEPARTMENTAL RESOURCES (APR 2010)<br />52.204-7 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (JUL 2013)<br />52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)</p>
<p>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):<br />https://acqquisition.gov/far<br />(End of clause)<br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN<br />(a) The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities. <br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting <br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency <br /> (b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br /> (c) Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />(d)There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&not;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to  another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity). <br /> (e) After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />(f) The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />(g) Questions regarding items (a) through (f) within this language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />AWARDS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA OR PEER-REVIEWED<br />PUBLICATIONS (OCT 2016)<br />Special Award Conditions:<br />1. Data Sharing: Environmental data collected, created, or generated under this contract or<br />order must be made publicly visible and accessible in a timely manner, free of charge or at<br />minimal cost that is no more than the cost of distribution to the user, except where limited by<br />law, regulation, policy, or national security requirements. Data are to be made available by the<br />contractor in a form that would permit further analysis or reuse: data must be encoded in a<br />machine-readable format, preferably using existing open format standards; data must be<br />sufficiently documented, preferably using open metadata standards, to enable users to<br />independently read and understand the data. The location (internet address) of the data should be<br />included in the final report. Pursuant to NOAA Information Quality Guidelines, data should<br />undergo quality control (QC) and a description of the QC process and results should be<br />referenced in the metadata. Link to guidelines:<br />http://www.cio.noaa.gov/services_programs/IQ_Guidelines_103014.html</p>
<p>2. Environmental data are defined by NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 212-15:<br />Management of Environmental Data and Information as recorded and derived observations and<br />measurements of the physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical properties and<br />conditions of the oceans, atmosphere, space environment, sun, and solid earth, as well as<br />correlative data such as socio-economic data (personally-identifiable information regarding<br />human subjects must be properly protected or removed), related documentation, and metadata.<br />Digital audio or video recordings of environmental phenomena (such as animal sounds or<br />undersea video) are included in this definition. Numerical model outputs (the data produced by<br />computer simulations of environmental processes) are included in this definition, particularly if<br />they are used to support the conclusion of a peer-reviewed publication. Data collected in a<br />laboratory or other controlled environment, such as measurements of animals and chemical<br />processes, are included in this definition. This does not apply to laboratory notebooks,<br />preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports,<br />communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens.</p>
<p>3. Data Accessibility: Approved submission of data by the contractor to NOAA National<br />Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), or to a publicly accessible data repository as<br />specified in the approved Data Management Plan, shall be sufficient to satisfy the data<br />accessibility requirement as of the date the submission was performed. The contractor shall<br />notify the NOAA Program Official when data accessibility has been performed. After the<br />acceptance of data by the government, unless specifically required in the solicitation, Data<br />Management Guidance, and period of performance of the contract, the contractor is not required<br />to maintain the data. Once the performance period for the contract has expired, the contractor is<br />no longer responsible for maintaining this information. If the data are not submitted to NCEI,<br />but are instead made accessible by some other means (e.g., on a web server hosted by the<br />contractor) then contractor should explain plan for continued availability after the contract period<br />ends.</p>
<p>4. Timeliness: Data accessibility must occur no later than publication of a peer-reviewed<br />article based on the data, or two years after the data are collected and verified, or two years after<br />the original end date of the contract or order (not including any extensions or follow-on funding),<br />whichever is soonest, unless an extension to the date for data submission has been authorized by<br />the Contracting Officer in coordination with the NOAA Program Official.</p>
<p>5. Disclaimer: The Contractor shall ensure the following statement accompanies data produced<br />under this award and made available to the public: "These data and related items of information<br />have not been formally disseminated by NOAA, and do not represent any agency determination,<br />view, or policy."</p>
<p>6. Failure to Share Data: Failure or delay on the part of the contractor to make environmental<br />data accessible in accordance with the approved Data Management Plan, unless authorized by<br />the Contracting Officer, may lead to enforcement actions, and will be considered by NOAA<br />when making future award decisions. The contractor is responsible for ensuring subcontractors<br />also meet these conditions.</p>
<p>7. Funding acknowledgement: Federal funding sources shall be identified by the contractor in<br />all scholarly publications. An Acknowledgements section shall be included in the body of the<br />publication stating the relevant contract award number. In addition, funding sources shall be<br />reported during the publication submission process using the FundRef2 mechanism, located at<br />http://www.crossref.org/fundref/, if supported by the Publisher.</p>
<p>8. Manuscript submission: The final pre-publication manuscripts of scholarly publications<br />produced with NOAA funding shall be submitted to the NOAA Institutional Repository located<br />at http://library.noaa.gov/repository after acceptance, and no later than upon publication, of the<br />paper or article by a journal. NOAA will produce a publicly visible catalog entry directing users<br />to the published version of the article. After an embargo period of one year after publication,<br />NOAA will make the manuscript itself publicly visible, free of charge, while continuing to direct<br />users to the published version of record.</p>
<p>9. Data Citation: Publications based on data, and new products derived from source data,<br />must cite the data used according to the conventions of the Publisher, using unambiguous labels<br />such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). All data and derived products that are used to support<br />the conclusions of a peer-reviewed publication must be made available in a form that permits<br />verification and reproducibility of the results.<br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -<br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>

In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4.

The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv.

<p>(e) Remedies.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.
