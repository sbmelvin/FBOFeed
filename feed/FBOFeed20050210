(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.
(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.
(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.
(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:
NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].
* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:
NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].
(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.
(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.
(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<DESC>Continuing a centuries-old legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering design for a two-phase renovation of an existing border station located in Derby Line, Vermont, including, the construction of new port facilities including the Main Port, commercial, non-commercial and Agency vehicle garages, the demolition of existing Port buildings and completion of site improvements in the area of the existing building.  GSA Region One Solicitation No. GS-01P-05-BZC-0004.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is over $10 million.

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a port facility that includes: the construction of new buildings and related systems, parking areas, site development, client program requirements and sustainable features.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements.  The project will be LEED certified.  

The United States Port Facilities at Derby Line are located on U.S. Interstate 91 at the International Border separating Vermont and the Canadian Province of Quebec.  The proposed site surrounds the existing border station with associated secondary buildings, parking areas and State Highway rights- of-way.  This proposed project will be a state-of-the-art facility and should make a distinct architectural statement responsive to the environment and representive of the character and stature of a federal building.  

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  The Lead Designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design. A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within a 100 mile radius of the site.  During Phase II the government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  

The A/E selection will be completed in TWO stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This will be a two-phase solicitation process with Phase One being a total small business set-aside.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal in response to the Phase One solicitation.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The work will be located primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska, but the scope of the contract will also include Coast Guard construction projects within the states of Washington and Oregon.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about April 28, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.  HSARPA performs these functions, in part, by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories and academic institutions.

The goal of the HSARPA Low Vapor Pressure Chemicals Detection Systems (LVPCDS) Program is to develop, field-test, and transition to commercialization existing, state-of-the-art and next generation systems that can detect toxic compounds having low vapor pressures (&#8804; 10-4 Torr) without coming in contact with the contaminated surface.  The DHS S&T Directorate has identified two high priority requirements as Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) to be addressed in this solicitation (These TTAs are described in greater detail in Section 4, “LVPCDS Program Goals”).
 The LVPCDS Program will facilitate a number of DHS goals, including:
&#61607;	Enabling novel and cost effective enhancements to existing detection systems for rapid deployment;
&#61607;	Development of next generation detection systems providing superior performance, ease of operation, and cost; and
&#61607;	Development of revolutionary technologies, subsystems or components with significant impact on cost and/or performance of existing or next generation detection systems.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-05-R-0050 solicits/requests proposals for Developmental Aircrew Protective Clothing and Devices for use in Tactical, Rotary, and Support Aircraft. Responses to this BAA submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein will be accepted at the Contracting Office for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this announcement. No formal solicitation will be issued; this BAA is the solicitation. AREAS OF INTEREST - Areas of interest include new, innovative approaches to providing enhanced aircrew protection/performance in current and future Navy tactical, rotary and support aircraft. Topic areas include but are not limited to: (1) protection against G-induced loss of consciousness, loss of situational awareness, spatial disorientation, and high altitude hypoxia; (2) development of micro/nanotechnology applicable to life support and protective devices; (3) protection against hypothermia/hyperthermia; (4) auxiliary or integrated human cooling and heating systems; (5) integrated helmet mounted displays, multi-mode helmet vision system technology; (6) advanced filter/device development for eye and / or sensor protection; (7) aircrew / equipment compatibility; (8) aircrew breathing systems and advanced concept approaches for current and future aircraft applications; (9) improved crash protection, advanced restraint systems (all axes of restraint), and seating concepts; (10) emergency egress/escape concepts such as but not limited to improved signaling/locating, thermal signature reduction, and day/night cloaking technologies (11) improved / integrated communications systems; (12) improved hearing protection and communiction capabilities in high noise environments (13) improved / integrated floatation systems; (14) human strength enhancement technologies; (15) improved garment textiles/materials flame resisitance and improved garment textile/materials, flame resistant and melt-proof fibers, webbings, water-proof, high-stretch, breathable fabrics, durable, malleable, lightweight conductive-network fabrics, low-bulk/high flexibility vascular compression mechanisms for acceleration protection, fast-response cooling/heating textiles (16) improved lightweight, portable power sources, recharging and scavenging technologies; and (17) other threat protection technologies. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION - Proposals may address one or more of the areas listed above. Proposals shall be limited to advanced development where concept feasibility has already been demonstrated. The period of performance may range from .5 up to 4 years at a level of effort of .5 to 5 work-years per year. Reasonable deviations/exceptions will be considered. More than one proposal may be submitted during the twelve (12) month period following publication of this announcement. Technical proposals shall not exceed fifty (50) pages. Cost proposals shall include a detailed breakdown of proposed cost/prices. Offerors shall submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of their proposal to Contracts, Attn: Roberta Nethercutt, Department Of The Navy, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (2.5.1.3.2.1), 21983 Bundy Road, Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. The cost of preparation of a response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract. PROPOSAL EVALUATION - Proposals will be evaluated as they are received. Merit shall be determined based on: (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility; (3) the offeror's experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these criteria which are integral for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional contracts using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement agreements e.g. Cooperative Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 and Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be ultimately determined by the Government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract/agreement modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract/agreement, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act. AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposals technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvataged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the Contracting Officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Subcontracting Plan, in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, with the proposal package. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. POINTS OF CONTACT - The technical point of contact is Dr. James Sheehy, AIR 4.6T (301) 342-8480, e-mail: James.Sheehy@navy.mil while Ms. Roberta Nethercutt (301) 757-8939, email: Roberta. Nethercutt@navy.mil is the point of contact for all contractual matters. Offerors may contact these individuals at any time for clarification of technical/contractual issues and cost proposal format.

The purpose of this announcement is to support Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program Demonstrations for Department of Defense (DoD) and other Government programs.  The Signals Warfare Mini-RF team, Code 452400D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), will survey the Mini-RF technologies that are currently available or will be available in the near future that will meet current and future program needs.  NAWCWD will award contracts based on current program needs and/or will select Mini-RF technologies that could provide a significant technology push for DoD and DoD related programs.  To fulfill its mission, the Aerospace Mini-RF technology team may require the Contractor to support and/o! r transition the advanced concept(s) developed under these contracts to a source for fabrication, integration, and/or demonstration.  The goal of the Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program is to demonstrate the feasibility of affordable multifunction/integrated miniature RF technologies that can be utilized on various aerospace platforms.  Thus, the Aerospace Mini-RF technology team takes a systems engineering approach to identify the key RF related technology concepts that exhibit sufficient potential for future development efforts.  The Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program Demonstrations will integrate modules and components with various RF functionalities, and demonstrate the performance and technical potential of these components.  Proven integrated concept components may be retained as part of future demonstration systems or transitioned to operational systems. The major objective of the program is the rapid concept development and demonstration of reliable Mini-RF aerospace sensors.  Functional sensor areas for the Mini-RF technologies to be addressed include but are not limited to:   a. Mini-RF sensors b. Mini-RF Communication (Comms) Subsystem c. Mini-RF Integrated Sensor and Communication Subsystem  d. Mini-RF Multi-Function Sensor Contracts to be awarded under this BAA shall require work specified in one or more of the functional sensor areas contained in this announcement.  The Contractors are expected to submit White Papers on one or more of the following module/component technologies within any functional sensor area.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Faces and Voices of Recovery, Washington, DC.

Purpose:
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) has used Voices of Recovery (Faces and Voices), a coalition public awareness project working to help solve America’s problem of alcohol and drug addiction, for the past five years.  Faces and Voices, has collaborated with HHS/SAMHSA efforts and grantees to help the agency unify and empower the alcohol and drug addiction field to effectively spread the message that substance use disorders are a national health issue; that addiction treatment is effective; to heighten awareness of the need to expand the Nation’s treatment capacity; and the need to reduce the stigma associated with addiction and treatment; and finally, to reduce barriers to treatment – to include increasing access for Americans with disabilities.  
There is a growing need for consumers of substance abuse treatment and recovery services to join forces and become active in transforming the treatment and recovery services available to all Americans.  This recovery-driven transformation helps to educate the general public, individuals and organizations providing services and financial support for services, to understand consumer needs for available and effective treatment options and to lower the barriers to finding and maintaining recovery from addiction to alcohol and drugs. This includes working with organizations and individuals to educate and reduce barriers and stigma related with medication assisted options and recovery for alcohol, illicit drugs and opioid dependent individuals.  This initiative will also work towards that goal through a training and public education project to combat the stigma and discrimination against people in recovery and those seeking recovery.  
 The overall mission of Faces and Voices is to educate the American public in order to lead the development of more enlightened approaches and practices to substantially reduce the nation’s problem of addiction. Working in conjunction with current HHS/SAMHSA programs, a strong alliance and partnership was created.  By teaming with Faces and Voices, HHS/SAMHSA expands its visibility, reputation and credibility as the federal driving force in reducing the nation’s substance use disorders problems.
Faces and Voices has the capacity and the mission that are a unique fit to help SAMHSA fulfill their cross-cutting principles such as: (1) collaboration with public and private partners; (2) recovery/reducing stigma and barriers to services; and (3) community-based approaches. In addition, Faces and Voices of Recovery will help with Program and Issue initiatives such as: (1) substance abuse treatment capacity and (2) the New Freedom Initiative.

<DESC>The Substance and Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Synergies,  Austin, Texas.

Purpose:
There is a need for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) to continue their partnership with the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) to provide support for an education campaign to alert the public to the dangers of inhalants.  SAMHSA/CSAT support will be provided to identify the latest research data on inhalants including what constitutes effective treatment from various experts which may include persons from pertinent Federal agencies, the faith community, foundations, medical groups, trade associations, poison control centers and other interested parties.  SAMHSA/CSAT will help the develop new information tools that can be incorporated into ongoing educational materials issued by the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC).  There is no other organization with this type of commitment and expertise involving inhalant abuse, and therefore the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition is the only source for this type of effort.
The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) was founded in 1992 by Synergies, a non-profit corporation based in Austin, Texas.  NIPC is a public-private effort to promote awareness and recognition of the under-publicized problem of inhalant use and its deadly consequences.  NIPC is the only organization of its type with the contacts, know-how and dedication to combating inhalant abuse necessary to bring this project to fruition.
NIPC is an inhalant and information clearinghouse concerning inhalant related issues.  The Coalition generates media coverage, develops education and information materials, produces a quarterly newsletter, and provides training and technical assistance.  NIPC works with Federal, state and local government agencies, schools, businesses, trade associations, media, civic organizations, law enforcement, poison control centers, the medical community and interfaith groups throughout the country to develop awareness and prevention campaigns designed to educate youth and adults about the dangers of inhalants.  NIPC also provides in-service training for educators and maintains a web site on inhalants.  The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition created and continues National Inhalants & Poisons Awareness Week.
The partnership with NIPC is a direct link to various SAMHSA/CSAT projects such as the Recovery Communities Services Program, Partners for Recovery, the annual National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (September), and SAMHSA/CSAT youth initiative grants.
The problem of inhalant abuse is pervasive throughout the country.  Abuse affects all classes and cultures in our society.  Experimenters include our youngest children.  Consequences of use can be fatal, even at first use.  There are only a couple of treatment facilities equipped to deal with chronic abusers.  To effectively respond to inhalant abuse a thoughtful and coordinated approach must be developed and implemented.
There are multitudes of every day products in the homes, schools and businesses across America that, when misused, caused irreversible damage or even death to America=s youth.  Currently there is no comprehensive treatment or prevention policy.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Agency, Northern Region; Dugway Proving Ground, Utah Directorate of Contracting (hereinafter referred to as the Government) is seeking comments on a DRAFT Request for Proposal for a Test Documentation and Management Support Servi ces requirement to be performed at the West Desert Test Center (WDTC).  The WDTC plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on tests of military equipment; and tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with this equipment.  WDTCs mission focuses on mili tary chemical / biological (CB) defense, smoke, and illumination systems; and related operational concepts.  WDTC also plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, such as munitio n system assessments.  The WDTC regularly participates in the development and validation of technologies and methodologies to support assigned testing. The scope of effort involves supporting the WDTC test mission at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah installation.  The support involves (as associated with specific task orders) conducting technical studies associated with experimental design and statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, developing computer software applications, providing technical writing support, preparing test plans, preparing other documents associated with testing (e.g., environmental assessments), monitoring data acqu isition in the field, reducing and statistically analyzing data collected, preparing test reports, editing documents, preparing new documents and editing previously prepared Government documents in various stages of development, and preparing comments on G overnment documents.  WDTC is currently fully certified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001-2000 Quality Management System.  WDTC is fully committed to this standard and continues working to stay fully compliant with the standard.  This requires maintaining extensive oversight of the overall WDTC quality system.  Because documents are one of WDTCs primary products, quality controls in the development of each document are critical to WDTCs success as an industry leader.  It is imperative that WDT C effectively control all documents associated with our testing environment.  Standing Operating Procedures (SOP), Test Operations Procedures (TOP), Division manuals, work instructions and all other test related documents must be secured and kept up to dat e.  The ultimate contract will require the Contractor to play a significant role in the management of all WDTC controlled documents.  The Contractor must have demonstrated experience in ISO 9001-2000 Quality Management Systems and an ability to manage docu mentation under the ISO 9000 standard. It is intent of the Government to issue a small business set-aside, cost plus fixed fee solicitation (W911S6-05-R-0004) for this requirement.  The applicable NAICS code is  541710 (500 employees).  The proposed solicitation is planned to be for one (1) bas e year and four (4) option periods (12-months each).  Any information / comments provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government.  The official solicitation will be announced separately.  This announcement does not constit ute a Request for Proposal, or a request for competitive proposals, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. COMMENT PROCEDURES: 1) Request an electronic copy of the DRAFT RFP and cost breakdown spreadsheet by sending an email request to Eric S. Vokt, Contracting Officer at vokte@dpg.army.mil.

NEUROTECHNOLOGY FOR INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS (NIA), SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 1, DUE: 4/15/04. POC: Dr. Amy Kruse, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4338, Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519. 

PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: 
The Defense Research Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving innovative proposals to conduct research and development on neuroscience-based tools to aid intelligence analysts.  The vision for the Neurotechnology for Intelligence Analysts (NIA) program is to revolutionize the way that analysts handle intelligence imagery, increasing both the throughput of imagery to the analyst and accuracy of their assessments. 
Analysts are currently faced with an enormous volume of imagery, only a fraction of which can be processed or reviewed in a timely operational manner.  Unfortunately, computer-based target detection efforts have failed to yield the speed, flexibility and accuracy of the human visual system.  We hypothesize that the human visual system is still the best target detection apparatus currently in use and with the addition of neuroscience-based measurement capabilities it can surpass the throughput of the unaided human several-fold. 
Using electroencephalograpy (EEG), Thorpe et al (Nature, 1996) have described a fast signal in the brain associated with the early detection of targets within static imagery using a Rapid Sequential Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm.  This phenomenon suggests that it may be possible to extract target detection signals for complex imagery in real-time using non-invasive neurophysiological assessment tools to indicate the presence of targets significantly faster than waiting for overt indications.  

In order to transform this phenomenon into a capability for defense applications, DARPA is pursuing a 12 month Phase 1 effort to achieve the following technical goals:

1) Discover and characterize the neural signatures for target detection events in the human brain.  Imagery of interest:
	a) Static imagery
	b) Large/Broad Area imagery
	c) Video imagery
Phase 1 will concentrate on static imagery; however, proposals should consider the technical challenges necessary to uncover related signatures in broad area and video imagery.  Proposers may utilize any type of neurophysiological sensors (COTS or novel); however only fast signals, on the order of milliseconds, are of interest for this effort. 

2) Measure neural signatures in real-time for the on-line classification of target detection signals in the brain.  Proposers may utilize signal processing techniques already described, or suggest the development of novel processing algorithms; however, only single-trial (ie non-trial-averaged) methods are of interest.  

3) Demonstrate the measurement and classification of neural signals for target detection in real-time.  The Phase 1 goal demonstration is an image “triage” system in which subjects are rapidly shown static imagery, signals are classified in real time and the corresponding imagery shown is then sorted – based on the classification of the neural signatures – into sets of images that contain targets/regions of interest versus those that contain none.  

At the end of the 12 month Phase 1 effort a demonstration, as described, is expected. Phase 1 efforts will be evaluated on the technical goals as stated in 1)-3), and on performance goals including 1) the ability to increase the number of images shown to analysts over a constrained period of time (throughput)  2) the accuracy with which the triage systems are able to correctly categorize imagery based on the neural signatures (false positives and false negatives) as compared to a non-neurally-based triage baseline condition.

Based on the success of Phase 1, there is the potential for an 18 month Phase 2 effort to mature successful demonstrations into prototype systems for transition to operational use.  Proposers are invited, although not required, to outline a Phase 2 effort in their submissions.  If a Phase 2 is discussed, proposers should consider all necessary research and technical efforts to develop a successful prototype brain-based triage system for eventual deployment in an office-based analysis setting.

OTHER NOTES:
Although the initial phenomenon has been described with EEG, this solicitation is open to the use of any number of sensors or sensor combinations to achieve the program vision.  If multiple sensor types are proposed, one MUST be neurophysiologically-based in order to be evaluated for award.  Designs for novel sensors will be considered as part of this effort, provided offerers address the three stated technical goals.

Efforts that combine computer processing and neuroscience-based capabilities will be considered.  However, this program is not focused on the design of computer vision or biomimetic target detection systems and proposers offering solutions involving solely that approach will not be considered for award.

Through the program, awardees will have the opportunity to use UNCLAS image sets in their testing provided by potential transition partners.

SUBMISSIONS:
White papers (10 pages or less) will be accepted in response to this announcement. The white paper should be organized as follows:
       
1.	An Executive Summary.  A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea. We are looking for ideas that will generate revolutionary capabilities if the proposed work is successfully completed over a 3 year period of performance;
2.	A concise statement of the scientific and technical challenges, unique approaches, and anticipated potential technical solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This statement should demonstrate that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art; 
3.	Explicit timelines and milestone achievements by which progress toward the goals can be evaluated.  These milestones must reflect a period of performance of 12 months for Phase 1.  Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics of performance; 
4.	A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding; 
5.	A brief summary of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members and a management plan for multi-organizational teams.
      6. Brief list of relevant references.

    White papers sent in response to this addendum are due at DARPA no later than 1600 hours ET, March 7, 2005. Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 15 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested. To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/. Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.

FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSALS.  Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa05-19.  To receive consideration under this addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 ET APRIL 15, 2004, at the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA only.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a full proposal created with the requirements listed in this addendum and in accordance with the original BAA05-19 published.  Note: if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system at the address listed below or the BAA e-mail account.

Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the areas of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal, 3) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.

Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program. Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged. Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 12 months; however, proposers are invited to submit proposals for a full Phase1/Phase 2 research program. If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements. Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. 

PROPOSAL EVALUATION:
Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA05-19. For complete details on writing a full proposal, please see original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA05-19, http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This will be a two-phase solicitation process with Phase One being a total small business set-aside.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal in response to the Phase One solicitation.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The projects will be located in Alaska, primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about April 28, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

QUESTION #1:  Will the statement of work be classified? If so, to what level? If so, will it require the proposal to be classified?

QUESTION #5:  The synopsis indicated individuals are required to have TS-SCI to do the work beginning April 1, 2005.  Since this level of clearance is so difficult to obtain, will we be able to start with individuals with this clearance on an interim basis until we can get the necessary clearance for those who will work it on a permanent basis?  ANSWER:  AS STATED IN THE SYNOPSIS, CONTRACTOR MUST ALREADY POSSESS TS/SCI CLEARANCE.

QUESTION #6:  I'm wondering if this is a new requirement or if there is an incumbent contractor.  Also how many people do you anticipate for this requirement?  ANSWER:  THIS IS A FIRST TIME BUY FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD.  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT UP TO THE CONTRACTOR.

QUESTION #9: Would there be a problem with contractor subbing out some portions of the contract?  Would contractor's "Teaming" with a non Disabled owned firm prevent contract award?  ANSWER:  CONTACT THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT WILL QUAILFY UNDER THE SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM.

QUESTION #10: I can see that this contract is currently set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses however I wish to know if you do not obtain sufficient responses from this category if you would be willing to open the contract up to Woman Owned Minority, SDB certified small business?  ANSWER:  ADEQUATE COMPETITION FOR SERVICE DISABLE VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THIS SOLICITATION.


QUESTION #11:  We would like to have the incumbent's POC's name and phone and email, if possible.  ANSWER:  UNAVAILABLE, AS THIS IS A FIRST TIME BUY FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD.

<DESC>As part of its contract program for the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), the Centers for Research on Mothers and Children (CRMC) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a contract requirement to establish a Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) Center to study the use of Lithium for treatment of mania in pediatric patients. NICHD seeks to obtain clinical data on the use of Lithium for treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD) in pediatric populations, which will lead to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling of Lithium for this purpose. 

The NICHD already has awarded contracts for several BPCA studies, including a contract for a BPCA Coordinating Center.  Additional information on BPCA and NICHD can be found at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/oppb/bpca/index.htm.

The Studies will include the following:  (1) a pharmacokinetic study of at least 18 patients that will evaluate different sequences of titrations to reach a maximum tolerated dose (the results of this study will be used to select doses for the subsequent efficacy studies); (2) a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled acute trial that will last a minimum of 6 weeks that will sufficiently detect an distinction in efficacy between lithium and placebo; and (3) a long-term safety study, of no less than 6 months drug exposure, to monitor for adverse events.  The final number of patients to be recruited and retained will depend on the final protocols approved by the NICHD and FDA.  

This contract requirement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).     As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one or more cost-reimbursement incrementally funded completion-type contract(s), with a period of performance of 36 months, will be awarded as a result of the RFP.     

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).     It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before January 31, 2005 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.     All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).     The reference number to be used for this announcement is: NIH-NICHD-2005-07. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by telephone to Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer, at (301) 435-8867.

The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.     The Government also reserves the right to cancel this procurement at any time prior to contract award.

A final decision has not been reached at this time regarding foreign source participation and the Government reserves the right to include or exclude foreign sources at a later date.  Award is anticipated for December 2005.   Approximately 1,000–15,000 DSU-33 units (various configurations) may be procured for the Air Force, Navy and potential Foreign Military inventories within the first year of contract award.  Additional quantities of 1,000-15,000 units per year may be procured as yearly priced options through FY12.  The DSU-33 must function with General Purpose bombs, such as the M-117 and MK-80 series, in both high and low drag configurations, and with Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) weapons. These bombs have fuze systems, such as the FMU-139/B, FMU-139B/B, FMU-139A/B and FMU-152A/B, to which the DSU-33 will be required to provide a sensor fire pulse for above ground bomb detonation.  The fuze and sensor will be initiated via either the FZU-48 or the FZU-55A/B in the Air Force configuration, or the Fuze Function Control Set in the Navy configuration.  The sensor shall be qualified (certifiable) for use on the following aircraft and each of their series: Marine AV-8, Navy/Marine F/A-18, and Air Force A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22, B-52, B-1, B-2 and JSF.  A DSU-33 Performance Specification and Interface Control Drawing shall be provided to all offerors by contacting the Contracting Officer or the Contract Specialist shown above.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INVITATION FOR BID AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  All responses to this synopsis shall be evaluated in the following areas: 1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of proximity sensor requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US aircraft, and system safety requirements; 2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble proximity sensor hardware; 3) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of the proximity sensors in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; 4) Ability to deliver qualified sensors in accordance with production schedule; 5) Due to the extended period of performance of this contract, responses shall also be evaluated on the contractor’s ability to perform system engineering product improvements over the life of the contract resulting from issues such as, but not limited to: parts obsolescence, evolving technologies, countermeasures, and form/fit issues for potential new weapon systems; and 6) Ability to incorporate flexible manufacturing processes to accommodate quantity fluctuations from year to year.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This is not a Request for Proposal. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Th e Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate (SLAD) of the U. S. Army Research Laboratory (USARL), is conducting market research in support of is its mission to provide survivability/lethality analysis of U. S. Army weapon systems and other programs.  Th e information provided by interested parties will enable ARL/SLAD to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to develop and manufacture an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) subsystem.  This AWG  subsystem is envisioned as a possible component which may be integrated into existing electronic countermeasures systems both ground based and airborne.  A previous survey of commercial off the shelf (COTS) arbitrary waveform generators reveals commercial ly offered units are laboratory grade instruments directed to the test community and are not suitable for integration into existing systems.  Preliminary requirements for the AWG are as follows:  Prime Power:  12.0 to 28.0 VDC, ± 1.0VDC; Desired number of digital to analog converter bits:  12; Desired Sample Rate:  500MHz; Waveform Memory: 10M words desired, the waveform memory must be capable of maintaining waveform data independently of prime power.  The AWG must have the capability of zeroing waveform me mory via command or logic control input; Controller:  Supervisory processor to control waveform down loading, waveform output enable, and other functions; Output impedance: 50ohms; Output voltage:  programmable, with the following ranges:  TBD; Output filt ering:  Low pass anti alias filter, cut off frequency dependent upon final sample rate; Operating temperature range:  0 to 70C; Data interface:  High speed such as USB, Ethernet, etc. Large and Small Businesses are encouraged to submit product information,  pertinent details, capabilities and experience related to the stated requirement via email to bgerace@arl.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Information for upcoming Safety Attendants Services for DODDS Schools in Korea, Japan, and Okinawa
<DESC>Special Notice IAW FAR 5.205 - Request for Information: Closes 25 Feb 2005.  Please provide all inputs by the closing date.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Department of Defense Dependent Schools Pacific (DoDDS-P) Procurement Division located in Okinawa Japan is issuing a request for information (RFI) seeking possible future sources for School Bus Security Attendants. DoDDS-P operates approximately 250 school busses during 183 school days. Service is located in Korea, main land Japan, and Okinawa Japan. The service is defined in the attached DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO). Industry is requested to review the SOO and provide inputs as to areas that may be unclear, are inconsistent with commercial standards, or could be improved/clarified by the government prior to final release.  Information provided shall be safe guarded IAW FAR 15.207. Other company information can be sent by mail to the address listed in this RFI and will be added to the list of potential offerors, but it is solely the responsibility of offerors to ensure that they monitor the Federal Business Opportunities web-site for postings and updates. All information provided by potential sources shall be withheld for official use only and shall not be divulged to the general public.  Please submit your concerns, inputs and company information to either: gerogette_hendricksen@pac.odedodea.edu or jerome.conway@pac.odedodea.edu. Mailing Address: DoDDS Pacific PACTMO Div Attn: Georgette Hendricksen Unit 35007 APO AP 96376 NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A FORMAL SOLICITATION DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS TIME. THE RESULTING SOLICITATION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND HAS AN EXPECTED RELEASE DATE OF 24 MARCH 2005.  THE FINAL SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED TO THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WEB-SITE.  

Government Intentions:  The following are intentions of the government under consideration to be incorporated to the final solicitation.  Feedback from potential offerors is welcome and will be considered in the final revision(s) of the resulting solicitation.

1)  The government intends to place three CLINs for each contract year representing the regions of Korea, mainland Japan, and Okinawa.  Offerors will be allowed to propose either for all the regions or individual CLINs.  Each offeror may submit separate offers representing all the regions while another price proposal set for if the award is split to separate regions. 
SAMPLE CLIN STRUCTURE (Sub CLINS for Safety Attendants and Administrative Assistance will be placed under each region)
0001 Korea
0002 Japan
0003 Okinawa 
Offerors may bid for all three regions or just one or two.  This is to maximize competition and allow access to companies that are potentially unable to perform in other regions or countries.  As a result, the award may be split to several offerors with separately awarded contracts or all awarded to one contractor.  Award will be evaluated under “Best Value” practices.  The following provision will be incorporated to the solicitation:
“ The Government reserves the right to make split awards from this solicitation. Each region (Korea, Japan and Okinawa) may be awarded as all together or separately to the offeror(s) that the Government determines to have submitted the proposal that offers the best value to the Government, considering technical scores and prices. Offerors are encouraged to propose to all regions, but may propose to individual CLINs/regions.  Offerors may elect to propose separate pricing schedules for all region prices and/or a separate pricing schedule for individual region prices, but it’s the responsibility of the offeror to ensure each alternative is clear. ” 

2)  CLINs for Safety Attendants sub-CLIN(s) will be established on a Firm Fixed price basis with the provided routes attached as the schedules for bid preparation.  The CLINs will be for a daily rate for the routes to be completed in that region as per the attached schedules in the SOO.  Annually or periodically throughout the year, DODDS Pacific STO may change routes and durations to ensure maximum efficiency.  Changes that result in an aggregate increase or decrease of 15% or less to the contracted schedules will not be subject to contract adjustment. Administrative Assistant sub-CLIN(s) will be a deliverable CLIN and ordered by the government during necessary times of the year.

3)  The solicitation will be released with the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO).  The attached SOO reflects the objectives and end results that the government expects. The SOO is an alternative to a government prepared SOW. A SOO provides the Government’s overall objectives and the offeror’s required support to achieve the contractual objectives. Offerors use the SOO as a basis for preparing a SOW, which is then included as an integral part of the proposal that the government evaluates during the source selection.

<SUBJECT>--MARKET SURVEY DEV-2005-04: Advanced Petroleum Test Kit
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY DESCRIPTION   MARKET SURVEY DEV-2005-04 Advanced Petroleum Test Kit   DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a re quest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informati on requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. The Petroleum Quality and Handling Team (PQHT) of the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command requests information on technology for a field portable petroleum test kit.  This information is presently being sought for planning purposes, on ly. POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT:   PQHT is conducting a market survey to identify sources that can provide information for technology to be used as part of the Advanced Petroleum Test Kit (APTK).  Technology information (partial or whole) meeting the requirements for the complete kit or any  of the components within the kit is requested. The APTK is designed to provide a final quality surveillance check of bulk fuel stocks before the fuel is loaded into retail tankers and prior to issue into the consuming end item.   The APTK shall determine the usability of JP8, JP5, Jet A and diesel fuels contained in 1 person portable field test kit.  It is designed to identify the most common forms of fuel contamination: water, sediment, and commingling of the product with other ty pes of fuel.  A new capability that would be desired in the field would be additive detection. Current technology used for free water is Gammons Aqua-Glo (ASTM D 3240).  This measures the undissolved water in a fuel sample on a test pad by a UV light and then compares it to a reference.  The minimum detection level for free water is: 10 ppm.  A new  capability is desired to detect the minimum free water level in the field by either direct measurements or indirect measurements. Current test procedure for particulates is the laboratory gravimetric method by line sampling (ASTM D 2276).  This method uses a vacuum pump to flow a 1 gallon fuel sample through a 0.8 um filter.  The final weight of the test pad is measured and compared to the initial weight.  The difference in weight is an indication of the particulate level in the fuel. The minimum detection level for particulates is 1 mg/L.  The purpose of determining particulate levels is used as a monthly check to ensure the filter-s eparators are working properly.  A new capability is desired that can comparably provide an indication of particulate level at 1 mg/L in the field either by direct measurements or indirect measurements. Commingling and identification of the product is currently conducted by bulky, outdated, laboratory equipment.  Current tests include flashpoint, distillation, and API gravity.  A new method of obtaining these measurements either directly or indirectly is desired.   Additive detection includes identifying levels of fuel system icing inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor, static dissipator, and +100 thermal stability improver.  The Army does not currently have an established kit with a primary purpose to identify these additi ves in the field. The APTK shall be operable by a MOS 92F, fuel handler.  The APTK shall provide the user with a green/amber/red indication of the acceptability of a bulk fuel supply.  It shall operate on 24-volt power that is readily available from vehicles or ground equip ment.  The single suitcase sized container is fully transportable by one soldier.  The PTK shall be primarily used at the Brig ade and Battalion levels.  The PTK will not replace a fully capable laboratory.  It shall have the ability to determine if a source of bulk fuel that has been previously tested by a fully capable petroleum laboratory is still suitable for use as well as pr ovide a maintenance check for the filter-separators.   RATIONALE: U. S. Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) has initiated an operational requirements document (ORD) for an advanced Petroleum Test Kit.  The ORD was approved in January 2003.  CASCOM has identified the APTK requirements in response to the Armys tra nsformation to the Modular Force and its need for a lighter, more portable, easier to operate test kit than is provided within the current inventory.    RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the Market Survey are requested no later than 11 March 2005. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC.  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following format:  Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft PowerPoint.  The maximum size of each e-mail messa ge should be no more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, etc., as well as [Organization Name] response to DEV-2005-04.   All interested entities (e. g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes), regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Partnering with other entities to collaborate and provide the maximum amount of capability for this endeavor i s encouraged.   Please submit electronic responses to survey as well as industry questions for clarification to Corinna Womack via email at Corinna.womack@us.army.mil .  All questions for clarification and responses to those questions will be posted to PROC-NET (contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm) Market Survey DEV-2005-04. GENERAL INFORMATION:  Please mark any document or information submitted as Proprietary, as you feel appropriate.  We appreciate your interest and thank you in advance for your participation in this market survey.

<DESC>Potential offerors are responsible for acknowledging all amendments to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

The purpose of this amendment is to remove FAR Clause 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies (JUNE 2003); FAR Provision 52.225-2, Buy American Act Certificate (JUNE 2003); and DFAR Clause 252.225-7001, Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program (APR 2003); and incorporate by reference DFAR Clause 252.225-7021 Trade Agreements (JAN 2005), and in full text, DFAR Provision 252.225-7020 Trade Agreements Certificate (JAN 2005).  

In addition, the following questions and answers are provided for the information of all potential offerors:

17.  Clarification to Q&A #7 and #15 - Power for "Racks" - If the actual "racks" require power (for a fan, other?), please provide the requirements in order to size the UPS properly.  Are the racks being provided as GFE?  The racks will not be provided as GFE as previously stated.  We expect all potential offerors to have the ability to develop their total VoIP solution power requirements since the potential offerors “should” know the power requirements of the components that they are recommending. 
 
18.  Clarification to Q&A #8 (ref. 2.6) - Call Accounting System - Is a call accounting system needed for each RSC or does DIA require one for the entire network? Each RSC must have the capability to view and analysis call detail records. 
 
19.  What is the expected date of contract award? On or about 11 March 2005
 
20.  Please provide the model number of the Tandberg H.323 endpoints for requirement 3.2. Tandberg 1000
 
21.  Requirement 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 – Maintenance - What is the “term” of the desired maintenance support? Annual
 
22.  Requirement 3.5 – Is this annual maintenance for all equipment on a “parts only” basis? The requirement is clear.  For example, if the IP PBX should have failure due to a software or hardware problem, then the annual maintenance should include support telephonic and on-site support to fix as required. 
 
23.  Requirement 3.6 – Is the specialized, on-site 3-hour response time on a time and materials basis? Please explain. Yes. 
 
24.  Requirement 2.1 System Requirements – Can DIA provide a definition of GA (Generally Available) as referenced in Section 2.1? GA (Generally Available) software releases and hardware are mature and stable, having successfully passed through all earlier release stages and proven themselves through widespread use to be very reliable and bug/problem free. 
 
25.  Our review of the solicitation revealed technical requirements contemplate use of the VoIP system in a manner which requires compliance with Section 353 of Public Law 107-314, “Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003” (December 2, 2002) (the “FY03 National Defense Authorization Act” or “Section 353”), Department of Defense (“DoD) Instruction (“DoDI”) 8100.3, and Department of Defense Voice Networks Generic Switching Center Requirements (“GSCR”) (September 8, 2003).   However, there is a lack of discussion in the solicitation of the requirement for certification and accreditation required pursuant to DoDI 8100.3.  Please specify the level of certification and accreditation required.  The DoDIIS Voice over IP (VoIP) implementation planned by DIA is intended only to meet intelligence requirements for the DoD Intelligence community and will not connect to the DSN, the DRSN, or the PSTN. Consequently, Section 353 of Public Law 107-314 and DoDI 8100.3 do not apply to the DoDIIS VoIP implementation.

<DESC>SUBJECT: 	Request For Quotations (RFQ) No. M-OAA-GRO-EGAS – 1001, Amendment No. 2 to RFQ posted on FedBizOps (WWW.FBO.GOV) of February 02, 2005
Event/Meeting Planner services in support of the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid (ACVFA).

The purpose of this amendment is provide answers to questions and to extend the Closing Date.

The Closing Date is amended as follows:
Change From:  February 17, 2005 (4:00 P.M.)
To Read:  February 19, 2005 (1:00 P.M.) 

Question 1:  What is sought from an event/meeting planner in terms of the cost proposal?  

Answer 1:  The cost proposal is to be evaluated based on the proposed fixed prices for Items 001 and 002.  The contractor will procure the best possible pricing for Item 003 after award, within an established budget subject to the Cognizant Technical Officer’s (CTO) approval.  No G&A burden or other indirect costs can be applied to Item 003 cost reimbursable costs.  Any indirect costs, profit or fee anticipated must be included in Item 001 and Item 002 only as the proposed prices.

Question 2:  Will meeting planning involvement be restricted to just reimbursement of travel arrangements made by members on their own?  

Answer 2: In terms of the travel, the Members may be given the option of working with a designated travel agent but many prefer to work with their own agent or buy tickets on their own.  The meeting planner should hold a block of rooms in reasonable proximity to the conference facility with the approval of the CTO for a period of time so that the Members get the better rate.  Guidance is given for using economy class and most direct flight.  
  
Question 3: Has event planning support for these meetings been sought through solicitations in the past? If so, which company/organization conducted them?

Answer 3: The current contractor for these services is the The Webster Group, Inc.  

Question 4: The solicitation mentions "...travel reimbursements for ACVFA members (5 to 10 individuals) who do not reside in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area".  Does this mean that the only travel related expenses in the cost proposal should be for about 20 ACVFA members combined for the two executive sessions on May 19 and October 20 (and no travel for the public meetings)?

Answer 4:  The members come into town for both the public meeting and the executive session (e.g. May 18 for the public meeting and May 19 for the exec. session) so the travel needs to be planned accordingly.

Question 5:  How many events do you have in a year?

Answer 5:  Two more meetings are scheduled for 2005 not including the one this month.

Question 6:   Is there a form SF 1449 that is required with the submission?

Answer 6:  No.

Question 7: For all dinners, do you want suggestions of restaurants or have these already 
been chosen?  Will the planner also be suggesting locations for the conference facility?

Answer 7:  Restaurant and menus for the Members’ dinner suggestions and conference 
facility suggestions will be required after award as well as scheduling and coordinating.  

Question 8:    Are AV requirements the same for the Public Meeting as well as the 
Members Meeting?

Answer 8:  AV requirements as stated are primarily for the public meeting; we may from 
time to time need a power point but this is not foreseen.  The Members’ Meeting is a
more informal discussion among the members with USAID staff attending as invited.

Question 9:  Can the Plenary session room be used as one of the breakout rooms?

Answer 9:  The plenary session room could be used as one of the breakout rooms.

Question 10:  The ACFVA Members meeting is suggested as either the same day of the 
breakout meeting from 3- 6pm or the following day.  The public meeting is from 8am – 
6pm, how could the meeting be on the same day?

Answer 10:  Sometimes, the public meeting ends at 3 pm whereby the executive session 
can then be held the same day.  

Question 11:   Is there a cost for the public meeting?

Answer 11: No

Question 12:  How many meeting presenters are there?  Is the planner having any 
responsibility for the meeting presenters?

Answer 12:  The number of meeting presenters has averaged ten.  The planner's 
responsibility pertains to such things as the presenters' name badges, their attendance at 
the ACVFA Members luncheon, and any special AV needs (coordinating their power 
point presentation).

Question 13:  Submissions of Development Experience Documentation (AIDAR Clause 
752.7005) – Should anything be sent to the Development Experience Clearinghouse?

Answer 13:  Any documents would be sent after award to The Development Experience Clearinghouse, however they should not be contacted in any event since this clause is inapplicable to the RFQ requirement and can be ignored.

Question 14:  What is the timing of the payment for cost reimbursement for these items?        

Answer 14: Following the completion of Item 001, the fixed amount for Item 001 can be invoiced along with the costs associated with Item 003.  The Prompt Payment Act requires payment within 30 days.
 
Question 15:  What are the set up and audio visual requirements for the four small workgroups?  

Answer 15:  The four small workgroups may require the same as the plenary session.

Question 16: Do you require a certified court reporter or may we use a professional scientific and medical writer/editor to complete verbatim transcription? 
 
Answer 16:  A court reporter is preferred.

Question 17:  What type of room set up is required for the Executive Sessions?  What is the Meeting Set-up for the ACFVA (Members only) meeting?  

Answer 17:  Public Meeting Set-Up:  Theater is expected but if a small crowd is expected it may be Classroom Set-Up.  For the Members only Executive Session meeting a “Hollow Square is preferred.

Question 18:  Are we required to book sleeping rooms at government rate?  

Answer 18:  The best rates available are sought.

Question 19:  How many names will be included in the data base for the post card and flyer mailings? 
 
Answer 19: The data base is currently 1600 names and growing for the save the date cards and the flyer.

Question 20:  Is the progress report required at 100% of the completed work part of the debriefing with CTO at one week post-meeting? 
            
Answer 20:  Yes.

Question 21:  Do any locally residing members require sleeping rooms? 
 
Answer 21:  No.

Question 22:  Is there any flexibility on meeting dates? 

Answer 22:  Any flexibility is on the CTO’s part, however the present schedule is expected to hold and will only change if there is an unforeseen problem.

Question 23:  What is a Rapporteur”?

Answer 23:  A rapporteur takes notes, reads handouts, and oversees the verbatim 
recording (by tape or stenotype).  The rapporteur then provides a meeting report/minutes.  Visiting the ACVFA web site contains past reports:  http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/

Question 24:  The SOW states, “website will be created and managed by the CTO, in coordination with the meeting planner”.  Please delineate the duties.   Also, who will host the website, e.g., ACVFA or contractor? 

Answer 24:  This is a USAID web site so the CTO will "host" -- online registration emails come to her and are automatically forwarded to the meeting planner.
