The proposed contract will prov ide technical and professional personnel for operations, maintenance, repair and minor construction/alteration of real property facilities to include Family Housing and equipment in place.  The performance period is 01 April 2005 through 30 September 2005.   The follow on action for these services is currently in Phase I evaluation.  This extension is necessary due to delays in the acquisition process for the follow on contract.  This proposed contract extension would provide continued performance for the th ird and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.  The third and fourth quarters historically have been the busiest and critical performance period under this contract.   Pyramid is the current installation support contractor performing the services and it is no t reasonable to expect any other contractor to be able to mobilize and be able to provide continuity of services during this period.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.   This no tice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government will consider all proposals received within 30 days of the publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon r esponses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Range Instrumentation Systems Squadron (RISS), Air Combat Support Systems Group (ACSSG), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB FL, plans to issue a sole source contract to DRS Training and Control Systems, Inc. (formerly Metric Systems Corporation), 645 NW Anchors St, Fort Walton Beach, FL, using proprietary hardware and software to produce an Air Combat Training System (ACTS) Airborne Instrumentation Subsystem (AIS) emulator to support aircraft integration efforts. The ACTS emulator (ACTSE) will provide RISS with the capability to accomplish end-to-end testing of an ACTS AIS pod. The minimum ACTSE requirements are an integrated portable computer with F-15 and F-16 aircraft integration test stations to obtain radar track files and other information along with existing and planned ACTS AIS pod data link receivers/transmitters.

The purpose of the ACTSE is to validate the performance of the AIS unit under test (UUT) by providing realistic target position information and other required data to the UUT. The ACTSE will allow technical assessment of the performance of the UUT to determine the accuracy and validity of various ACTS weapon simulations. The contractor shall provide the computer, required software and hardware, interface cables, an operator’s manual, and operator training (5 operators). The portable computer shall have an internal Global Positioning System (GPS) and capability to simultaneously monitor and record data from two MIL-STD-1553 data buses for up to four hours. The ACTSE must operate with unclassified and classified data. An ACTSE data link receiver/transmitter unit shall also be required. The ACTSE shall simulate at least 4 AIS participants for the UUT. The contractor shall also provide standard commercial protective containers to transport the ACTSE. The ACTSE shall be lightweight (less than 50 pounds) and easily transported. Maximum external dimensions shall be 2 feet X 2 feet X by 1 foot high. Color is optional. Any interested companies should submit a statement of capabilities to the Procuring Contracting Officer, Jennifer Martin, via electronic mail at jennifer.martin@eglin.af.mil.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<CONTACT>1Lt John Kendall, Contract Manager, 781-377-3904 Dorothy Febbi, Contracting Officer, 781-377-6679
<DESC>The Joint STARS Program Office of the Electronic Systems Center (ESC/JSSA) is seeking sources for the acquisition of the CNS/ATM modification to the Joint STARS E-8C Weapon System Trainers (WSTs).  A new CNS/ATM upgrade to the E-8C aircraft fleet has been initiated through the Northrop Grumman Corporation Joint STARS System Improvement Program (JSSIP) contract, with the Rockwell Collins Corporation as the major subcontractor for CNS/ATM components.  This E-8C upgrade encompasses the worldwide changes in Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts, developed to safely achieve increased air traffic density goals.  These upgrades have resulted in changes to national and international requirements for aircraft Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  These concepts, requirements, and implementations, collectively referred to as CNS/ATM, previously known in the military as Global Air Traffic Management (GATM), necessitate modification to civil, commercial, and military aircraft, as well as the Air Traffic Control (ATC) infrastructure.  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA) have begun to implement new air traffic architecture to meet this need. In addition, United States Air Force (USAF) safety improvement mandates, such as use of predictive wind shear, are directly related to the CNS/ATM effort.<br> In order to operate in both domestic and international airspace, the E-8C Joint STARS aircraft must be upgraded to satisfy CNS/ATM specifications. Those requirements are already being implemented throughout the world and non-compliance results in operational restrictions and associated impacts. The CNS/ATM environment transitions to satellite-based GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation with increased reliance on digital data links rather than voice for pilot/controller communication in oceanic/remote airspace, as well as en-route and in terminal environments. The CNS/ATM environment improves surveillance by enhancing both ground and flight deck situational awareness through improved communications and electronic displays.<br> This effort will upgrade the WSTs that are located at Warner - Robins AFB, GA, that are used to train the E-8C Joint STARS flight crews. This ground training is rigorous and saves significant air flight costs, by thoroughly orienting the flight crew before their E-8C flights.  As each significant modification is made to the E-8 C, it is implemented in the WSTs prior to fleet modification, thus increasing crew proficiency greatly.  The WST has been a long-range program initiated in the early 1990's after an award of a competitive contract to the Rockwell Collins Corporation.  To date the development of the 2 WSTs and the subsequent modifications have obligated over $27M in funding through Aeronautical Systems Center's contract with Rockwell Collins, and developed a unique and premier E-8C simulation and training system.  These trainers have been developed since 1994, and have undergone numerous modifications since delivery to Warner - Robins AFB. The major components of the CNS/ATM upgrade for both the Joint STARS E-8 C and WSTs are based on commercial products produced by the Rockwell Collins Corporation at Cedar Rapids, IA.  The WSTs are currently already in use for training and one cannot be removed from the training schedule to allow for study, examination, and teardown by any contractor.  On the basis of the history of the WST Program, the Electronic Systems Center intends to issues a Request for Proposal only to Rockwell Collins via the WR-ALC Rockwell Collins Partnership Corporate Contract.  The statutory authority to do so is 10 U.S.C. 230 (c) (1) which states the following: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one source, or from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."  However, if a firm believes it can meet the WST requirements that firm should submit a statement of qualifications that demonstrates that they can provide technically compliant upgrade to the WSTs at WR-ALC.   The statement of qualification is limited to 50 pages, and text should be 12-font Arial, and graphics should have no smaller than 10-font test.  Statements should be submitted within 15 days of the publication of this notice, to the buyer, Lt. John Kendall, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2119.  Commercial brochures will not be accepted.    The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to ESC. Without written permission from the respondent, ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked "Proprietary". This synopsis is for planning and information purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate approach.  The Government will solicit the firms meeting the screening criteria listed below.  Any interested firm initially judged to be unqualified will be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request.  Any offer submitted by such a firm will be evaluated without prejudice. <br><br> The CNS/ATM modification to the E-8C Joint STARS Weapon System Trainers will include the following. <br> a.	Sample flight crew training functions affected by the upgrade of the WSTs with the E-8 are<br> 1)	Perform Preflight Inspection checklists. <br> 2)	Evaluate Mission System Status<br> 3)	Monitor and Control Systems to Achieve Mission Tasking/Objectives<br> 4)	Interpret Navigation data<br> 5)	Log Key Air Request Data on Mission Log<br> 6)	Monitor Mission Crew Preparations<br> 7)	 Perform After Landing and Before Leaving Aircraft Checklists<br> 8)	Respond to actual emergency situation<br> b.	Integration with the ongoing upgrade of the WSTs with the Terminal Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS).  TCAS will be completed in the WSTs in 2006 and form a basis for the CNS/ATM modification to the WSTs, just as it is in the actual E-8C. <br> In addition to addressing the above technical issues, the statement of capabilities should address the following: (1) Name and address of the firm; (2) Size of business (Does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business or a small, disadvantaged business? If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? Is your firm is a woman-owned or operated business?)  (3) Ownership (particularly foreign ownership of partial ownership; (4) Year firm established; (5) Names of two principals to contact, including title and telephone number; (6) Company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office locations, DUNS number, if 8(a), date of acceptance into Small Business Administration 8(a) program and anticipated graduation date; (7) Resources available such as corporate management and currently-employed personnel to be assigned to the project to include names and current job titles; (8) Management approach to staffing the total effort with qualified personnel, based on past staffing plans.  The staffing plan should address any new hires that would be available for assignment to this effort, possible subcontract/teaming arrangements, and strategy for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel; (9) A description of previous experience that demonstrates your firm's ability to effectively manage or perform a similar effort; (10) A description of clearance level - respondents must have a Top Secret clearance; (11) Past experience with Boeing 707 type airframes and its subsystems, e.g. 1553 Data Buses, CNS/ATM Systems, Trainers and simulator for Aircraft, Antennas, cockpit displays, SATCOM Links and intelligence links.  Only include information about on-going contract(s) or contract(s) completed within the last five years that have relevant past experience.  Required specific information for each effort is: (a) Name of Contracting Activity; (b) Contract Number; (c) Contract Type (FFP, Cost, IDIQ, or combination); (d) Period of Performance, Total Contract Value, and Total Dollar Value under the Contract that the firm was actually responsible for under this NAICS code; (e) Summary of contract work; (f) Contracting Officer name and current telephone number; (g) Contracting Officers Technical Representative name and current telephone number; (h) List of major subcontractors including name, address, and telephone numbers of primary points of contact. (12) Respondents must have a certified cost accounting system, certified pricing system, and certified estimating system.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida (NSWC PC), intends to award a firm fixed price sole&#64979;source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Wolfpac Technologies, Inc. of Orlando, FL for specialized support in the development, execution, and analysis of statistically sound electronic based customer and stakeholder surveys, in support of NSWC PC transformation initiatives and the NSWC PC Balanced Scorecard. Support will be for a base year with an option for a second year at a reduced level of effort. This purchase has been determined to be a valid requirement for a certified HUBZONE firm. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Wolfpac Technologies, Inc., a certified small veteran owned HUBZONE business, will be tasked by the NSWC PC for support in conducting analyses regarding the manner in which the NSWC PC can acquire statistically valid customer and stakeholder feedback specificall! y related to the NSWC PC Balanced Scorecard and transformation efforts within the sphere of future littoral warfare and coastal operations initiatives. Wolfpac Technologies, Inc. is the only HUBZONE source available with the unique blend of capabilities and experience in State and Local Government processes, Department of the Navy vision and development processes, and knowledge of NAVSEA and NSWC PC to successfully complete the tasks required for accomplishment under this purchase order. Wolfpac Technologies possesses unique capabilities in the realms of information technology, information assurance, information management practices utilizing advanced technologies as well as an in-depth knowledge of  developing and conducting statistically valid electronic web based surveys that are required to successfully accomplish this effort. The unique knowledge resident within Wolfpac Technologies, Inc. within these areas of expertise provides a knowledge base that would require an ex! tensive learning program (and thus additional and unnecessary cost and time to the Government) by any other vendor. Award will be based on the written quotation. The anticipated award date will be on or about Mar 31, 2005.Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida, 32407-7001. Period of performance will be twelve (12 ) months from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 541618 applies. SBA Size Standard is $23M. FSC is 9999.

NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Microbotics, Inc. at 28 Research Drive, Suite G, Hampton, Virginia 23666. The fundamental nature of this procurement is to buy components to build flight hardware that duplicates or improves upon existing systems.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on __March 12, 2005_______________. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The USCG Engineering Logistics Center intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for the repair of electronic equipment in accordance with OEM standards.   This agreement will support our existing contract, DTCG40-00-D-70002, with Sunair Electronics, 3005 S.W. Third Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315-3389.   Under the current contract Sunair is converting the RT9000A HF Transceiver Radios, RCU-9310A Remote Control Units, CU-9125 100 Watt Coupler and F-9800 Pre/Post Selector to Revision B.  This requires that the equipment be in operational order before being converted, which sometimes requires the equipment to be repaired beforehand.  To save funding, logistical problems and avoid stop gaps in the replacement process, our office intends to establish a BPA with Sunair to repair the equipment so that we can have it converted while the material is still at their facility once repaired.  Contractor will be requested to provide a price for open/inspect/report.  Upon completion of inspection, contractor shall provide a detailed report identifying the parts and the costs associated with repairing the item, i.e. labor hours and parts.  Inspection costs and labor rates (loaded) will be established in the resulting BPA. Interested sources that possess the capabilities to repair these items can submit the following information: (1) complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics) or 2) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturered for the government or the original equipment manufacturer. Interested sources shall submit this information to our office within 7 days of this announcement. The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of a contract.  The complete solicitation package shall be available for download from FedBizOpps, at www.eps.gov on or about 2 March 2004. Be advised this is an estimated date, interested parties are encouraged to review FedBizOpps daily unit the quotation becomes available.

<DESC>This is a request for information for a commercial item in accordance with the FAR 12.6 and 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling urgency.  No proposals are requested by this announcement all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials.  
The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this request for information.

Objective:  The United States Department of Commerce seeks to acquire more information related to products that would be used as respiratory protection during a chemical or biological agent exposure.  Specifically, there exists an interest in Escape Respiratory Protection that would be used for personnel that will be acting as floor monitors in order to assist employees from the building during an evacuation.  Monitors must be able to communicate with both the employees they are directing and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  The second group would be children from the DOC Child Care Center.  Children do not need to communicate, however the respiratory protection product must be able to accommodate infants through pre-schoolers.  As a baseline, the contemplated product must allow greater levels of protection that are equal to or better than NIOSH or SBCCOM certification (if one exists).  EOC Respiratory Protection for personnel who provide command and control though-out the facility for extended periods (up to full shift usage) during a chemical or biological agent exposure.  These individuals use telephones and radios to communicate so any respiratory protection equipment provided must have a minimal impact on communication.  This equipment must accommodate one size fits all and not require a fit test, or a medical evaluation for use.  As a baseline, the respiratory protection equipment must provide levels of protection that are equal to or better than NIOSH or SBCCOM certification.  


Technical/Functional Requirements: Provided below are some of the salient features of the respiratory protection product for floor monitors:

Not interfere with the ability to wear eyeglasses and does not require the wearer to be clean-shaven or interfere with oral communication.  Escape protection must be readily adaptable to children.  Provide protection against common organic compounds and particles that could result from a Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN), fire or natural event.  Products for both groups must provide short duration protection for building escape or evacuation.  Have NIOSH, SBCCOM, or equivalent certification or approval.  Have training units available.

Emergency Operations Center respiratory protection will:
Have minor impact on communication, allowing wearer to use telephones and radios.
Provide protection against common organic compounds and particles that could result from a CBRN, fire, or natural event.
Provide extended use, i.e. up to full shift usage.
Have the fewest requirements for use, i.e., fit testing, medical evaluation, and one size fits all is preferred.
Have NIOSH, SBCOMM, or equivalent certification or approval.


Instructions to Offerors:  This request for information is issued solely for informational purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to a contract.  Further, the Department of Commerce is not seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data.  Industry organizations are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the industry organization.  All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.  Further, within your capability statement please include your business status i.e., whether your company is a small or large business and if your company holds a GSA schedule.  Responses should be 2-10 pages, 10, or 12 fonts.  Responses are requested by 2-25-2005.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: Potential Sources Sought. This is not an RFP. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting as market survey to identify potential sources that can provide the technical expertise for the Highway for LIFE program in accordance with the Scope of Work herein.

Highways for LIFE Program Support Contract(s)
Background

As proposed, Highways for LIFE is a pilot program to greatly accelerate the rate at which innovations are put into practice in the highway community.  Toward this end, the program vision is to widely demonstrate dramatic improvement in the American driving experience.  This vision is supported by three strategic objectives:  
·	Improve safety
·	Reduce congestion due to construction 
·	Improve quality

Technologies and practices needed to make highways safer, reduce congestion due to construction and provide longer lasting highways have been developed and proven.  However, too many of these technologies and practices remain underutilized in an industry that is accustomed to slow evolution.  The strategy conceived to achieve the outcome defined by the Highways for LIFE vision and goals is founded on the following principles and elements:

·	Active involvement of highway community stakeholders in determining how these 	goals will be achieved.
·	Performance standards that establish high expectations with regard to safety during 	construction and over the life of the  new or rehabilitated facility, congestion caused by 	construction, and quality
·	Investment in: 
·	Highway construction projects in which State Departments of Transportation strive to achieve the Highways for 	LIFE Performance Standards through the application of innovative technologies and 	practices
·	Technology partnerships with industry to accelerate the rate at which proven 	technologies are put into practice in highway construction and broaden participation 	in Highways for LIFE
·	An extensive program of technology transfer and information dissemination to 	educate and equip personnel at all levels and in all sectors of the highway community 	with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively apply the best available 	technologies and practices to meet the challenges of 21st century highway 	construction.
·	Monitoring and evaluation of all components of the Highways for LIFE program to 	provide the information needed to achieve maximum effectiveness and measure 	success.

Through this strategy FHWA would work with the highway community and stakeholders to bring about a leap forward in highway design and construction practices, and initiate a new culture that seeks out and embraces new technologies and practices.

Bringing the Highways for LIFE concept to fruition will require active involvement on the part of many of the FHWA headquarters and field offices and will also require extensive contractor support for activities such as development and delivery of training and technical assistance; development of a knowledge system; a Lead States program; workshops on Highways for LIFE tools, technologies, or projects; marketing and communications; database development, data collection, and monitoring to support the evaluation of individual Highways for LIFE projects and program components as well as assessment of overall program success.  

Contractor personnel are needed to support the work of Highways for LIFE Team and other FHWA staff involved in Highways for LIFE activities on an as-needed basis.  The broad types of work that may be required can be defined at this time, but the overall level of effort that will be required, and the distribution of  that effort among the activities provided for under this procurement are uncertain and subject to change pending the conclusion of reauthorization and annual appropriations legislation.  

Full implementation of the proposed Highway for LIFE Pilot program and rapid realization of the potential benefits are dependent upon the inclusion of specific program funding in the pending highway reauthorization legislation. The final scope and scale of the program will depend on the outcome of the pending highway reauthorization process. However, a more incremental approach to the program goals is both feasible and appropriate within FHWA’s existing authority and programs.  FHWA is committed to pursuit of Highways for LIFE to the extent feasible.  Information about Highways for LIFE is available at www.fhwa.dot.gov/rnt4u.

Scope of Work/Areas of Activity

The CECOM Acquisition Center does not itend to award a contract on the basis of your reponses nor ot herwise pay for the preparations of any information presented or the use of any such information. All proprietary information should be marked as such.  The response date for this RFI is April 01, 2005. For Technical Point of Contact is Mr. Robert Burrus, Phone 732-427-0772 or E-mail robert.burrus@mail1.monmouth.army.mil The US Army PM Firefinder currently manages an aging target acquisition counter fire radar system AN/TPQ-36(V) 8.  The EQ-36 System would provide improved operational and physical functionality over the existing AN/TPQ-36(V) 8 radar.  The EQ-36 System must  have increase accuracy and range, be an affordable, highly mobile and transportable ruggedized battlefield radar system with improved throughput, reduced crew size (four), and fewer vehicles.  Phase I of the EQ-36 program will emphasize radar performance in a 90 degree sector coverage pattern.  The 90 degree search sector shall be capable of being moved and steered through the 6400 mil sector without repositioning the vehicle and/or trailer on which the antenna is mounted.  The width of the search sector s hall be operator selectable from 230 mils to 1600 mils.  A spiral development program is planned to ultimately increase the search sector to a 360 degree coverage capability.  The Phase 1 the system designs and equipment architecture shall ensure a cost ef fective path forward of the 360 degree capability.  The EQ-36 System shall collect, process, store, display, and digitally transmit day/night mortar, cannon, and rocket counter-fire target acquisition data to the controlling Command and Control (C2) archit ecture via Combat Net Radio and LAN.  Stored data shall also be able to be transmitted manually, automatically, and, while on the move, using two-way digital communications.  The EQ-36 System architecture shall emphasize Built In Test (BIT), and embedded t raining to ensure ease of Soldier operation and maintenance in the field.  The EQ-36 System radar shall be capable of supporting forces in most operational environments to include urban and complex clutter/terrain, and be ruggedized to operate in these env ironments.  The system shall incorporate self locating/self survey capabilities/techniques that provide sufficient Northing, Easting, and Altitude (N,E,A) grid coordinate accuracy to ensure that the target location requirements as specified in Table 1 are met.  The EQ-36 shall also be capable of accepting survey data (N,E,A and direction) through manual download.  Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED levels 1 and 2) and meteorological data shall be used and easily imported into the system.  Radar system arc hitecture shall not preclude the use of higher levels of DTED.  Weapon classification shall be as light, medium or heavy subtypes and caliber as a goal.  The secondary mission is to provide accurate 'did hit' data of artillery, cannon, and rocket friendly fires.  'State Vectors' for targets shall be available for transmission.  It is desired that the system complete the basic elements of transmitting, receiving, processing, and digital target reporting within 10 seconds (current Message Transfer Protocol St andards) of weapon firing.  It is envisioned that the EQ-36 System will have at least two hardware configurations to ensure functional operation in all threat environments while maintaining an efficient and safe environment for the soldier.  A 'mission ess ential' configuration is required to accomplish a rapid insertion of the EQ-36 System by a single C-130 sortie.  Rapid emplacement/displacement and mobility of the system to support initial insertions is required.  A second 'sustainment' configuration is e nvisioned to be used for mid to long term protection of high priority assets (like air ports, command posts, etc.) and requires a shelter that provides crew protection against ballistic nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons.  The shelter shall be equipped with an ECU (environmental control unit) and a GPFU (gas particulate filter u nit).  Phase 1 of the EQ-36 Program will develop and deliver the 'mission essential' configuration and develop the system designs and equipment architecture to ensure a cost effective implementation of the 'sustainment' configuration to be implemented and delivered in Phase II of the program.  For each configuration it is mandatory that the EQ-36 System be hardened to protect against loss of critical platform functionality after exposure to physical destructive threats from conventional explosive ordnance, and to non-conventional ordnance (NBC weapons).  The system shall also be able to withstand nuclear effects from HEMP (High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse) and high power microwave radiation.  The EQ-36 System shall be operable and maintainable by personne l wearing MOPP IV gear and be able to withstand decontamination.  The EQ-36 System shall be able to perform its missions in an electronic warfare environment and operate with minimal adverse effects or system degradation.  The EQ-36 System shall be able to  operate in blackout mode without degrading normal operations. For complete specifications and additional information please go to the following website: https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ Go to the Army Pre-Award Drop Down box, select CECOM Market Research and press the Go button. From the market research listing select 'Enhanced AN/TPQ-36 Counter Fire Radar (EQ-36)'. Next scroll down and select the attachment titled 'EQ-36 RFI Final Feb 23  05'.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Division intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis for the acquisition of Navy Marine Corps Video Teletraining Support Services for the Naval Education Training Command (NETC), Pensacola, FL. The services will be accomplished through a modification extending the performance period under the existing contract N00140-01-C-0986.  The extension will consist of a 2-month period (01 April 2005 through 31 May 2005). The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Applied Global Technologies, 5575 South U.S.1, Rockledge, FL 32955), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplier or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this extension is to allow sufficient time to complete the procurement process for the competitive follow-on contract.  The applicable NAICS code is 541512 with a size standard of $21,000,000. The Government intends to acquire the services from Applied Global Technologies since they are the only source that currently has the personnel and the infrastructure in place to perform the requisite services by 1 April 2005 without the phase-in period that would be required from a different source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The follow-on requirement to N00140-00-C-0986 was synopsized on 02 Nov. 2004 under RFP number N00140-05-R-0009. The RFP was issued on 09 Dec. 2004, closed on 02 Feb 2005 and is currently under evaluation.

<SUBJECT>--DACA78-99-D-0003: Extending Performance Period of Balkans Support Contract for Logistical Support Services to U.S. Forces
<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate an extension of the Balkans Support Contract (BSC) with Kellogg, Brown and  Root Services (KBRS) for continuation of a full range of temporary construction and logistical support services to the U.S. Forces in the Balkans region (e.g. Hungary, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia). The incumbent contractor provides logistical suppo rt for contingency operations and periodic U.S. military exercises.  Services provided include, but are not limited to, troop housing and facilities, food services, laundry service operations, base camp and equipment maintenance, shuttle bus and transporta tion services, road repair/maintenance, snow and ice removal, railhead operation, water production and distribution, and cargo and material handling services for the troops that are located in different areas under the Balkans cost reimbursable award fee c ontract.  The extension will be for a period of one year, from May 1, 2005 through April 30, 2006, with two option periods from May 1, 2006 through October 31, 2006 and from November 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007.  Competition for the USAREUR Support Co ntract (USC), which will replace the BSC, is currently under way, utilizing full and open competition.  However, the USC is not expected to be in place prior to the expiration of the BSC.  Accordingly, the Government seeks to extend the BSC to ensure conti nuity of essential services until the USC contract has been awarded and the USC contractor is ready to perform. Once the USC is in place, the Government intends to place orders for necessary services under the USC.  For the periods of extension described a bove, only the incumbent contractor will be able to successfully meet the contract requirements cost effectively within the time required to assure uninterrupted continuation of necessary services, with minimum risk to the health and safety of the troops.  The incumbent contractor has successfully performed within the laws and regulations of the different countries in which contract services are required, including obtaining necessary licenses; has experience performing similar services within an unstable c ontingency environment; possesses security clearances and access badges for experienced and qualified local employees; has demonstrated the necessary financial capability; has negotiated necessary subcontracts; and has negotiated necessary agreements with local governmental entities.  Uninterrupted contractor performance is critical to mission execution and soldier support.  The Government does not anticipate that any contractor other than the incumbent would be mobilized and ready to provide these critical  services by May 1, 2005.  The incumbent is the only contractor able to meet the Governments requirements without causing unacceptable delay to sensitive missions.  In addition to unacceptable delay, award to any other source would result in substantial d uplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

****LINE ITEM 0001: Liquid Helium Cryostat meeting the following required specifications:

**Cryostat shall have a liquid helium hold time not less than 2 weeks on a single fill when the optical ports are blanked-off and there is no wiring. The liquid helium capacity shall be at least 4 liters. The liquid helium cryostat shall be capable of evacuation down to 24 Torr while containing liquid helium. There is no hold time requirement liquid helium is below atmospheric pressure.

**Cryostat shall have a liquid nitrogen reservoir with a hold time of at least 36 hours. The nitrogen capacity shall be at least 4 liters;

**Cryostat shall have a 4 K, gold plated work surface of at least 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter with holes containing stainless steel threading for a screw of size number 6 (or M4) or larger. The work surface shall have perpendicular free space (head room) of at least 2.5 inches (63.5 mm). The work surface and perpendicular free space shall constitute a working volume.  The working volume shall be enclosed by two nested radiation shields, one attached to the liquid He stage and one attached to the liquid N2 stage. These radiation shields shall be fasted to their respective stages such that their temperatures are not more than 20K higher than their respective stages under typical operating conditions.

**Cryostat shall have an additional single-layer radiation shield in between the liquid nitrogen and liquid helium stages. This shield does not need to enclose the working volume;

**All materials within the cryostat shall be compatible with high vacuum (10^-6 Torr). For example, intermediate radiation shields shall not be made of metalized polyimide. In addition the vacuum space shall contain no gettering material.

**All enclosed volumes shall be vented to allow efficient pump down of the vacuum space. All blind tapped holes in vacuum shall be vented. The working volume and the volume between the liquid N2 and liquid He shall be vented when all optical access ports are blanked off such that light can not pass directly through the vents, with the goal of keeping the working volume background radiation level close to 4 K when all optical access ports are blanked off.

**The vacuum vessel shall have 4 equally spaced optical access side ports able to hold 2 inch (50.8 mm) diameter vacuum windows. The optical axis shall be less than 4 inches (102 mm) from the cryostat bottom (excluding a removable stand). Optical access side ports that are made through any intermediate radiation shielding shall have mounts such that filters and aperture discs can be firmly mounted in them and they shall be made incrementally smaller, such that filters and aperture discs can be removed to the outside without disassembling the cryostat body.  The optical access ports on the liquid He radiation shield surrounding the working volume shall have an optical clearance of no less than 0.5” diameter;

**The Cryostat shall have the following safety features:

a.	A safety relief valve (or blow-off plate) on the vacuum space;
b.	A non-return valve for the helium exhaust;
c.	A non-return valve for the nitrogen exhaust;

**Cryostat shall have an outer body diameter of 12 inches (305 mm) or less, and a body height (excluding stand and pumping ports) of 24 inches (610 mm) or less;

**Delivery of the complete cryostat shall be required in not more than 12 weeks from receipt of order.

<DESC>The White Sands Directorate of Contracting in support of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center intends to award a contract to Securimetrics, 757 Arnold Dr., Suite D, Martinez, CA 94553 on a sole source basis.  The contract is for the development and purc hase of a tethered version of their Portable Iris Enrollment and Recognition (PIER) device.  The PIER was integrated into the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT) developed at the USAIC in 2002 and upgraded to the latest version of PIER in 2003.  The PIER is  a stand alone system.  There is an urgent requirement of enrolling large numbers of persons of interest using a biometrics system in supporting the War on Terrorism.  In order to reduce the cost of the BAT to enable more prolific fielding, USAIC requires a tethered version.  The use of any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that can not be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays.  Interested parties must submit a statement of interes t and qualification no later than 2:00 pm MT on 25 Feb 2005.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The date to respond to this procurement is 09 March 2005.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-Q-625471 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract/s without discussions.  Therefore, offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this procurement is RFP-CAZ-05-023.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document, consequent award, and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-27.  This acquisition is set aside for small business concerns.  The associated NAICS code under this solicitation is 541360 and the size standard is $4 million.  The deliverables for this solicitation include (1) EV Sequence Table I, III; (2) BPS Sequence Table I; (3) Field Keys II, IV, V; (4) Rapid Assessment Report, Great Lakes; (5) Rapid Assessment Report, South Central; (6) Rapid Assessment Report, Southeast; (7) EV Sequence Table VI; (8) BPS Sequence Table VI; (9) Rapid Assessment Report, Northeast; (10) West EDC Map Zone Attribution; (11) EV Sequence Table IV; (12) EV Sequence Table VII; (13) Draft National Legend; (14) Field Keys I, II, VI; (15) Rapid Assessment Report, North Plains; (16) Rapid Assessment Report, Southern Appalachians; (17) Map Legend Workshop, Northern Rockies/Northwest Plains; (18) EV Sequence Table VIII; (19) Map Legend Workshop, Sacrament; (20) Field Key X; (21) Field Key VII, VIII; (22) Field Key IX; (23) EV Sequence Table II, V; (24) EV Sequence Table X; (25) Map Legend Workshop, Portland; (26) EV Sequence Table XI; (27) Field Key XI; (28) EV Sequence Table IX; and (29) Access Database.  This procurement includes a national effort aimed at producing a series of nationally consistent (‘mid-scale’) maps that depict existing vegetation and biophysical settings, and the degree to which current fire/fuels conditions have departed from expected ‘natural’ ranges of variation.  These ‘mid-scale’ maps (both spatial and thematically) are intended to integrate well with more detailed mapped data produced locally (e.g. a national forest level).  The primary aim of the vendor’s work will be to update and document current knowledge in support of mapping existing vegetation and terrestrial biophysical settings.  These maps, produced at 30m-pixel resolution, will be used to provide robust depictions of fire condition class.  Mapping of fire condition class will utilize conceptual state-transition models for each ecological classification unit that qualitatively describes biophysical settings, natural vegetation types, and characteristic successional pathways.  These conceptual models enable mapped comparisons of current vegetation with biophysical setting to determine the degree of departure in current conditions from expected conditions.  The contribution to LANDFIRE will take several principle forms:  (1)  Coordinate with LANDFIRE staff to organize a series of meetings with major map producers and users throughout the United States in effort to form a National Mapping Consortium to collaborate and share costs associated with producing LANDFIRE map products.  (2)  Coordinate ongoing development, description, and diagnostic keys for the map legend of existing vegetation.

<DESC>USUHS would like to emphasize the fact that we may rely more on the services of the future awarded order then we have in the past.  All questions shall be submitted via e-mail no later then Monday, February 28th.  

Listed below are questions that have been asked in reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation for temporary employment services, with the answers.

•	With respect to firms that are on GS schedule, it is mentioned that “this is a request for reduced pricing under FSS Requote Procedure.”  What does it mean by requoting procedures?  ANSWER:  As stated in DFAR 208.404-70 orders that are to be for services and the award amount is expected to exceed $100,00.00, must be placed on a competitive basis.  We are required to seek a price reduction from firms that have current contracts with GSA for these services.
•	Is there a bidder’s list?  ANSWER:  This is a request for quotes, there is not a bidder’s list.
•	What is the abstract of bids from the last competition?  ANSWER:  See Above.
•	Which positions are subject to the Service Contract Act?  ANSWER:  The Service Contract Act does not apply, because we are considering FS schedule pricing.
•	Can vendors who do not have a health and scientific past performance in administrative services still submit a quote?  ANSWER:  This is a smiplified acquisition and we are not required to disclose the weight for different evaluation factors.  A firm will have a good chance of award if multipliers are low and their current customers are happy.  We strongly encourage firms to submit quotes.
•	Will the current contractor be eligible to submit a quote, and will they submit a quote?  ANSWER:  The current contractor is eligible to submit a quote, but it is up to them if they will.
•	Who is the program manager?  ANSWER:  The name of the program manager cannot be released at this time.
•	Can we schedule appointments to meet with the program manager and the contract specialist to discuss our capabilities?  ANSWER:  We are not going to schedule any appointments with vendors.  Please include your capabilities with your quote.
•	Will the IDIQ be awarded to one company or multiple companies?  ANSWER:  It will be awarded to only one company.
•	What are the insurance requirements?  ANSWER:  There are no additional insurance requirements, beyond mandated coverage such as Workman’s Compensation requirements and any other insurance that the contractor feels are necessary for liability.
•	What are the differences of the old Statement of Work compared to the current Statement of Work?  ANSWER:  The only difference from the last SOW compared to the current SOW is that Federal holidays will be paid to the contractor direct.
•	What is the average annual salary?  ANSWER:  The average annual salary is $35,841.37.
•	Does the multiplier apply to the amount paid to the employee, or the real cost of employment?  ANSWER:  The multiplier applies to the hourly rate paid to the employee before any deductions.
•	Are there any leanings towards certain small business types?  ANSWER:  No.
•	Given the requirements of federal contractors to now utilize the new ORCA system of online representations and certifications, is it your requirement to also submit a printed form along with the quote?  ANSWER:  The FAR states that “An offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.”
•	What are the specific skill sets which USUHS requires?  ANSWER:  Will be defined as each position is created.
•	How many background investigations have been required in the past 12 months?  ANSWER:  There have not been any background investigations in the past 12 months.  This is a new requirement.
•	What is the projected start date?  ANSWER:  Depends on how many quotes are submitted, length of analysis, negotiation, etc.  We are tentativly looking at mid-April if this is agreeable with the selected contractor.
•	Can we itemize our pricing per year, or do we quote one rate for the entire three year period?  ANSWER:  Either way is permissable, and we will consider all quotes submitted with either of these methods.
•	The question was asked “What are the current pay rates of each of the employees that we will be picking up if we win this contract?”  Also how many employees are in the categories described in section B?  ANSWER:  I can answer the above question by providing the following information regarding the pay of the current employees:
Section B1:  There are two employees and the average hourly rate is $39.24.
Section B2:  There are twenty-one employees and the average hourly rate is $16.20.
Section B3:  There are three employees and the average hourly rate is $13.74.
Section B4:  There are five employees and the average hourly rate is $20.98.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to allow for Questions & Answers and to extend the due date for quotes through March 3, 2005, 3:00:00 Eastern Standard Time (EST).

QUESTION:
Your bid mentioned bi-polar, is that a system that can output in both a positive and a negative direction? What is the timing duration of each direction?   

ANSWER:
Yes, it should be able to output in both positive and negative directions.  The power supply will be used to operate a superconducting magnet, so it should be able to handle a large inductive load, few henries.  In normal operation, we will ramp the magnet up in 50s, stay up for a few seconds, ramp down and up in 100s (possibly reversing directions), and similar sequences follow.


QUESTION:
Also, your offering stated that you need four quadrants, is that four separate sets of contacts (Anode and Cathode)?

ANSWER:
It should have only two contacts.  Four quadrant means the ability to switch the polarity of voltage and current electronically.  For example, when we first use +15V to ramp the magnet from 0A to +300A (first quadrant), then it can reserve it’s polarity use -15V to ramp the magnet down from 300A to 0A (fourth quadrant).


QUESTION:
Are the 300 amps per quadrant?

ANSWER:
300A will the maximum positive and negative current the power supply will output.  This is true whichever quadrant the power supply will be operated in.  The power supply will be used to operate a superconducting magnet (large inductive loads), and a brief explanation of four quadrant.



All other terms and conditions of this combined synopsis/solicitation remain the same.

<DESC>This modification to the original solicitation is to clarify the evaluation process that will be used in the consideration of all submissions.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies.  Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) - (a) The Govern ment will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) price; (ii) technica l capability to meet the Government requirement; (iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total pr ice for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before  the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Point of Contact is Mr. Phil Huff, U SAMARAA, Ft. Detrick, MD.  Telephone at 301-619-2940; email is Philip.Huff@det.amedd.army.mil.
