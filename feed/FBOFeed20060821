<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Advanced Optics, Pewaukee, WI.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.3, Simplified Acquisition Methods and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the US Army, Program Management Office - Airborne Reconnaissance Low.  The US Army has a need for fused silica optical windows to protect the PeARL imaging systems without a single negative impact and the ability to fully support the War Fighter.  Optical tolerances consistent with diffraction limited performance are required by the imaging system. Changing to an alternate window supplier at this point would add program risk and negatively impact our ability to support the War Fighter efficiently and meet the quick reaction schedule that has been imposed upon the program by the field commanders.  Using an alternate source for optical fused silica windows to support the PeARL imaging system jeopardizes mission support due to the time to develop a working relationship in areas of technical support in the operation of the complex features of the mounting design for the window assemblies, and the unknowns of developing an alternate source.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST September 1, 2006 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Susan Lawson, NBC, GovWorks, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Susan Lawson at Susan.Lawson@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact: Rhoda Parker, Contract Specialist, 505-853-7282; Technical Point of Contact: MSgt Steven Bible, 505-846-4749. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Directorate on behalf of the AFRL DE, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) to Twister B.V. for a supersonic COIL gas/liquid separator for AFRL/DELC at Kirtland AFB, NM. The contemplated effort is to obtain a 6 month contract with an approximate value of $400,000.
BACKGROUND: AFRL/DELC is developing and testing radical new designs for singlet oxygen generators for Chemical Oxygen Iodine Lasers (COIL). A design for a gas/liquid separator would remove the bulk liquid from the gas stream and should also remove a significant portion of vapor phase water, and minimize the residence time of the gas flow through the separator by accelerating the gas to supersonic velocities. Twister B.V. under a cooperative agreement through European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD) provided a modified a supersonic COIL gas/liquid separator. This contract would further modify the COIL to fit AFRL/DELC technical objectives.
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS are as follows: 1) A design for a gas/liquid separator will be optimized using fluid dynamics design codes; 2) The interaction of the mechanical design and the fluid dynamics will be investigated. This will include damping (if required), structural supports, tolerances and dimension (required for machining feasibility); 3) engineering calculations will be performed for all components which are pressurized based upon design pressure, dynamic loads and temperatures; 4) Based upon the optimized design, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations will be performed including all mechanical/machining constraints. The contractor shall deliver conceptual design package which contains all required information to allow AFRL/DELC to develop fabrication drawings. This package shall contain all details necessary to allow for a mechanical designer to create fabrication drawings. A contract will be issued to Twister B.V. provided other sources cannot provide the drawings at equal or better technical capability within the same time-frame as Twister B.V. Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in the areas of subject effort. 3. Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Responses are limited to 15 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected. Submit responses to Rhoda Parker, AFRL/PKDB, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this announcement by 3:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time (MST). The proposed contract action is for performance of research and development for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty (30) calendar days after the publication date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. The determination of the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This is an unrestricted announcement under NAICS code 541710. However, firms should indicate whether they are or not a small business, woman-owned, qualifying 8(a) business, certified HubZone small business, or historically black college, university, and minority institution (HBCU/MI).

<CONTACT>Doug Roark, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5771, Email douglas.roark@dhs.gov
<DESC>Subject:  Request for Information (RFI) for Bottle Screening Devices for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.  General Information: In support of the ongoing effort by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Energy (DOE), as well as the DOE National Laboratories and the commercial sector, it is DHS's goal to investigate any and all potential detection technologies that may assist in the identification of explosive and flammable liquids.  In order to exhaust the list of technologies that are already being investigated and to enhance the opportunities for non-traditional vendors, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS is seeking potential sources of Bottle Screening Devices capable of detecting and distinguishing explosive and flammable liquids from benign liquids (drinks, lotions, hygiene products, contact lens solutions, etc.).  The anticipated application of these devices is screening bottles or other containers at passenger checkpoints, which will require the devices to have a 200 bottle per hour minimum throughput and must meet a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 or greater.  This means that the basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include high-fidelity laboratory integration of components and software.  The device will be expected to function on full or partially full bottles of any shape and color made from glass, plastic, paper or other materials which are typically found in the marketplace and passenger stream of commerce.  DHS is seeking sources offering devices that can be tested within 30 days from the date of any award.  The DHS(S&T) and Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) will use the information gathered from this market survey to develop our source list.  The Government encourages teaming arrangements that will provide the best solution.  To further refine our source list for efficiency purposes, this market survey also requests that interested vendors provide capability statements.  Interested vendors can electronically submit no more than a five page capability statement package (MS Word document).  The page limitation does not include the cover letter.  Congress enacted the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY Act) as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.  The SAFETY Act provides limitations on the potential liability of those firms that develop and provide qualified anti-terrorism technologies.  DHS's Science and Technology Directorate, acting through its Office of SAFETY Act Implementation, encourages the development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies by making available the SAFETY Act's system of risk management, and liability management.  The Science and Technology Directorate invites SAFETY Act applications for technologies that may enhance our current capacity to detect the presence of liquid-based explosive material or components.  Such SAFETY Act applications will receive special attention and be given expedited treatment.  Technologies which are found to be effective in detecting the presence of liquid-based explosives (and thereby meet DHS specifications and requirements) and can be deployed to protect the traveling public will receive SAFETY Act protections.

This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immedia tely to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in que stion, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment / repair - overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair programs that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond wit h information regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services.  Companies capable of performing this effort may r espond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AC (LISA M. RUSSO), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a 3-Dimension Computed Tomography upgrade to the Phoenix nanome|x system.  The nanome|x system is currently used extensively to provide screening of engine cur-off (ECO) sensors, deemed critically 1R, that are to be installed in the remaining external tanks for all subsequent space shuttle flights.  In addition, this agency unique instrument is used for non-destructive failure analysis of all electrical, electro-mechanical and electronic (EEE) parts for flight and ground support equipment, payloads, and instrumentation.  The proposed procurement will enhance the current capabilities and will allow never before seen 3-dimensional views of ECO's at the highest resolution currently possible.	This will permit a more detailed investigation into their possible failure modes and permit engineers to create and validate new designs.  In addition, this upgrade will allow non-destructive failure analysis of componenets internal to EEE parts and assemblies permitting faster diagnostics that circumvent schedule and cost impacts in support of newer initiatives like Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from phoenix|x-ray Systems & Services, Inc. pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed procurement is considered to an upgrade to pre-existing equipment.  Software and hardware componenets in both the nanomex and the upgrade contain proprietary hardware and software interfaces.  As the author and developer of the software and hardware, phoenix|x-ray Systems & Services, Inc. is deemed to the only source that can provide the highly specialized software and hardware installations required by the proposed procurement.  While the government has unlimited rights to the executable codes of the software, the base architecture and specific numerical algorithms are proprietary to phoenix|x-ray Systems & Services, Inc.	In light of this fact, it is impractical for the government to obtain this capability by purchasing other hardware and software becasue it will not work with the currently installed instrument.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 1, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>WORK ORDER SCOPE
3D Laser Scanning Pilot Project
 
 
1.0	IDENTIFICATION 

1.1	Work Order Name.  Conduct Exterior 3D Laser Scanning Survey for Three Federal Facilities in Brooklyn, Atlanta, and Miami.


2.0	OBJECTIVES

2.1	The objective of this work is to generate high-quality documentation using three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning and/or other surveying technologies on three government facilities in Miami, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and Brooklyn, New York.  These are national pilot projects for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) that will use 3D laser scanning technologies for archiving historic building elements, documenting current conditions for existing buildings for planned modernizations, and documenting as-built conditions for new construction.  The design objective for this task is to ascertain the viability of usable output data to create 2D-CAD elevation drawings and/or 3D building information models (BIM), as applicable.  The program objective is to extend the GSA BIM Guide with a chapter and appendix containing laser scanning generic scopes of work and best practices.

2.2	The following three facilities were selected by GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) for these pilot projects: U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Brooklyn, New York; Peachtree Summit Federal Building in Atlanta, Georgia; and the Miami Judicial Campus in Miami, Florida.  Each facility has unique objectives listed below.

2.2.1.	U.S. Post Office and Courthouse.  Planning is underway for a replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 section of the structure with new terra cotta or alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.  The building is on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a New York City Landmark.  3D laser scanning will provide a current-condition record of the existing masonry architecture and assist in future renovation designs and terra cotta fabrication.  The objective of the scanning at this location is to provide 2D-CAD elevations required to document as-built conditions.  These elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs.

2.2.2.	Peachtree Summit Federal Building.  The programming of a rolling renovation of the facility is underway.  The building does not have 2D CAD drawings as it was constructed before CAD was developed.  The primary objective of 3D Laser Scanning is to provide accurate 2D elevations for the exterior of the facility.  There are also significant deficiencies in the original construction that require documentation in order to provide future architecture and engineering firms a representative as-built condition of the facility.  The existing aluminum window frames and glazing are out of specification and often require replacement.  Concrete columns, beams, and balconies in the open corner sections were constructed out of specification and are starting to spall.  3D laser scanning will allow a more accurate analysis of original construction deficiencies and provide designers with as-built drawings to develop force protection measures and new window assemblies.

2.2.3.	Miami Federal Campus.  The primary purpose of 3D scanning for this area is to provide an integrated facility plan to map and link the five buildings in the Miami Justice Complex and overhead bridges into a cohesive BIM site model.  The initial area that requires scanning is the street-level corridor between the federal buildings on NE 4th Street between NE 1st Avenue and NW 1st Avenue.  In addition, the Dyer Federal building on the SE corner of the campus is preparing for a major renovation and restoration and requires historical documentation before the design and construction phases.  


3.0	BACKGROUND

3.1	Since 2003, GSA Public Buildings Service Office of the Chief Architect has established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program (http://www.gsa.gov/bim). One primary application area of this program includes the use of 3D laser scanning technology to augment and streamline the management of as-built spatial information.  GSA plans to use the data collected from the pilot projects in this Scope of Work to draft a common guide for all future GSA scanning projects.  GSA chose three facilities that represent examples from its historic, mid-century, and urban project types.  Each facility’s dimensions and pictures are included in Appendix A through C.

3.1.1.	The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is a historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.  The building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal state and municipal buildings are organized.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The exterior facades of the 1892 building are built of granite-faced masonry, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.  An upcoming GSA project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.

3.1.2.	The Peachtree Summit Federal Building was constructed over thirty-two years ago and does not have accurate CAD drawings.  Many exterior windows have suffered damage from stresses related to existing concrete beam deformations, poor assembly installation, and live loads from wind.  Leakage from rain also exists between the exterior concrete beams and window assemblies as a result of poor design and construction.  The entire facility will receive a complete renovation and upgrade in future years and will be required to meet updated force protection standards.

3.1.3.	The Miami Federal Campus consists of five court, detention, and administrative buildings that are in various life-cycle stages.  The Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Courthouse is near completion and includes a tunnel to the adjacent Tower Building.  Four other existing buildings are located in the campus with the new courthouse and are connected via tunnels and overhead walkways.  The Tower Building connects by bridges to both the Dyer Building and the Federal Detention Center, as well as by tunnel to the new courthouse.  The Bureau of Prisons Federal Detention Center connects by bridge to both the Tower Building and the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building.  The David W. Dyer Federal Building and Courthouse connects by bridge to the Tower Building.



4.0	REQUIREMENTS

The government anticipates multiple awards as a result of this solicitation.  The contractor shall develop and submit a proposal for one, two, or all three locations (each project has a different set of base and optional requirements, see Sections 6 and 7).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g. agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, fax number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to increase the Contract Ceiling.  The new wording is:  "Contract ceiling will be set to allow for 50% growth (120 MYEs) should funding be provided to augment engineering efforts in targeted areas."

The MDA intends to award, based on FAR Part 6.302-2, two sole source cost-plus-fixed fee contracts to incumbents Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Sparta, Inc. to provide for continued Scientific, Engineering, Technical Assistance (SETA) support to the Director, Systems Engineering and Integration, in the Washington, DC area during the transition to an MDA reengineered organization and the transfer of major systems engineering functions to Huntsville, AL.   Within two years, as transfer plans are finalized and facilities are made available, MDA intends to competitively award a contract for SETA support to MDA Systems Engineering in the Huntsville, AL and begin the phased move of work and government personnel from Washington, DC to Huntsville, AL.   MDA intends to complete the transfer of work within the five year period.  

These SETA bridge contracts will be for a base period of 1 year with four 1-year options.  As options are exercised, the SOW will be tailored to reduce the scope of work as responsibility is transferred to Huntsville, AL.  An initial level-of-effort (LOE) is approximately 80 Man-Year Equivalents (MYEs) and will be reduced by phases to approximately 20 MYEs to support system engineering work remaining in the Washington, DC area.   At the completion of the transition, MDA intends to competitively award a follow-on contract for SETA support in the Washington, DC area which will include the Systems Engineering functions relocated to MDA HQ, Ft Belvoir, VA.  

CSC and SPARTA are embedded members of a unique engineering entity referred to as the Missile Defense System Engineering Team (MDSET) National Team.  The MDSET consists of individuals from Industry (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics), Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) (Aerospace, MITRE, MIT/LL, Sandia NL), University Affiliated Research Centers (John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory), military and government civilian members.  The MDSET has evolved into a high performance team that efficiently draws upon the distinct expertise provided by each community of members.  Individuals of the two SETA contracts, CSC and SPARTA, are distributed throughout the MDSET and are integral parts of integrated government, contractor, and FFRDC teams.  These individuals provide highly specialized services, are not separable from other parts of the MDSET by function, role or skill level, and cannot be replaced without severe disruption to ongoing work and the smooth functioning of the MDSET.  The proposed acquisition strategy allows for a phased replacement of MDSET SETA members by supported functional area at a logical break point in the system engineering product cycle that will coincide with a preplanned transfer of the government team members to Huntsville, AL. All MDSET companies and individuals are required to sign non-disclosure agreements.  Companies must also sign Organizational Conflict of Interest/Disclosure forms to ensure they are able to render impartial assistance to the agency without an unfair competitive advantage or impaired objectivity.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 has been posted in the Business Opportunities section on the following NAVAIR Orlando TSD website: 

http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD

COMMAND AIRCRAFT CREW TRAINING (CACT) PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE C-40 AIRCRAFT

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy's Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for Navy C-40A (Boeing 737-700C with increased gross weight (IGW) as configured for U.S. Navy) aircrew.  

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level "C" or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "C" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.

<CONTACT>Su Jin Chang, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 882-6191, Fax (703) 882-6356, Email Su.Chang@mda.mil - Su Jin Chang, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 882-6191, Fax (703) 882-6356, Email Su.Chang@mda.mil
<DESC>This is an addendum to the Manufacturing and Producibility Broad Agency Announcement (Reference-Number-HQ0006-06-MP-BAA). The purpose of this addendum is to add Next Generation Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) Standardization as a BAA topic.

The MDA IMU Standard and NGIMU address these goals by 1) reducing the acquisition costs of IMUs for the BMDS, 2) improving reliability of the BMDS by providing multiple vendors that enable the BMDS to circumvent sole source suppliers, and 3) improving producibility of a High Altitude Exo-atmospheric Nuclear Survivability (HAENS) standard radiation hardened IMU.  MDA/DEP (as well as other organizations within the MDA) achieves these objectives in part by utilizing capabilities based acquisition and Engineering Manufacturing Readiness Levels (EMRLs).

MDA is soliciting BAA proposals that will prove interchangeability and manufacturability of next generation IMUs by developing and demonstrating low cost, radiation tolerant IMUs that addresses the performance requirements of a next generation kill/carrier vehicle to include navigation and/or target tracking.  These IMUs will be utilized to validate the manufacturing of the deliverable IMUs and to support a planned flight test of one or more IMUs on a BMDS flight test vehicle.  

BAA white papers must describe at a minimum, how they would reach Concept Design Review (CODR).  At the CODR, contractors will present the maturity of their proposed IMU, and their proposed plan for the subsequent program phases. White papers should also include a cost goal for a next generation IMU.  The cost goals should be expressed in terms of an expected cost plus or minus 15%. 

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA/MP program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal. Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below. White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information. In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government’s rights in technical data, which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper. The MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighed equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA/DEP program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the ability to develop and demonstrate near-term applications; (3) the offer’s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016).  In order have the NGIMU ready for a scheduled test flight, this BAA addendum will only remain open until September 4, 2006; however, offerors may submit BAA white papers related to IMU technology topic area against the general MP BAA until February 1, 2007. The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers to this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards; however, if MDA does decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award. The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Su Chang, Contract Specialist, at Su.Chang@mda.mil.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for an outreach system to display ASTER and MODIS data, both internally and at outreach events.  The minimum requirements for this system are: 1) Consist of both a 16" and a 24" projection sphere with projection capabilities; 2) Have touch screen display for operation; 3) Include on-site training and product setup; 4) Include custom shipping containers; 5) "Storyteller" software package which enables the LP DAAC to display its own Remote Sensing data sets on the system; 6) Remote control capability; and 7) One-year hardware and software support and maintenance.  The only system found to meet these USGS requirements is the Magic Planet System, which is manufactured by Global Imagination.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies as a sole source from Global Imagination, 750 University Avenue, Los Gatos, California, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

CWG is the only contractor known to possess the following qualifications needed to meet the Bureau's requirements: (1) Specific interest and ability to cost-share this project. This project was approved for funding to CWG by BLM's Washington Office based on CWG's proposal and on past performance with similar projects in other BLM Districts; (2) A close relationship with both the Oregon State University Herbarium staff and the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, which allows CWG to draw on staff and information to assist them in this challenge cost share project; and (3) Intimate knowledge of the Prineville District, its lands and flora from a previous, similar project related to the genus Carex. Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the three criteria described above to the Contracting Officer.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses due no later than September 5, 2006, by 11:59p.m. DST.

<DESC>DSCA/HQ in Arlington, VA and the DSADC in Mechanicsburg, PA are interested in moving to a SAN solution for network data storage and on-site daily backups, as well as maintaining weekly full backups off site to each other’s SAN.  The SAN solution is expected to allow for an increase in data storage, increase reliability and flexibility, and allow for a decrease in the footprint of the existing network server space.  The SAN combined with mutual backup processes is also expected to improve the Disaster Recovery (DR) posture of both facilities.  The weekly backup files from each facility must be maintained for up to one full year on the SANs.  These backup files will then be archived from the SAN onto storage media that can be kept without the need of a host system.

Background
Each of the DSCA facilities has servers running Microsoft Server 2003, utilizing internal hard drives in RAID configurations.  These servers do not share hard drive space and are completely independent.  Currently both DSCA facilities perform monthly and weekly backups, as well as daily incremental backups.  The monthly backups are stored off site.  The daily and most recent weekly backups are held on site, and the older weekly backups are sent off site.

Both DSCA facilities are also nearing a total of 1.2 TB of storage, leading to the data management and existing tape backup procedures to be at or near operational limits.  These two situations lead to a necessity of detailed and practiced Disaster Recovery (DR) solutions.

Program Objects and Scope of Work

DSCA is interested in turnkey systems installed at both facilities allowing for existing data storage requirements of 2.5 TB and allowing for a 15% growth each year over the next 5 years without any configuration changes or purchase of additional equipment.  These systems must also allow for automated and policy based weekly full data backups and daily incremental backups to the sister facility without any impact to the daily operations of these facilities.  These backup processes must also not adversely impact the performance of the existing Internet and NIPRNet bandwidth of these facilities.  It is expected that the network backup process be time scaled to make intelligent use of existing bandwidth. The recovery process must allow for a recovery point to any point in time.

Each of the DSCA facilities must also be capable of opening, running, and executing the data from the other facility.  This is to include the capability of allowing both facilities to operate from either site in the event of a disaster.  This DR capability must be able to be employed with minimal configuration changes.  The DR capability must be able to be tested and returned to the normal state during non-duty hours, such as nights and weekends.

After the installation is complete and all system functions are working as intended, DSCA requires 3 years of hardware and software support to include 24/7 telephone support and on site support request lead time to be no greater than the next business day.  DSCA requires this support to include all major and minor upgrades and all associated support services to include troubleshooting and any other related issues associated with the networks.  

Specific Tasks:
1.	 Install and configure the SAN, to include required data storage devices, controllers, network switches, and related hardware at both facilities allowing the existing servers to boot from and share file space on the SAN
2. Install and configure all required equipment for the automated time scale backup systems with a rapid restore and replication capability
3. Install and configure all software and firmware required by the SAN configuration
4. Test and verify SAN configuration for optimal performance at both facilities
5. Test and verify backup and restore capabilities at both facilities
6. Test and verify the DR capability at each facility.

Deliverables:  
SAN and backup solution hardware and software for both DSCA facilities
Hardware and software documentation on paper or CD
New network configuration diagram in a VISIO format on CD
All associated licenses for installed equipment and software

 Security/Sensitivity  
All work associated with this SOW is UNCLASSIFIED.

The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is seeking contractors capable of  providing comprehensive statistical support, data management and analysis activities for DMID-sponsored clinical work.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. The evaluation of new and improved vaccine and therapeutic candidates in clinical trials and clinical studies is an essential element of DMID efforts.  Through an extensive network of grant and contract research programs, DMID supports a broad range of clinical research, including single-site and multi-center Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials of bacterial, viral and parasitic vaccines, therapeutics, and other biologics and drugs as preventive and therapeutic measures against infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories. Support is also provided for a variety of other studies, including:  targeted surveillance for pathogens of interest in study populations; evaluations of novel investigational product delivery systems; and reevaluation of current vaccine formulations, schedules and modes of delivery.  Clinical trials and clinical studies are also supported to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm), and to meet critical public health needs and opportunities for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers’ printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Department’s specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant. In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturer’s product at this stage in the program’s life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Department’s requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA)
COMPUTING SERVICES LOGISTICS 

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME:  Cisco Equipment


Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity

The requiring activity for this action is Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, ATTN: IMD CMR 402, APO AE 09180. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action

Requirement is for the purchase of Cisco wireless devices for the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) network fabric.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services

CISCO network equipment such as wireless LANs, antennas, line cords, WLAN controllers, and Crypto client licenses.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor’s Unique Qualifications.

This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing LRMC Wireless upgrade program and will be an extension of previously purchased and installed equipment.  CISCO products are required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  In addition, LRMC network architecture is supported by the Tri-Service Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO). Cisco equipment is supported within the TIMPO sparing and maintenance inventory program for providing replacements and support world wide to MHS facilities. Current LRMC inventory investment of Cisco equipment is over 1.2 million dollars and totals over 250 devices. The LRMC site is 100% Cisco switches, routers and network equipment to provide component inter-operability. LRMC is currently running a Cisco proprietary VLAN protocol on the Cisco equipment, Non Cisco equipment will not inter-operate correctly with LRMC's current implementation of the VLAN protocol. Additionally, Cisco equipment meets DoD  FIPS 140-2 certification requirements.

All tools for management and managing equipment are specifically designed to support Cisco devices. Site personnel and system administrators are trained exclusively on Cisco equipment. Re-training of site personnel is cost prohibitive and is not justifiable. Continued purchase of Cisco equipment will save the European region over $30,000 dollars in re-training cost on new equipment. If LRMC receives non Cisco equipment, devices will not function or inter-op properly with current Cisco equipment and have the potential to sit idle as they will not furnish the site with the equipment required to provide continued health care to service men and women.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

A combined synopsis/solicitation will be released to FEDBIZOPPS.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

Price reasonableness will be determined based upon competition.

8.  Description of Market Research 

Market research indicates there are multiple resellers of CISCO equipment.  Research found the following companies:


InterNetwork Experts, 1955 Lakeway Dr. Ste 220, Lewisville, TX 75057, 469-549-3937, Contract Vehicle BPA W91RUS-05-A-0006

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431

The research that produced the overarching solution for the LRMC upgrade program included an evaluation of multiple technologies and equipment manufacturers.  These included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation considered the personal experiences of site personnel, a review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, a review of currently fielded equipment, and a review of GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO switch product line as the facility core layer, distribution layer and access layer switches.

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the LRMC area.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

Any reseller or wholesaler of these products will be eligible to compete such as:

InterNetwork Experts, 1955 Lakeway Dr. Ste 220, Lewisville, TX 75057, 469-549-3937, Contract Vehicle BPA W91RUS-05-A-0006

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

None.  Market research determined there are resellers of these products.

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor’s receipt of order.

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

14.  Section 508 Compliance

Required Section 508 documentation has been provided.

BRAND NAME DOCUMENTATION: Netflow Tracker from Crannog Software
(For Under $100K)

1.  Identify the activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 

The Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), Information Management Division, located in Landstuhl Germany.

2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 

Netflow Tracker from Crannog-software company. The manufacture part numbers are NFTM 10000, Netflow Tracker – 5 Devices Annual and NFT 1000, Netflow Tracker – 5 Devices Annual. 

3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the limited sources acquisition.  Justify the use of limited sources due to Brand Name.

This software provides real time monitoring of Netflow data, harnessing flow information from Cisco IOS NetFlow and IPFIX, J-FLow, cflowd and sFlow, providing the LRMC network managers detailed network traffic information without the use of probes or additional appliances. 

Crannog software is the sole provider of Crannog Netflow Tracker and is based on the windows OS platform. Most other vendors utilize Unix or a Linux derivative and LRMC does not currently or plan to have Unix/Linux system administrators. It is not cost effective to hire and retain a Unix system administrator for one application, as all other LRMC applications that we support are based on the Windows based OS and current personnel are presently fully trained to utilize this OS. 

4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for sole source procurement?

The requirement to capture full NetFlow / IPFIX traffic information, allowing significant in-depth application and protocol information analysis to take place including user, server and applications activity was identified in conjunction with the ongoing wireless and VoIP initiative. Traffic views by user, user group, conversation, system and application that is suitable for security, QoS, traffic analysis requirements is essential for the successful deployment of these two systems. 

If this application is not purchased in a timely manner, both the wireless and VoIP initiative will face a difficult, if not impossible task of succeeding. This software tool is essential to the correct configuration and initialization of the devices that the wireless and VoIP systems will run on.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Quotation numbered N65886-06-T-0004. This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11, Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13 and DFARS Change Notice 1006711. 

NAVAIR Depot Jacksonville, Florida has a requirement for E-6 Standardized General Markup Language (SGML) and Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) viewing capabilities. This requirement is being synopsized as a competitive, 100% small business set-aside acquisition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330 and a small business size standard of $23M. The contract type will be a commercial simplified acquisition purchase (SAP) with firm-fixed price Contract Line Items (CLINS) for CLIN 0001 Labor and cost reimbursable CLINs for 0002 ODC’s and 0003 Travel.

The specific requirements are as follows: TASK 1 Modify SMP system to utilize System Optimization for Web Server Enhancement. This IETM performance enhancement requires the restructure of the current IETM navigational files into hierarchical segments. Modifications would be required to reconfigure the IETM search system in order to accommodate the restructured navigational files. Task 2 SMP system to utilize AutoCAD files in IETM (viewer as part of build). This IETM system enhancement requires a programming effort to establish AutoCAD file format recognition within the IETM system and the IETM Installation Program will be expanded to include the provisions for installing the required AutoCAD plug that is required to render the files for view. Task 3 Modify SMP system to have ability to put calculation sheets in IETM. This IETM enhancement requires an initial one-time programming effort to accommodate the Calculation Sheet functionality within the IETM interface and the IETM build application and to develop the ground rules for individual calculation sheet development. This feature will support a dynamic calculation sheet environment where the calculation sheet content may be populated with automatically maintained referencing as is currently provided throughout the standard IETM content. A sample generic calculation sheet will be provided for testing. Task 4 Modify system to utilize the placement of video clips in the IETM. This IETM enhancement requires a programming effort to revise the current IETM infrastructure so that it may support the recognition of specific types of customer-provided video segments. A directory structure will be created within the IETM file system to host the video files.

The Detector shall be cooled by a triple stage peltier cooling device to -45oC to reduce dark current and background noise resulting in enhanced detection limits.  3. Detector Operating Modes. The detector must be capable of operating in the following modes :- Analysis –   User selected analytical wavelengths are simultaneously integrated in a manner whereby the signal to noise ratio is optimized while the photo-generated charge level is maintained in the linear range of the device.  This should be accomplished by allowing for the observation of the signal level on any pixel at any point in the exposure.  If a pixel is determined to be nearing saturation, it shall be read out, cleared, the counts stored and the integration allowed to continue if the user selected time has not expired.   If the detector pixel being interrogated is not nearing saturation, then it shall not be cleared, but allowed to continue accumulating counts until the next cycle, at which time the process shall be repeated.	The clearing of any pixel shall not affect any other pixel.	 In this way, both very low and very bright lines can be measured during an analysis run.  For every selected wavelength interval, peak and background measurements should be taken simultaneously. The detector must be capable of simultaneously measuring a set of elements together with multiple internal standard lines so that each analyte element can be paired with a suitable internal standard line.  A minimum of 7 lines shall be selectable for use as internal standard lines. Full Frame Imaging - Allows for the spectrographic imaging of the entire spectrum in a matter of seconds for qualitative analysis and methods development.  Additionally, the image shall be capable of being interrogated for the presence of any element and providing semi-quantitative data on the concentration of any element capable of being determined by ICP spectroscopy, whether or not that element was initially desired.   The system must have the Intelliframe option which allows all lines to be presented in a single image without saturation. VII. Data System 1. The spectrometer shall be controlled from an industry-standard Pentium computer complete with CD-ROM/ (reader/writer) and 23” LCD monitor. The software supports all printers via the Windows 2000 or XP operating system. VIII. Software	    The instrument system software shall be based on the Windows 2000 Professional or XP operating system. The software shall provide full control of all instrument functions including plasma ignition, gas flows, viewing position, and monitoring of safety interlocks. It must include as a minimum the following features and capabilities: - -Full instrument control with the ability to display parameters and instrument response in real time -Fully automated system start up and shutdown via the instrument control window  -Real time graphics for instrument setup and monitoring -All set up parameters including plasma position to be stored on disk.	 -Internal diagnostics including error checking and complete fault log.	 -Comprehensive wavelength library with indication of preferred line for each element. ----Automatic identification of possible spectral interferences when selecting wavelengths for analysis.

The software also includes the option of a “speed” or “precision” mode to optimize spectrometer functions. -Automatic interference corrections should be available in all measurement modes including truly simultaneous background correction and internal standardization as well as interelement correction. -Full data reprocessing capabilities including editing samples, blanks, standards, calibration curves, elements, interference corrections and reporting parameters without the need to rerun samples -Linking of data to the method, a copy of the method used to measure any data shall be automatically saved along with the sample results. Any edits to the data shall cause an updated copy of the method to be saved. -Results output formatted in mixed concentration units e.g. ppb, ppm etc. and the ability to use element specific correction factors e.g. element to oxide, for ease of data interpretation by the user should be possible.	    -Fully integrated and user definable quality control software shall be included in the basic software suite provided with the spectrometer for automated QA/QC during unattended operation. -True multitasking operation – can set up a new method whilst an automatic run is taking place. -Can open files from previous analyses whilst an automatic run is taking place without fear of overwriting existing data with current results -The software shall provide completely integrated and optimized use of accessories with the ICP. Communication shall be bi-directional such that if either the ICP or accessory fails the other device will stop the procedure and the instrument will return to a failsafe state. IX.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-06-10503, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of $500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable. This procurement is for the preparation and delivery of cryopreserved human hapatocytes, pooled human liver microsomes, and frozen human liver sections and liver microsomes. The anticipated period of performance will be 36 months. A.  Background. Environmental chemicals are metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver.  The elderly may be at increased risk from environmental chemicals because they have altered liver metabolism of these chemicals.  In order to assess the potential sensitivity of the elderly to environmental chemicals, we will examine the metabolism of a series of environmental chemicals in human liver samples obtained from young adult and elderly humans of both genders. This contract will consist of three tasks.  The first Task is to obtain ten (10) cryopreserved human hepatocyte preparations.  The second Task is to obtain eight (8) separate samples of  pooled human liver microsomes. The third Task is to obtain a total of 32  human liver samples.  These samples are divided into four groups of 8 that include young male adults (ages 21-45), elderly male adults (over 70 years old), young female adults (age 21-45) and elderly female adults (over 70 years old). Metabolism studies often use either cryopreserved human hepatocytes or pooled human liver microsomes.  EPA will study the metabolism of prototype environmental chemicals in cryopreserved human hepatocytes and pooled human microsomes.  These samples need to be obtained from the same supplier in order to ensure that all samples are handled equally and go through the same quality assurance procedures.  This will ensure that the comparisons made between the pooled human microsones, the cryopreserved human hepatoctyes and the 32  individual human liver microsomes will be based on the true difference between these samples and not due to differences in sample collection, preparation and storage.  The purpose of this contract is acquire gender and age specific samples from the normal supply chain of the contractor.  The contractor shall not specifically recruit sample collection in order to fulfill this contractual requirement. B. Contractor Requirements. The contractor shall provide these three Task in this contract. 1. Preparation and delivery of cryopreserved human hepatocytes. 2. Preparation and delivery of pooled human liver microsomes. 3.

<DESC>This is a Combine Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This Combine Synopsis/Solicitation replaces a previous announcement REQ101487 posted on May 22, 2006 in its entirety. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through August 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-12.     This acquisition is 100% a small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.

Objective: To perform risk and benefit evaluation of commercial seafood that focuses on the risk of methylmercury. The evaluation will assess the extent to which nutritional and other health benefits from eating fish may be relevant to risk from methylmercury.  The evaluation will provide risk management options for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration in light of the latest scientific, technical, and economic data and information.  These options will be made for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration about actions to be taken, if any, on the basis of this analysis and discussions and input from stakeholders, giving due consideration to FDA’s broad responsibilities under the FD&C and PHS Acts. 

Background: 
Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that can have pronounced adverse effects in humans at very high doses.  These effects have been seen in extreme poisoning events as a result of industrial spills in Japan and Iraq.  In the United States, the primary exposure to methylmercury is generally regarded to be through the consumption of fish. Almost all fish have at least trace amounts of methylmercury. Historically, the public health questions surrounding methylmercury have involved determining exposure through fish consumption over time that would be necessary to cause an adverse effect.  The degree of exposure is dependent on both the type and amount of fish consumed.  Public health actions, both in the United States and elsewhere, have focused on the development of daily or weekly levels of exposure that are deemed to be safe, “action levels,” for the amount of methylmercury that would be allowed in fish in order to keep exposures from exceeding the level deemed to be safe, and consumer advisories recommending upper limits on fish consumption both in terms of amounts and types.  Fish have always been considered a good source of nutrition, but more recently, questions have been raised about potential health consequences of not consuming, or substantially limiting the consumption of, seafood.  Many of these questions derive from data about the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish and other potentially positive nutritional characteristics of fish.     

Scope of Work: In cooperation with the Office of Seafood, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and with the assistance of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, CFSAN’s Chief Medical Officer, FDA staff, EPA, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders, as needed, the contractor shall: 1.Conduct a new risk evaluation for commercial fish that takes into account all data and all previous assessments.   The risk evaluation shall focus on the sufficiency of data available to FDA to carry out its mission of determining whether a reasonable possibility of injury exists for all or some portion(s) of U.S. consumers. 2. Conduct a benefits evaluation of seafood in the diet that includes but is not necessarily limited to:  literature search, and analysis to the extent practicable of known and potential nutritional and other health benefits from seafood consumption and estimates of lost benefits and/or public health harm from dietary changes in seafood consumption, if any. 3. Obtain peer review per FDA and OMB requirements. 4. Provide risk management options to FDA on the basis of the above evaluation(s).  5. Conduct at least two public meetings, announced in the Federal Register, to share new data and information and to obtain oral and/or written input. 6. Meet with agency, HHS, and other federal agency representatives to discuss the status of the project. 7. Prepare briefing materials and provide support to the agency as needed.    
8.Provide advice associated with consumer studies by participation in the Technical Advisory Group. 

Deliverables: The contractor shall submit the following reports/deliverables in the timeframes indicated: 1. A document that has been peer reviewed and that contains: A risk evaluation update. A benefits evaluation update. Options where appropriate. Due:  End of calendar year 2006. This document may be a single document or more than one document at the discretion of the contractor.  Conduct at least two public meetings. Due: End of calendar year 2006. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will provide adequate scientific and technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, peer review, etc.;  adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract. Support to be Provided by FDA:   Adequate scientific technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, etc.; adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Primary consideration for all quotation received shall first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed Cost or Price.  However, in the event that the technical evaluation reveals that two or more offerors are approximately equal in the technical ability, then cost may become a significant factor in determining award.  In any event, the government reserves the right to make an award based on a best value determination, cost and other factors considered. 

Technical Evaluation. a. Proposed Type of Personnel: 50%: 

Offeror shall demonstrate that it has the personnel requisite to: Understand seafood hazards and spectrum of controls that are available for those hazards in order to evaluate the hazard of methyl mercury and potential controls for that hazard in the context of overall risk management strategy for seafood. Understand and evaluate the existing national and international risk management framework for methyl mercury, including: The “safety assessment” model, including its strengths and weaknesses as these apply to assessing risk for environmental contaminants and for methyl mercury in particular; The “risk assessment” model, including its strengths and weaknesses as these would apply to assessing risk for environmental contaminants and for methyl mercury in particular; Understand and evaluate existing and emerging epidemiological data on methyl mercury as they may adversely affect various health endpoints. Understand and evaluate existing and emerging scientific data on potential health and nutritional benefits from the consumption of fish. Understand and provide guidance to a team of experts on options to model methyl mercury risks against health benefits from fish consumption in order to conduct a risk/benefit evaluation of this food/hazard combination. 

b. Organizational Experience: 30%: 

Offeror shall demonstrate past experience in: Managing teams of experts in the conduct of highly innovative and technical projects to a successful conclusion. Risk management in food safety and seafood safety in particular. Evaluating and understanding methyl mercury as a potential food safety hazard in fish.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to provide for the Application of Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) Screening Devices to Provide Hearing Measures in Cetaceans for NOAA’s Ocean Acoustics Program, part of the NOAA, NMFS’ Office of Science and Technology, Marine Ecosystems Division.

How marine animals hear and are affected by human noise sources are critical and largely unanswered questions relevant to NOAA’s ability to manage protected species under federal statutes (MMPA and ESA).  Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) have been used to measure hearing in odontocete cetaceans in laboratory conditions, which has yielded similar results to behavioral measurements.  However, the number of cetacean species represented in captive settings is a small minority of the total number of cetaceans, raising the need to develop means of evaluating hearing in marine mammals not present in laboratories.  

Recently, AEP technologies have been applied to a limited extent on stranded marine mammals, expanding the number of species for which audiometric data exist. Conducting a hearing test using AEP is relatively rapid and technological developments have advanced the field rapidly.  However, until recently the equipment and techniques used have not been particularly portable or technically manageable for most members of the marine mammal stranding network to use.  Thus, there is a need for the application of a simple, portable device to screen for hearing loss in cetaceans that can be used in the field by authorized and trained, but not necessarily specialized, marine mammal stranding respondents.  Threshold hearing data could be provided to stranding respondents and attending veterinarians as a baseline for animals undergoing rehabilitation to determine whether any antibiotics have produced ototoxic effects.  Animals identified as having generally compromised hearing capability using the screening device could then be assessed using more sophisticated and specialized systems to more exactly identify functional deficits.

Prototype devices currently exist that are generally similar to hearing screening devices used to test human infants.  While there have been numerous applications of specialized systems on cetaceans and other marine mammals, the existing easy-to-use-and-interpret prototypes have not been applied on cetaceans and “ground-truthed” relative to systems of known capability.  This procurement will support the application of existing prototypes to obtain auditory evoked potential thresholds and give a Pass/Fail result relative to a priori criteria.  Several signal types will be used to compare the relationship between data obtained with simple versus sophisticated systems based on stimulus parameters.  

The contractor shall support the application of a simple, portable marine mammal AEP screening device on captive cetaceans and compare the results with those obtained using more sophisticated systems.  

Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

1)  Train 1-2 captive dolphin(s) (or other cetacean species) to remain motionless while suction cup sensors are attached on the dorsal surface behind, a suction cup transducer is attached to its lower jaw, and a series of sounds and resulting neural signals are presented and recorded.
2)  Obtain AEP measurements using the prototype screening device with amplitude modulated (AM) tones across a relative broad frequency band (at least 10-100 kHz).  Data will be collected across multiple sessions on the same individual in order to assess variability that may be introduced by, for instance, small differences in the positioning of projecting and/or receiving transducers.
3)  Obtain AEP measurements using the prototype screening device with broadband click stimuli.  Data will be collected within individuals across multiple experimental sessions.  
4)  Obtain AEP data using established, comprehensive AEP measurement system with AM tones (also at least 10-100 kHz testing bandwidth) over multiple experimental sessions.  
5)  Obtain AEP data using established, comprehensive AEP measurement system using broadband click stimuli across multiple experimental sessions.  
6)  Conduct statistical analyses of results obtained using each stimulus and measurement system and quantify the accuracy/reliability of the simple screening device relative to the a priori criteria.
8)  Submit findings for publication in the open, peer-reviewed literature.  

The period of performance is for 12 months from Date of Award.   Payment shall be made upon receipt of invoice with final technical report at completion of the project. 

The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm-fixed-price basis.  The award shall be made on a best-value basis using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial acquisition procedures.  Quotes will be evaluated based upon their approach, past performance and price.  While these factors are relatively equal, they are listed in order of importance.    

The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-12. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-l, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government shall award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror conforming to the solicitation which will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  FAR 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. All interested contractors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at the CCR website (www.ccr.gov).

These services will be acquired using simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

All responsible sources may respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation with a quotation addressed to Robin Prather, NOAA Acquisition Division, 1305 East West Highway, Room 7146, Silver Spring MD 20910, to be received no later than 1:00 p.m., September 1, 2006.  Responses may be faxed to 301-713-0806 or emailed to Robin.Prather@noaa.gov.  Responses must be no more than 10 pages.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award as a result of this RFQ.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to confirm NOAA's receipt of quote.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on NOI-RML-6047. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 dated 08/04/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE: The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 95(ninety five) custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix. The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000. The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis. The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT. Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix. Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Hewlett Packard Desktop/Tower workstations and servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure network computing requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/MNT has identified the Hewlett-Packard Desktop/Tower workstations and servers as key components of the Department’s network computing systems. Equipment listed above is required to provide network computing capabilities to existing Department of State’s enterprise network computing infrastructure based on existing networking computing equipment meeting the Department of State’s network security and compatibility requirements.  Time does not allow for changes in other salient systems due to configurations. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s network computing requirements. Numerous Hewlett-Packard equipment has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for Global IT Modernization (GITM) Program deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board (ITCCB).  The Hewlett-Packard equipments being ordered are identical to equipments being referenced in BPA above or the latest versions of the similar models. *NO COMPATIBLES.

-The recorders on the shelves in the briefing rooms will be remaining in the room
-The TV’s will not need computer hookups
-VCR outputs: BNC; Audio Outputs: RCA
-No VTC required/no upscaling necessary
-TV’s will be wall mounted (just like the two finished briefing rooms)

Brand Name or Equal :

1.  The 412 MXS/MXMAPI request the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of a Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries 53 foot drop frame trailer to support crash recovery operations at Edwards Air Force Base.

2.  The trailer will be equipped with 100% of crash recovery equipment used to support 26 different weapon systems with full crash recovery capability.  This trailer must be designed and constructed to be towed across unapproved roadways; the trailer will be required to travel on and off road in conditions that normal vehicles would find difficult to navigate. They developed the "drop frame" trailer systems, which have become a staple in the moving industry Kentucky trailers “drop frame” systems represent significant advances in performance over comparable straight trailers. The salient functional characteristics of Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are essential to the 412 MXS/MXMAPI Crash Recovery operations as follows:

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are built to our specifications.

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers drop frame trailers typically hold 5 - 25 percent more volume than comparable straight trailers which allow us to consolidate 26 different aircraft’s related equipment into one location for better equipment accountability.
 
•	The trailer requested will free up essential personnel and equipment needed to perform other functions during aircraft recovery operations.
   
3.  Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries is the only known corporation that can build a crash recovery trailer to meet our rigid specifications.  Other trailer builders are more suited towards building vehicle trailers that are designed for on-road applications.  Our unique requirement to recover aircraft in locations where rough terrain is the norm rather than the exception require us the have the best possible design and construction possible. 

4.  As an Aircraft Repair Flight practice, we try to avoid Brand Name or Equal situations as much as possible.  There are times however, when due to mission requirements and the lack of companies that provide unique aerospace support, we are sometimes forced to use the Brand Name or Equal process.  We will continue to do our best to try and avoid these situations in the future.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the following questions and answers in response to the original synopsis/solicitation for the RSATS range, Okinawa, Japan. Does the site have electricity?  If so, please give me the voltage and Frequency.  If not, do I need to include the price of an adequately sized generator?  No electricity will be available. This system is to be stand alone. Contractor is to provide all power. See 3.2.3 a. of the PD. Is there any ground work that must be done prior to insta llation?  I will have wiring and some trenching to do.  Will there be equipment available to rent, or should I be prepared to ship everything I need, including large equipment.  No. Also, no trenching is allowed. See 3.2.3 b. of the PD. In section 3.2.2  A - it states that the exposure time must be less than 0.10 seconds. This is not attainable by our lifter, nor any others I have ever seen, is this a realistic number or should it be 1.0 seconds?  The requirement is 0.10 seconds. Early market research indi cated that this was feasible. Also, no questions or concerns were received when the draft SOW and PD containing this requirement were posted to the internet on 18 July 2006. State your best capability in your proposal. Also in 3.2.2  -B-, the target should  react differently when hit than when timed out. What does this mean?  The target will go down in either case, what reaction are you looking for? The circular plates need to go down in one motion when taking a hit and in another when timing out to allow di fferentiation between the two. An example of this would be if the target takes a hit it falls backwards, whereas if it times out, it slides straight down into the hidden position. In 3.2.2  G- States that the target and automated target mechanism shall ta ke a hit and react.  Does this mean the target stand and the 8 circular disk?  Do you want hit sensors on the plate as well as the door, standing frame, and kneeling frame?  We are only interested in the circular plate reacting to hits taken when exposed.
