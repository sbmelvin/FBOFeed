<DESC><p>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.</p>
<p><br />Description:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis data coordinating services and support services for the study of environmental exposure to perfluorinated substances and cancer risk in California from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California (CPIC), 2001 Center Street - Suite 700, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.</p>
<p>The response close date of this notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is to be twelve (12) months from the date of award.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) conducts studies in the United States and abroad to identify and evaluate environmental and workplace exposures that may be associated with cancer risk. <br /><br />OEEB's mission is to combine epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and molecular components into multi-disciplinary studies to provide insight into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Our main research areas include:<br />&bull; Industrial and Occupational Exposures<br />&bull; Environmental Exposures<br />&bull; Exposure Assessment Methods<br /><br />Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were once widely used in commercial and industrial applications. These compounds resist degradation in the environment, and are detectable in serum in ~98% of the U.S. population. One persistent PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible human carcinogen based on animal evidence of liver, testicular, and pancreatic tumors. However, many other PFAS with known toxicity have not been evaluated for carcinogenicity. In occupational studies, PFAS have been associated with non-malignant renal disease and risk of kidney cancer. Consumption of contaminated water was predictive of serum PFAS levels in the C8 Study of mid-Ohio Valley residents living near a manufacturing plant, where PFOA exposure was associated with increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers. The C8 Study of a uniquely exposed population is the only U.S. evaluation of environmental PFOA exposure and cancer risk to-date. No U.S. studies have investigated these relationships with PFAS other than PFOA.</p>
<p>PFAS enter waterways via their manufacture, use, and disposal. Widespread PFAS contamination of U.S. drinking water supplies is documented, but PFAS are not currently regulated in public drinking water. A biomonitoring study in the California Teachers Study (CTS) cohort demonstrated exposure to multiple PFAS, and serum levels were higher in participants who lived in ZIP codes served by a public water supply with PFAS detections (Hurley et al., 2016). This was the first study to relate PFAS in drinking water with body burden in the general population.</p>
<p>The ubiquity and persistence of PFAS exposures and intriguing but limited epidemiologic evidence of their carcinogenicity provides a strong rationale for further cancer studies. The Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts studies of cancer and environmental exposures to drinking water contaminants. DCEG intends to investigate ingestion of PFAS in drinking water and cancer risk in the CTS, leveraging its large numbers of incident cancers, residence histories, and biologic samples. This project will lay the groundwork for studies of PFAS exposure through drinking water and cancer risk by developing a PFAS drinking water exposure assessment. To accomplish this, we plan to link participants' historical residence locations with their drinking water source(s). We will develop a predictive model to estimate PFAS exposures from drinking water (e.g., water consumption, local PFAS point sources, source water characteristics) and will validate these estimates using participants' serum measurements. This novel exposure assessment will set the foundation for future prospective analyses of PFAS and cancer risk.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to support the development of a drinking water exposure assessment for a future study of PFAS and cancer risk among CTS participants. Based on published data in a subset of the CTS population (Hurley et al., 2016), the Government expects PFAS exposures are prevalent. This contract covers support to develop a PFAS exposure assessment that covers all eligible participants of the CTS, with improvement of exposure estimates through model development and incorporation of data from a follow-up survey of some study participants. The results of this study will increase the Government's understanding of the specific PFAS point sources and exposure duration and frequency that may explain the association between PFAS exposures and cancer risk in the general population.</p>
<p>Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />The Contractor shall be involved in the coordination of cohort data approvals, design of exposure assessment questions, the selection of CTS population to target for study, and the initiation of research activities. The specific tasks to be accomplished follow.</p>

<p>The services are provided by the Cancer Prevention Institute of California (CPIC). This NCI-funded study within the CTS cohort is being conducted across the state of California. The CPIC was selected for the current procurement without competition because it has extensive and unique experience in California drinking water data and PFAS that is not available from any other potential contract source. They are in a unique position to conduct the work because they are experts in the CTS, and initiated the original work in PFAS exposures in this cohort that led to the proposed study. The CTS is uniquely suited to this work because the CTS cohort resides across the state of California, where recently published data has indicated PFAS exposures are widespread. Specimens and data from the CTS were collected prospectively before the diagnosis of cancer, making them extremely valuable for research. Unlike many cohorts, the CTS also has fairly complete residential histories, which allows for adequate PFAS exposure assessment infeasible in other studies. Because they previously measured PFAS in serum for other projects, the CTS also already has these data available for epidemiologic analysis. The expertise of the CPIC collaborators and familiarity with the CTS and PFAS data is unique, and their geographic proximity to and familiarity with the study area also make the study feasible in a way not possible to alternative sources for this procurement.</p>

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 and the business size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price, type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: September 30, 2017 through March 30, 2018.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is a research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Division is the world's most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research group. Its renowned epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The Division's research impacts public health policy in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) conducts studies in the United States and abroad to identify and evaluate environmental and workplace exposures that may be associated with cancer risk.</p>
<p>The mutational signatures associated with cigarette smoke provide compelling evidence that environmental exposures can affect genomic architecture in specific ways which in turn, may lead to particular pathways to lung cancer development. Given its unique chemical components, we posit that environmental exposure to smoky coal emissions may contribute to the unique characteristics of lung cancer tissue that are found in non-smoking women from Xuanwei, China by inducing specific mutational signatures. Based on the previous observations, it is highly likely that lung cancer tissue from non-smoking women from Xuanwei will have distinct mutational spectra from the interaction between the distinct components and ratios of components in smoky coal including fine quartz, alkyl PAHs, PAHs, and others. There is no study to our knowledge that has conducted deep whole-genome interrogation of mutational signatures of lung tumors from Xuanwei. Further identifying and characterizing mutational signatures across the entire genome of lung tumor tissue may shed light onto the elusive etiologic mechanism underlying the relationship between smoky coal emissions and elevated lung cancer rates in Xuanwei. At the same time, findings from this study could also inform the coal-related pathogenesis of lung cancer in other rural regions around the world that use bituminous coal in their residences for cooking and heating, in addition to the U.S. where nearly 1,300 coal power plants across the country generate 30-40% of the nation's total electricity output.</p>
<p>The NCI is conducting a study of 25 cases of lung adenocarcinoma from non-smoking women highly exposed to the most carcinogenic smoky coal from Xuanwei, and 5 cases from non-smoking women residing in the same province of Yunnan who did not have any history of exposure to smoky or any other type of coal. Whole genome sequencing of frozen tumor samples (90X) and frozen normal adjacent lung tissue (30X) will be conducted on these samples, and due to restrictions on the export of these biological samples, these analyses must be conducted in China.</p>
<p>The purpose of the procurement is to support the human whole genome sequencing of the 60 frozen tissue samples (30 tumor tissues and 30 adjacent lung tissues) from non-smoking women.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks for frozen tissue sampling:</p>
<p>1. Conduct tumor purity evaluation by using H&amp;E staining of 40 potential tumor samples to identify the 30 tumor samples that have the highest tumor content and that will then be selected for sequencing under this procurement.<br />2. Extract DNA from the selected 30 frozen tumor samples and paired 30 normal frozen tissues.<br />3. Conduct library preparation, human whole genome sequencing (30X, 90 Gb raw data per sample, with HiSeq X PE150) for 30 adjacent lung tissues.<br />4. Conduct library preparation, human whole genome sequencing (90X, 270 Gb raw data, with HiSeq X PE150), and basic analysis for 30 lung tumor tissues. <br />5. Provide raw sequencing data to NCI.<br />6. Conduct basic bioinformatics analysis for the above 60 samples as follows:<br />a. Standard quality control evaluation of sequencing data<br />b. Alignment with reference genome, statistics of sequencing depth and coverage<br />c. SNP/InDel, SV and CNV calling, annotation and statistics<br />d. Somatic SNP/InDel, SV and CNV calling, annotation and statistics (for tumor-normal paired samples)<br />e. Screening for predisposing genes <br />f. Mutational spectrum &amp; mutational signatures <br />g. Driver gene analysis <br />h. Significantly mutated statistical analysis and pathway analysis<br />i. Circos chart analysis</p>
<p>7. Conduct advanced bioinformatics analysis:<br />a. Correlation analysis of significantly mutated genes<br />b. Driver gene prediction<br />c. Display of the distribution of mutation sites<br />d. Identification of significant somatic CNVs <br />e. Fusion gene detection and Circos chart generation<br />f. Tumor purity &amp; ploidy estimation<br />g. Loss of heterozygosity analysis <br />h. Intra-tumor heterogeneity analysis <br />i. Identification of significant mutations in non-coding regions</p>

<p>Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) investigators study individuals at high genetic risk of cancer in order to improve our understanding of cancer etiology and to advance clinical care. This work is carried out through two major research approaches: familial studies and clinical genetics.</p>
<p>The CGB's research mission is to conduct multidisciplinary research to advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer and to translate this knowledge into effective clinical applications for cancer-prone individuals and families, and for individuals at increased risk of cancer from the general population.</p>
<p>Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in the U.S., with an estimated 61,380 new cases and 10,920 deaths expected in 2017. In contrast to the declining trends observed for many cancers, the incidence of endometrial cancer has been increasing over time, with rates projected to double by the year 2030. Obesity is a strong risk factor for endometrial cancer, and data in some populations suggest that increasing rates of endometrial cancer and its precursors mirror the growing prevalence of obesity. Most endometrial cancers develop slowly through progression of well characterized precursors, many of which regress with progesterone treatment or are curable with hysterectomy. Thus, risk prediction and early detection of endometrial cancer precursors could enable prevention of many endometrial cancers and reduce mortality.</p>
<p><br />Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have developed risk prediction models to evaluate endometrial cancer risk based on risk factor data such as BMI and parity. Furthermore, researchers at NCI have conducted molecular profiling studies of endometrial cancers. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that DNA methylation and mutation markers that are present in endometrial cancer tissue are also detectable in tampons and endometrial brushings obtained from the same woman. Additional data suggest that the markers can be detected in endometrial cancer precursors. NCI seeks to collect risk factor information, vaginal tampons and endometrial brushings from women with suspected endometrial cancer and endometrical cancer precursors, and to use these samples to test for DNA methylation and DNA mutation markers. The goal of the project directed by NCI is to use risk factors and molecular markers to predict risk of endometrial cancer and its precursors.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; The contractor shall obtain biological specimens (Tampon, tao brush, tissue) from 175 women attending various clinics in the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology with suspected endometrial cancer or cancer precursors.<br />&bull; The contractor shall abstract risk factor information (including BMI, smoking, hormonal and reproductive risk factors, family history, medications, and history of bleeding, discharge) in an Excel sheet<br />&bull; The contractor shall store the DNA specimens at -70C until methylation and mutation measurement will be conducted by NCI.</p>
<p>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:<br />After completing collection of biological specimens, the contractor shall submit a final report and a database with all collected variables in Excel format.</p>
<p>Deliverables: The deliverables include specimens and data from 200 women attending various clinics. After completing enrollment, the contractor shall transfer the collected data to NCI in Excel format. The specimens shall be stored at the Mayo biospecimen repository until the biomarker testing will be conducted by NCI.</p>
<p>INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:<br />The NCI COR will await confirmation that covariate data have been received by the data managers. After collection of specimens is completed, the NCI COR will await confirmation that samples have been received at the repository. The NCI COR will have one month in which to review and accept delivery. If no comments or request for revisions are provided within one month, the deliverables shall be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>PAYMENT:<br />The contractor shall send bi-monthly invoices according to the number of subjects enrolled.</p>
<p>NET 30 days from date of invoice. Payment shall be made in arrears, after receipt and acceptance of deliverables stated above, and submission of an invoice to the address shown in the order. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoices to the NCI Technical Point of Contact and the NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM), in accordance with the attached payment provisions listed below:</p>
<p>The following clause is applicable to all Purchase Orders, Task or Delivery Orders, and Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Calls: PROMPT PAYMENT (JUL 2013) FAR 52.232-25.</p>
<p><br />These support services are provided by the Mayo Clinic. Together with the proposed contractor, NCI has developed a protocol to sample biospecimens from women at increased risk of endometrial cancer. The NCI has conducted a previous study with the proposed contractor to study risk prediction for endometrial cancer using risk factors and molecular markers and has successfully enrolled over 1000 women into that study. The contractor is uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed tasks for several reasons: (1) Mayo Clinic has pioneered the clinical procedures for this type of research and has successfully enrolled a large number of women into a previous study using these approaches. (2) The Mayo Clinic has an established infrastructure for enrolling patients into clinical studies, sampling blood, and sampling tissues, that was successfully used for the previous study. (3) Mayo nurses and clinicians are trained to use the novel sampling approaches previously established. (4) Conducting the procurement in the same population allows to pool data from the same institution, using the same medical records and follow-up strategies. No other site has this experience and it would require a considerable effort to establish these procedures at other sites, furthermore, performing these tasks at a different institution would not allow to accumulate the results with the previous study, severely limiting the scientific output from this effort.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 5:00PM EDT, on Sept. 14, 2017. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>Ingenuity Variant Analysis is a bioinformatics package that we are using to further process our 460 whole genome data samples. Ingenuity will give us access to their product for one year from activation, which will give us a bioinformatics tool to obtain biological interpretation of the 460 human whole genome data samples. This includes accessing our Whole Genome Sequence from 460 samples to our private cloud, where we will have access to various analyses, including confidence, common variants, predicted deleterious, genetic analysis, statistical association, and biological context such as genetic pathways. These variants can then be linked to Biology using Ingenuity Knowledge Base. This whole genome sequence data will be aligned and will generate called Variants Files. We can share data among all the users in our group.</p>
<p>Ingenuity Variant Analysis is a web--based application that helps us in studying Type 2 Diabetes to identify causal variants from Pima whole genome sequencing data. Ingenuity Variant Analysis combines analytical tools and integrated content to help rapidly identify and prioritize variants by drilling down to a small, targeted subset of variants based both upon published biological evidence and our knowledge of Type 2 Diabetes biology. With Variant Analysis, we have been able to interrogate the variants from multiple biological perspectives, explore different biological hypotheses, and identify the most promising variants for follow-up.

<RESPDATE>091217
<ARCHDATE>09122017
<CONTACT>MELISSA FERRI 562-626-7365
<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego – Seal Beach Detachment intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to Graphic Products, 6445 SW Fallbrook Place, Suite 125, Beaverton, OR 97008. The proposed contract action is to replenish various sizes and colors of the Duralable brand thermal tapes which are used in the existing Duralabel printers’ onsite at Naval Munitions Seal Beach and their detachments.

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The Duralabel brand thermal printing tape is manufactured and distributed solely by Graphic Products.  This tape is the only thermal printing tape which can be used to print signs with the Duralabel printers which are current used onsite.
  NMC requires additional supplies of tape at each location where their printers are in use in order to continue printing safety signs.  Use of these printers was part of NMC’s initiative to comply with Government environmental standards.  NMC was previously generating safety signs via spray paint and stencils which releases toxins into the atmosphere.  Use of the printers eliminates this hazard.  In order to continue use of the printers, the Duralabel brand printer tape must be purchased.  There are no generic substitutes available and the printers will become idle if the specified tape is not used.  This tape is only manufactured and distributed by Graphic Products.   

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties shall submit information that indicates their ability to satisfy this requirement via e-mail to melissa.ferri@navy.mil. Requests must include company name, address, POC name, telephone number, CAGE Code, DUNS number, NAICS code, applicable business size, and Tax ID number. Responses are due by September 12, 2017, 12:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time. 

If no responses are received, FLCSD-Seal Beach will proceed with the sole source award

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads the federal government in conducting and supporting research on aging and the health and well-being of older people. The Institute seeks to understand the nature of aging and the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life. It's mission is to support and conduct genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging, foster the development of research and clinician scientists in aging, provide research resources, and disseminate information about aging and advances in research to the public, health care professionals, and the scientific community among a variety of audiences. NIA does a great deal of computation, instrument data consolidation and analysis and information distribution via database, web and other methods. NIA uses our virtualized servers for this purpose. Per recent changes in federal "data encryption at rest" requirements, NIA must replace our SAN with one that supports the encryption at rest mandate. NIA uses open source virtualization software to run 80+ virtualized computers. Shared storage utilizing ISCSI is required. Our current storage is a HPE 3PAR 7200 SAN.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to provide the NIA with an encrypted ISCSI storage area network machine</p>
<p>Project requirements: <br />The machine must possess the following salient characteristics:<br />&bull;	Shall provide LINUX OVIRT Virtual Machine storage.<br />&bull;	Shall provide at rest data encryption<br />&bull;	Shall provide SSD and HDD storage with data migration<br />&bull;	Shall provide SSD caching for HDD storage, data compression, snapshots and clones. <br />&bull;	Initial sizing shall be ~20TB SSD and ~40TB HDD with the ability to scale over 1PB if required. <br />&bull;	ISCSI connectors shall be 10GB Base T, 10GB optical, or 40GB networking.</p>
<p>Anticipated delivery date: 60 days from date of award</p>
<p>Other important considerations: Machine must be compliant with the Federal "encryption at rest" mandate.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought:</p>
<p>Respondents must provide clear and convincing documentation of their capability of providing the products specificed in this notice.

<p>Finally, respondents are also encouraged to provide a general overview of the respondent's opinions about the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement, and any other information regarding innovative ideas or concepts that may be applicable.</p>
