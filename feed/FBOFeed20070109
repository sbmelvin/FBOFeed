<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Inputs to the Transformational Communications Architecture

General:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information that will help the National Security Space Office (NSSO) / Communications Functional Integration Office (COMM-FIO) updates of the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).  The TCA defines an integrated Department of Defense (DOD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) communications architecture to support national level communications.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DISA is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist DISA in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

1.0 Description.  The purpose of this RFI is to incorporate current and future COMSATCOM capabilities into the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) version 3.  Inputs will be evaluated by a DISA led COMSATCOM working group in support of the NSSO/COMM-FIO.  Opportunities to present inputs or updated information may be arranged at a future point.  Sufficient interest and participation by industry may warrant that materials be discussed in a face-to-face setting or for potential group meetings to reach a consensus on COMSATCOM architecture attributes.

2.0 Background.  The current TCA, version 2, addresses COMSATCOM augmentation to support ongoing and surge bandwidth capacity requirements.  An objective of the planned TCA update will be to address an expanded potential role for COMSATCOM and to leverage emerging commercial satellite capabilities, which would support transformational goals out to the 2020+ timeframe.  The state of the commercial industry will be assessed in several time segments, i.e., near-term (within 5 years from the present), mid-term (10 years out) and far term (2015+).  In order to best accomplish this, DOD requests industry?s assistance through response to this RFI which will constitute commercial industry?s formal opportunity to contribute to an updated TCA.

DOD is soliciting commercial capabilities that can be applied as open architectural solutions to meet specific military needs or opportunities.  These needs and opportunities include but are not limited to:

A.	Mobile Satellite Service
	L-band
	S-band
	Other bands
B.	Fixed Satellite Service
	C-band
	X-band
	Ku-band
	Ka-band
C.	Specific SATCOM applications
	Handheld communications
	Comm-on-the-move (COTM)
	Airborne (aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) communications
	Shipboard communications
	Modem technology
	Antenna technology
	Quality of service applications (QoS)
D. Narrowband netted communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
E. Wideband communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
F. Existing or innovative opportunities and approaches to assure long term access to COMSATCOM services (e.g., pre-positioned leases, hosted payloads, portable capacity, etc.) that provide flexibility, given the uncertainties of DOD operating areas, durations, or funding availability, etc.
G. Available infrastructure (e.g., terrestrial networks, earth terminals, etc.) capabilities and recommendations on whether such capabilities are best leveraged through use of industry organic infrastructure or DOD-specific infrastructure investment

(These needs and opportunities are not intended to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive.) 

3.0 Requested Information.

3.1 Written Responses.  E-mail responses to the questions are due to the Contracting Officer not later than 3:00 p.m. CDT, FRIDAY, 26 JANUARY 2007.  Responses shall be submitted in writing via e-mail only to Pamilla Lazare at pamilla.lazare@disa.mil  and Cindy Showers at cindy.showers@disa.mil.  E-mail responses shall be titled in the subject line of the e-mail as follows:  ?Response to TCA v3 COMSATCOM RFI?.  Responses should be contained in a Microsoft Word (.doc), Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt), or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) document and be as concise as possible.  Shorter, more succinct inputs that clearly demonstrate the military need / opportunity that the capability can address are more valuable than lengthy general responses.

3.2 Proprietary information, if any, should be used sparingly if necessitated and must be clearly marked on the outside container and materials inside.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  DISA intends to utilize contractor support personnel, as listed below, to assist in reviewing and evaluating responses.  If any respondent does not currently have a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) that would permit the Government support contractors listed below to review and evaluate responses to this RFI, the respondent is requested to sign PDPAs with these Government support contractors for this purpose.
	- Northrop Grumman IT (NGIT) / TASC

<SUBJECT>99 -- Unified Energy Case Management System
<SOLNBR>DOL069RP20241
<CONTACT>Paula Miller-Sheelor, Contract Specialist, Phone 202 693-4570, Fax 202 693-4579, Email SHEELOR.PAULA@dol.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) has a need to develop a new case management system for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP).  The new case management system, called the Unified Energy Case Management System (Unified ECMS), will replace the current system, modernize the technical architecture, accommodate new business processes and rules, improve claims processing efficiency, and bring the OWCP technology base into conformance with DOL and federal enterprise architecture standards. 
DOL proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified service providers to design, develop, test, and deploy the Unified ECMS with affordability in mind, ensuring that the system meets all functional, operational, and data and requirements outlined in the forthcoming RFP.  It is anticipated that this contract will be performance based to ensure that DOL performance objectives are achieved, that appropriate performance quality levels are maintained, and that payment is made only for services that meet these levels.  
The contract performance period is anticipated to consist of a base year with two (2) twelve (12) month option years for renewal at the unilateral discretion of the Government.  This solicitation will be a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The applicable NAICS Code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  The solicitation will be made available on or about August 12, 2006 and will be distributed solely through the General Administrations Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  
Background:
The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA) of 2000 is administered by the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) in OWCP that is part of the Energy Standards Administration (ESA) in DOL.  The DEEOIC mission is to deliver benefits to eligible employees and former employees of the Department of Energy (DOE), its contractors and subcontractors, and also to certain survivors of such individuals, as stipulated in the EEOICPA.  The mission also includes delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of Section 5 of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).
The current energy case management system provides authorized program staff with case creation, case action, tracking, querying, payment and report generating capabilities. This system maintains records of claims filed, draft benefit determinations, the adjudicatory status of claims paid and denied, the amount of lump sum payments issued, and the eligibility status for covered medical conditions. Authorized staff can create, verify, certify, authorize, and transmit lump sum compensation payment transactions in the payment module of the EEOICP case management system to establish eligibility and pay benefits.  The systems query function provides authorized DEEOIC staff with ready access to claimant information. The report function in the EEOICP case management system generates case workload management and internal and external reports.  These reports include a set of standardized reports and ad hoc reports that are created to meet specific executive management needs. The system also creates payment eligibility files, which are transmitted using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) technology to facilitate medical bill processing services for OWCP. 
High Level Requirements:
The Unified ECMS will be developed to meet the following high level functional and technical requirements
Functional Requirements:
Develop improved, automated processes that allow users to initiate a claim;
Develop improved, automated processes that allow users to process a claim;
Develop improved, automated processes that support the claims adjudication process;
Develop improved, automated processes that support the claims decision making process;
Develop improved, automated processes that support the compensation payment process;

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Oceanscience Group, 110 Copperwood Way, Suite E, Oceanside, California  92054-3870 for the following Item:  Five (5) each Clamparatus system for mounting ATON for type 8 x 24 USCG buoy.  Option Item to purchase an additional five (5) each of the Clamparatus System.  The delivery time for the first five units is February 1, 2007.  Option item to be purchased during the period of 1/18/2007, or date of award, whichever is later, through 1/17/2008.  Items to be delivered FOB Destination to NOAA/NOS, Requirements & Development Division, 808 Principal Court, Chesapeake, VA  23320l.  In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The FSC for this is 2040 and the NAICS Code is 334511, small business size standard is 750 employees.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  Oceanscience Group is the only known source capable of providing the required equipment.  Oceansciences designed and built this mount prior to use by NOAA.  Oceanscience owns the design.  This is the only known design that has been accepted by the US Coast Guard for use on their Buoys.  The required mounting system specifications:  use of a multiple module design (ADCP, power pack, radio module) to ease installation; mount modules so as to minimize fasteners; eliminate corrosion (use non-metallic components or isolate dissimilar metals); make use of identical paints; have negligible effect on buoyancy.  The device doesn?t alter the form or function of a navigational buoy, while still providing current profiles from the buoy.  The ADCP and clamping mechanism are attached to the USCG aid to Navigation (buoy) after it is deployed and removed prior to buoy recovery for maintenance.  The battery operated device needs to be services only once a year to remove fouling and installation of new batteries.  A low powered radio link to a close point ashore provides data access..  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. January 17, 2007 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.

The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 07 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB and .13% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) requires the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Section C  Statement of Objectives for Guard Recruiting Assistance Program C-1	GENERAL C-1.1	Background The National Guard Bureaus Army Strength Maintenance Divisions (NGB-ASM) mission is to provide policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the states and territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Ph ilosophy.  Specifically, to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrition management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-serv ice.   The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for strength readiness between unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force.  Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet each units strength objectives.  The three ten ets of strength maintenance are: q	Recruiting:  Recruiting Quality (Non-Prior and Prior Service) Soldiers q	Retention:  Retaining Soldiers who reach their Expiration Term of Service (ETS) q	Attrition Management:  Reducing Losses While Still Under Contractual Military Obligation In September of 2005 the Army National Guard tasked Docupak under the existing Marketing Contract to support the Lead Generation Program, which has evolved into the Guard Recruiting Assistance Program (G-RAP). Currently, all support for this program is tas ked using  the Marketing contract. The G-RAP program has been authorized as two successive delivery orders of the Marketing Contract with Docupak. The services available under this contract were broadly based and could include research; program development and production; curriculum develop ment and production; development and production of training programs and multimedia materials; the packaging and distribution of program and multimedia materials; and maintaining a database with sensitive data; maintaining a management database for reporti ng and status. The Army National Guard acquired these individual services or products from a contractor on a task order by task order basis.   The Army Guard Strength Maintenance Division plans to continue the G-RAP program but is not necessarily committed to replicating them in the program in its current form, organization, staffing levels, or business processes. That is, Army Guard Strength Mai ntenance Division will consider alternatives, improvements, and enhancements over the long term. In that regard, NGB-ASM intends to use incentives to induce superior contractor performance. That is, tasks under the new contract, to the extent appropriate, will be  performance-based. As part of these activities, the Army National Guard also has a related objective which is capture and improve access to performance data and program data. Some of the key steps within the NGB Army Strength Maintenance process of Recruiting are shown in the following diagram.  This diagram indicates the flow of new potential soldiers to become combat-ready soldiers within the National Guard.  It indicates how  the Recruiting Assistants participate in the process of recruiting, and are compensated to help achieve the end-strength objective.  The Army National Guard has multiple related yearly objectives that it uses while managing these processes so as to achiev e the Congressionally mandated end-strength objective. A summary of the NGB-ASM Recruiting process, along with the current G-RAP compensation milestones, are shown in Attachment 1.  The Army Guard Strength Maintenance Division requires contractor support services to continue, improve, and expand current efforts to create and develop innovative recruitment programs consistent with the Strength Maintenances three tenets of Recruitment,  Retention, and Managing Attrition. These recruitment programs respond to ARNGs foremost goal, which is to attain and maintain congressionally authorized end-strength. In particular, this solicitation c ontinues the Guard Recruiting Assistance Program (G-RAP) program and tasks established under the Marketing Contract.  NGB-AQ Contracting Division has determined that a new single award contract is the most effective way to achieve NGB-ASM goals for G-RAP. Consistent with performance-based contracting practices, NGB-ASM has to define the work in terms of objectives rather than specific tasks. As a result, it is then the Offerors responsibility to propose how the stated objectives would be achieved and to de fine the metrics to measure performance.   Of significant importance are:  Proposing a Recruitment Assistant payment plan that takes into consideration deployment-based, geographically-based and skill-based demand variables, proposing incentive plans for t he recruiters, and proposing training and associated training reimbursement plans for the recruiters. C-1.2	Purpose  The G-RAP contract tasking period of performance expires in March of 2007.  However, the Army Guard Strength Maintenance Division wants services continued with only minimal disruption.  Due to its visibility, success, and cost, NGB-ASM has determined that G-RAP requires a separate contracting vehicle and separate funding. This is because the G-RAP program is unique due to the combination of components that make it successful: it motivates  Guardsman monetarily for recruiting enlistees, provides the Guardsman with recruitment training, and motivates them to stay in contact with the enlistee through completion of basic training. Additionally, G-RAP monitors and measures the performance of ind ividual recruiting Guardsmen and overall G-RAP program performance.  By directive, the Government expects agencies, including NGB-ASM, to implement Performance-based Services Acquisitions, if appropriate. The Army Guard Strength Maintenance Division believes that performance-based tasks are desirable and consistent with Arm y National Guard goals and objectives, which are performance metric based. This contract will implement performance-based tasks where appropriate. The establishment of this performance-based IDIQ contract is for the express purpose of obtaining a single award contract to a contractor capable of providing management, supervision, personnel, material and equipment to plan, create, design, produce, plac e, evaluate and measure the effectiveness of G-RAP.  G-RAP is a successful program which is currently supporting Recruiting and Retention Non-Commissioned Officers (RRNCOs) in their mission to maintain the National Guards congressionally authorized end-st rength.   The effectiveness in meeting these objectives will be demonstrated through the use of performance metrics proposed by the offerors.   NGB-ASM expects the contractor will provide an organization and project manager who will be responsible for all contractor work performed under this solicitation and who is the single point of contact.  Notwithstanding the other effort under this solicitat ion, the contractor will create a persistent organization to support the project manager in the day-to-day operations, including, but are not limited to monitoring, supervision, directing, planning, collecting, and reporting metrics, and quality assurance.   NGB-ASM anticipates that the contractor would provide the full complement of skills required in this solicitation.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.After extensive testing, the HP servers were the only servers found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>HP CTO FACTORY BUILT CONFIGURATIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR>ALL SERVER CONFIGURATIONS MUST BE FULLY INTEGRATED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT<BR><BR>REPOSTED TO INCLUDE TERMS: 1) CTO ACCEPBABLE 2) ALL SERVER COMPONENTS MUST BE INTEGRATED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY.<BR><BR>AMENDED LINE ITEMS 002, 004, 008 & 011.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Modification 02: This modification is being issued to incorporate Attachment 3 to this announcement. (End of Modification) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is upgrading the NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) for improved operations.  The existing wind profilers are vertical looking radars, the deployment of which commenced in approximately 1990.  The existing wind profilers operate continuously and provide upper air wind data which the NWS uses in a variety of ways.  In upgrading the NPN, the NWS expects to improve the resolution of wind phenomena in time and space (horizontal and vertical) and accuracy; enhance end-to-end observing system availability, access, archive, quality assurance, and timeliness monitoring; and to make use of the real-time wind profiles as an integrating sensor for a seamless system of systems.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 will be issued on or about November 3, 2006 and will close on or about February 2, 2007.  This solicitation will encompass a development phase culminating in the delivery, installation, and testing of a first article wind profiler, followed by a production phase involving delivery and installation of up to 54 wind profilers.  [It is expected that all installations will take place within the United States.]  Additionally, the production phase will provide for initial sparing and initial maintenance of the wind profilers (until the wind profilers are transitioned to Government maintenance).  Both the development and production phases will include provisions for associated services, such as training, and associated supplies, including documentation.  The solicitation will allow for either the upgrade of the existing wind profilers or the replacement of the existing wind profilers.  The solicitation will be structured to allow for up to two awards for the development phase, with a down-select to one contractor for the production phase; however, the Government will not be obliged to make two awards for the development phase.  The Government expects that completion of the work called for by the solicitation will take place within five years after award.  All responsible sources may respond to Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 by submitting a proposal which shall be considered by NOAA.  See Notes 12 and 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to provide responses to additional questions received.

1)The draft PWS does not include a task for Mission Planning.  Will this be included?  Yes, this will be included in the final PWS.  2)The twenty page limit for Volume II, Contractor?s Technical Proposal may be inadequate to provide concise background on proposed number of personnel.  Will there be key personnel/key positions identified?  At this time, we have not decided if key personnel/key positions will be identified.
3)CLIN 3001 is identical to CLIN 3034.  Is this correct?  No, CLIN 3034 should be for Project Planning Management Support.
4)CLIN 0001, Mobilization; does this refer to possible world-wide deployability of support?  Mobilization is for any costs associated with transitioning to begin work by the date required.
5)What are the challenges 9 RW is currently experiencing?  Overall, the largest is cost constraints and budget reductions throughout the Air Force.  In operations and mission support, the challenge is flexibility of overseas/TDY staffing.  In training and scheduling, the challenge has been identifying and preventing confusion on the chain of command.
6)Is the customer willing to use technology to improve processes? Yes.

<DESC>Modification 01:  There was an error in the initial posting.  The following information was intended to be a Request for Information (RFI) coded as a Source Sought Notice, however, was incorrectly posted as a Presolicitation Notice.  Please note this change as it is intended to be a RFI. (End of Modification)
The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) seeks sources and information on how GIS shapefile or image based flood forecast showing flood extent could be brought to the general public in an efficient manner.  

Traditionally, NWS provides forecasts of river stages on our Nation?s rivers and streams in textual format, or with graphics showing river heights versus time (hydrographs).  To improve services to the people of the United States of America, NOAA/ NWS, Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) have developed prototype flood forecast maps using geoprocessing software to produce GIS shapefiles or images.  The shapefiles or images display an expected flood extent based on forecast water surface profiles as simulated by the NWS hydraulic model FLDWAV.  Deterministic or probabilistic based flood forecast files can be produced every 6 hours on a daily basis, several times per day.  The spatial extent of the shapefiles/images focuses on certain portions along selected rivers within the United States of America and its Territories where hydraulic modeling has been developed and the appropriate detailed topographic data is available.

Submissions shall address one or several of the following salient topics:

1) Express a business interest in creating, storing and/or distributing flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or in using flood forecast shapefiles/images.

2) Provide (technical) information and sources regarding creation, storage and/or distribution of flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or on potential uses of flood forecast shapefiles/images.

3) Provide information on options for:
a) Nature of the shapefiles/images delivered by the Government, whether it should be in interim or final display formats including whether the images should be pre-generated and stored or generated on the fly.
b) Whether or not the Government should provide shapefiles/images to a third party who would then distribute to the public.
c) Estimated scale and costs

4) Interest in collaborations with NWS to publish flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or to use flood forecast shapefiles/images.

Vendors who believe they can meet one or some of the requirements are requested to submit in writing a response demonstrating that they can meet the Government's requirements.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed (technical) information and other (technical) literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Written responses must be received by February 10, 2007. This is not a request for proposal but rather a vehicle for obtaining information.  Responses should provide a point of contact, including representative name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number.  Questions and responses shall be sent via e-mail in Microsoft Word format to: Brian.J.Brown@noaa.gov and Reggina.Cabrera@noaa.gov .  No telephone requests will be honored.  The Government will not incur any cost as a result of this announcement.

<CONTACT>Gregory.Dougherty@navy.mil
<DESC>This modification to N0002407R5104 includes an excel file with all the excel attachments.  This Request for Information supersedes all other RFI and Sources Sought requests issued under N0002407R5401 THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (TSD) Orlando is surveying the vendor community for potential sources for Non-Developmental Items (NDI)/Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) options for a shipboard Total Ship Training System (TSTS) as required by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS) 7C. The Total Ship Training System (TSTS) is based on a framework for implementing training capabilities that support planning, conduct, assessment and the management of information. The TSTS is a Naval Open Architecture (NOA) compliant System-of-Systems (SoS) that as envisioned will provide common services, integrated training support components, functionally distinct trainer components such as the Combat System Trainer, and standalone training tools and aids to support both the trainer and trainee, in single ship, multi-ship and joint training environments. Respondents should offer an assessment of the technical maturity level of their product(s) using the Product Self Assessment Matrix available below.   It is noted that the information provided will be reviewed by non-government Contractor Support Personnel.  These personal have signed non-disclosure agreements concerning their support of the program. The areas of interest addressed in this Sources Sought are: 1.	Planning 2.	Scenario Generation & Control (SG&C)and Modeling 3.	Data Collection  4.	After Action Review (AAR) 5.	Knowledge Management (KM) The flow of data begins in the Knowledge Management component where the training objectives are determined. The Planning component defines the criteria for a scenario that will meet the training objectives. This criteria is used by the Scenario Generation & Control tool to produce a training scenario. The training scenario is then used to drive an exercise, stimulating various training systems to produce data.  This information is captured by the Data Collection tool for use by the After Action Review component where it is evaluated against the training objectives.  Resulting information is fed back into the Knowledge Management component which updates the training records.     Planning  The products will automate the planning process by using formal training objectives to develop a training package, which includes a training narrative and script, and supports data collection, AAR and debrief.  The training situations and training complexity will be tailored to meet specific ship/team training requirements matched to the experience level of the individual or team. SG&C  The products will implement a robust, scaleable, and highly adaptive scenario script generation capability that supports all shipboard training areas; enhances scenario quality/realism while minimizing the complexity and time required for generating a scenario through distributed scenario generation. Data Collection  The products will collect, time-tag, and fuse ground truth and perceived truth scenario data along with operator actions, provide filtering capability to focus in on specific areas of interest and on specific performance metrics using appropriate scales and compared to approved standards. AAR - The products will support rapid isolation to areas of interest and have the ability to drill down (tracing an outcome result to a process/action cause) to information needed to support the teams individual and collective awareness of what went right, what went wrong and what can be done about it. KM  The products functionality is an important part of TSTS in supporting the trainer throughout the planning, conduct, and assessment process, and the trainee during AAR. KM will integrate/streamline the plan, conduct, analysis and AAR functions resulting in more effective and efficient training. The KM capability will provide a continuous on-line aid throughout the training process that can take in requirements and provide tailored products to authorized internal and external information to users. TSTS KM will be interoperable with internal systems and external KM capabilities. Additional information to consider when responding to this Sources Sought: 	A goal of the system is to increase training team and supervisor automation and reduce training administrative overhead. 	TSTS will be procured using an iterative spiral strategy as a system of systems.   	NDI/COTS software and equipment is the acquisition goal for TSTS. 	TSTS goal is to interface with or provide training for other subsystems such as combat systems, engineering, navigation, shiphandling, visit boarding search and seizure, anti-terrorism/force protection, medical, security force, aviation and logistics. 	TSTS will be portable between ship classes with ship-specific functionality left to the subsystems. 	TSTS will maintain simulation models of own ship as well as other entities in a synthetic computing environment.   	TSTS will follow a plan/conduct/assess methodology. 	TSTS will satisfy current network operational security requirements and certification operating up to SECRET/NOFORN. 	TSTS will incorporate an extensible, scalable architecture that will support future mission spaces and changes to current mission spaces. 	TSTS will fit into a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach, providing services to and accepting services from other systems. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, located at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the potential Offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  This is a Sources Sought, and feedback from industry is also sought on our requirements as stated in this synopsis.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Interested parties are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 3 pages in length for each applicable Self Assessment Matrix, and demonstrate their ability to provide the requirements listed above.  All data received in response to these sources sought, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government.  Capability statements must be submitted electronically to t!  he Contract Specialist in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) and Self Assessment Matrix spreadsheets must be submitted as unlocked MS Excel spreadsheets to the following email address: Gregory.Dougherty@navy.mil Telephone and other means of oral communication requesting information will not be permitted.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION: To clarify the background information and the page limit for responses to subject RFI. BACKGROUND:  Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devise Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems are currently being used in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) efforts.  CREW systems are being utilized by soldiers from all branches of the United States Military to defeat the increasing Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats while performing their duties.  As DODs demand for spectrum use and associated interference de-confliction has increased, the need has risen for CREW systems to become highly compatible with the Blue Force Communications systems (BF COMMS).  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to identify technically mature systems, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, that could potentially satisfy the compatibility/interoperability between existing and future ground CREW and BF COMMS systems.  OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS: It is expected that compatibility systems will make it possible for Military forces to operate any CREW system effectively while simultaneously operating BF COMMS in the same vehicle and adjacent vehicles. BF COMMS consist of numerous systems in dismounted and mounted configurations based on common radio transceivers (RT).  Some of the more common RTs / applicable configurations /  waveform or system names are:  RT-1694D / AN/PRC-150, AN/VRC-104(V) / (Harris) HF ALE; RT-1796 / AN/PRC-117F, AN/VRC-103V1 / (Harris) TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1523(V) / AN/PRC-119(V), AN/VRC-87,88,89,90,91,92(V) / (ITT GD) SINCGARS; RT-1672 / AN/PSC-5 / SPITFIRE; RT-1672C / AN/PSC-5C / SHADOWFIRE; RT-1672D / AN/PSC-5D / (Raytheon) MBMMR, TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1720 / EPLRS; AN/PRC-148(V) / (Thales) MBITR, JEM, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS;  Blue Force Tracking (BFT) Systems; Movement Tracking System (MTS); and Global Positioni!  ng Systems (GPS) PLGR and DAGR.

The  identifying number is RFQ-OH-07-0001. The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13. The NAICS code is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this  RFQ..   The US EPA Office of Research and Development located in Ada, Oklahoma has a requirement for an automated physisorption analyzer that is capable of meeting or exceeding the following specifications: Technical Specifications of the Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer "	The surface  area and pore size analyzer and/or its components should be capable of preparing samples, analyzing samples, acquiring and analyzing data, and summarizing data. "	The surface area and pore size analyzer and its components should be fully automated and controlled by a desktop/laptop computer  separate from the instrument. [An instrument run by a separate computer is advantageous in that if problems occur with the computer controlling the instrument, it can be easily fixed or replaced without much expense, whereas, an integrated instrument (i.e., a computer and instrument all in one)  would not.] "	At a minimum, the surface area and pore size analyzer should be capable of performing the following analyses: o	Adsorption and desorption isotherms o	Single and multipoint B.E.T. surface area o	Langmuir surface area o	B.J.H. pore size distribution o	Micropore volume and  micropore distribution by the MP and t-plot methods o	Total surface area. [These are the standard analyses needed for research conducted at the lab.] "	Options for sample preparation (i.e., outgassing) should include both: o	Vacuum combined with heat o	Flowing gas [Outgassing of samples using  vacuum combined with heat is advantageous to research at the lab involving activated carbon, while outgassing using flowing gas is advantageous to research involving green rust, which can be physically altered by excessive heat.] "	Sample tubes should be capable of maintaining a vacuum, as would  be the case if outgassing using vacuum combined with heat, or an inert atmosphere, as would be the case if outgassing using flowing gas.  Sample tubes must maintain the vacuum or inert atmosphere until the sample is transferred and loaded into the analyzer without exposure to the atmosphere. [The  ability to maintain the vacuum or inert atmosphere is a necessity for research at the lab involving green rust because green rust quickly corrodes when exposed to an oxygen atmosphere.] "	The surface area and pore size analyzer should also adhere closely to the following technical  specifications: o	Vacuum system - "	Two independent vacuums [Assuming that a non-integrated analyzer is purchased, one vacuum would be needed for sample preparation and the other for sample analysis] "	Vacuum pump power 100-240 V [Standard power range] o	Pressure measurement - "	Range of 0 to  1000 mmHg "	Minimum Relative Pressure of 6 x 10-5 "	Sample Pressure Resolution ? 0.05 mmHg o	Specific surface area range -  "	0.1 m2/g and higher using N2 o	Gas inlets - "	Multiple inlets (e.g., N2, He, CO2, Ar, Kr, etc.) [Multiple inlets allow for physisorption experimentation using  alternate gases.] o	Analysis ports - "	? Three [A greater the number of analysis ports allow for a greater throughput of samples] o	Outgas ports - "	External from surface area analyzer [A surface area analyzer with external outgas ports is advantageous in that if problems occur with the  outgassing ports, the external outgassing unit could be easily fixed or replaced without much expense, whereas, a surface area analyzer integrated with outgas ports would not.] "	= Six [A greater the number of outgas ports allow for a greater throughput of samples] The Government will evaluate  and make the award based "best overall value".

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  CA/CST requires the Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner for use with US visa programs.  For the past few years, fingerprint scanners have been a component of the US Governments biometric initiative to prevent the processing of duplicate applications with altered personal information (name, place of birth, date of birth, etc.) and the subsequent issuance of visas based on fraudulent data.  Recently, the US Congress mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic. In coordination with the FBI, Consular Affairs is scheduled to pilot 10-fingerprint capture at US Consulates in Islamabad in January 2007.  Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanners are required for this project.  The Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F. The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers.<BR><BR>CA requires that any scanner selected for the pilot must meet the following software compatibility requirements: -The scanner must be able to function as a replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 CHECK fingerprint scanner and as an alternative to the Cross Match Guardian fingerprint scanner. -The scanner must be evaluated against the current ten-print capture scanner and software requirements specifications. -The scanner must meet FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) EFTS (electronic fingerprint transmission specification) Appendix F certification requirements. -The scanner must have an API (application programming interface) available for integration into custom applications such as TPLS (Ten Print Live Scan). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner requested without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanners has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

Within the U.S. Census Bureau, the Economic Planning and Coordination Division (EPCD) has a requirement for advisory and assistance services in order to maintain and improve coverage of complex multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The Business Register serves as the enumeration list for the economic census and as a sampling frame for economic surveys.  It is also used for the storage of administrative data.  The desired improvements include the improvement and expansion on the 2002 implementation of the redesigned Business Register.  

The major objectives of this project focus on more complete and up-to-date coverage of complex multi-units; improved representation of multilevel and multidimensional organization hierarchies; the addition of statistical units for subsidiary companies, divisions and other intermediate units; expanded use of Federal administrative records and other alternatives to direct collection; increased effectiveness and reduced burden for the annual Company Organization Survey (COS); improved efficiency for register maintenance operations; and strengthened support for the economic censuses? and survey?s efforts to measure this critical part of the business population.  The results of this work will support EPCD?s maintenance and coverage of the multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The Census Bureau has obtained this support in the past from Alfred R. Brand, Jr.

Interested parties should submit a detailed statement of their qualifications, not exceeding 15 pages, for providing the required support by e-mail to Maxine R. Hodges at Maxine.R.Hodges@census.gov by 3:00 pm, EST, Friday, January 19, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (TSD) Orlando is surveying the vendor community for potential sources for Non-Developmental Items (NDI)/Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) options for a shipboard Total Ship Training System (TSTS) as required by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS) 7C. The Total Ship Training System (TSTS) is based on a framework for implementing training capabilities that support planning, conduct, assessment and the management of information. The TSTS is a Naval Open Architecture (NOA) compliant System-of-Systems (SoS) that as envisioned will provide common services, integrated training support components, functionally distinct trainer components such as the Combat System Trainer, and standalone training tools and aids to support both the trainer and trainee, in single ship, multi-ship and joint training environments. Respondents should offer an assessment of the technical maturity level of their product(s) using the Product Self Assessment Matrix available below.   It is noted that the information provided will be reviewed by non-government Contractor Support Personnel.  These personal have signed non-disclosure agreements concerning their support of the program. The areas of interest addressed in this Sources Sought are: 1.	Planning 2.	Scenario Generation & Control (SG&C)and Modeling 3.	Data Collection  4.	After Action Review (AAR) 5.	Knowledge Management (KM) The flow of data begins in the Knowledge Management component where the training objectives are determined. The Planning component defines the criteria for a scenario that will meet the training objectives. This criteria is used by the Scenario Generation & Control tool to produce a training scenario. The training scenario is then used to drive an exercise, stimulating various training systems to produce data.  This information is captured by the Data Collection tool for use by the After Action Review component where it is evaluated against the training objectives.  Resulting information is fed back into the Knowledge Management component which updates the training records.     Planning  The products will automate the planning process by using formal training objectives to develop a training package, which includes a training narrative and script, and supports data collection, AAR and debrief.  The training situations and training complexity will be tailored to meet specific ship/team training requirements matched to the experience level of the individual or team. SG&C  The products will implement a robust, scaleable, and highly adaptive scenario script generation capability that supports all shipboard training areas; enhances scenario quality/realism while minimizing the complexity and time required for generating a scenario through distributed scenario generation. Data Collection  The products will collect, time-tag, and fuse ground truth and perceived truth scenario data along with operator actions, provide filtering capability to focus in on specific areas of interest and on specific performance metrics using appropriate scales and compared to approved standards. AAR - The products will support rapid isolation to areas of interest and have the ability to drill down (tracing an outcome result to a process/action cause) to information needed to support the teams individual and collective awareness of what went right, what went wrong and what can be done about it.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Notice of Conference.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that can design, develop, manufacture, integrate hardware and software, test and support components for a Next Generation Visual Landing Aid (NGVLA) system).  The NGVLA is intended to be the Navy?s newest shipboard Visual Landing Aid system capable of guiding the present and future naval rotary wing aircraft along with Unmanned Air Vehicles for safe landings.  The NGVLA is being developed for forward fit into the DDG1000 class destroyers, with potential applications for other future surface combatants[mw1] .  The major design objectives for the NGVLA are: improve reliability, reduce maintenance & manpower, meet specific requirements of the DDG1000 functionality, mounting configurations, power and controls, lower radar cross section, and meet Night Vision Device compatibility requirements.  Proposed performance parameters for the new NGVLA will be sent to interested parties upon request from the Naval Air Engineering Station Contracting Officer on a CD.  The NGVLA program will reflect a system?level acquisition approach for three new components of the total system, which will each be contracted separately.  The Navy?s goal is to develop and procure an entire NGVLA system (Multi Multi-Function Display (MFD), new Stabilized Glideslope Indicator (SGSI), and a new Flight Deck Lighting (FDL) system with associated interfaces.). Contracts for each component development and test are anticipated with follow-on options for production quantities and Logistics support. The government intends to structure a program that is economically feasible while meeting the needs of the fleet.  This may result in the contractor(s) pricing out one or more of the NGVLA components as a Modified Cots option. The SGSI is composed of a stabilized optical projector which projects Green-Yellow-Red[mw2]  beams of light corridors for pilots to receive a visual cue of correct glideslope.  In the Night Vision Device mode[mw3] , the pilots will receive pulse coded signals for proper glideslope approach. The MFD consists of a ?bill-board? type display mounted on the ship?s superstructure above the hangar doors. The MFD will present a horizon reference bar and deck status indication[mw4] , with capability for future expansion. The FDL is composed of all of the deck lighting and other approach and obstruction indicators required for US Navy aviation certification. All of the control for power, brightness/dimming, fault indication, and status display will be interfaced through the ships Total Ships Computing Environment Infrastructure ( TSCEI ) system. Operator control functions will be provided by the ship?s CEDS displays.  Interface to the ships data distribution for control and interface will be specified in the respective component specifications[mw5] .  The development effort is anticipated to be conducted through an Integrated Product Team (IPT) structure. The IPT will consist of [mw6] the contractor/ NGVLA component designordesigner, the ship builder and NAWC Lakehurst NGVLA team members.    The first phase to be executed is the Development phase. During the Development phase, contractors will develop program plans, Develop develop and produce the System Development & Demonstration SDD hardware, and test to prove compliance with specification requirements.  A single contract will be awarded for the (SDD) phase (formally Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) phase[mw7] ) through a fully integrated, production representative system for Technical and Operational Evaluation. (plus additional subsystems/ components required to support environmental and shock qualification of the system components). The SDD system may initially be tested at the NAWCADLKE Test Site. Following successful completion of an initial Developmental Test (DT) program, the system may be refurbished and installed aboard the DDG1000. [SMS8]   The SDD phase will begin in FY 07 and continue into FY 08 (18 months[mw9] ). The test Test and integration Integration phase is expected to last for 36 months, including shipboard install and test. Following a successful test at the land based test site or test facility and shipboard testing, a sole source contract for production quantities will be awarded to support DDG1000 class ship availabilities and possible other class installations. The production option contract is anticipated to be a sole source, fixed price incentive (FPI) contract for production units including technical and logistic data to support DDG1000 class installation availabilities.  Options will be included to support the DDG1000 construction schedule. 

 The Navy will host an Industry Briefing at NAWCAD Lakehurst, New Jersey on or about February 13 & 14, 2007 to discuss the program goals and technical requirements, present government information, anticipated scope of effort and background and to answer questions.  Draft copies of the program plan, SOW Statement of Work (SOW) and Specifications system performance specifications for each respective component will be available prior to the meeting upon request.  Specific meeting location and agenda will be provided pending receipt of participant?s request to attend.  If you plan to attend the industry brief, please submit a fax to the Contracting Officer at (732) 323-4822 with the company name/address, names and positions of attendees, and citizenship of attendees.

<DESC>1.  United States Transportation Command is seeking information that will help the Agency explore options for providing global container management capability.  THIS IS ONLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) to identify sources and capabilities to provide global container management capability. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  A government requirement to provide these services is being developed, and a solicitation may or may not result.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) is included as follows:  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of business organizations interested in this requirement.

The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.     Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  

2.  Description.  Global Container Management (GCM) requirements include ensuring the Department of Defense (DOD) owns and can lease enough International Standards Organization (ISO) containers to meet contingency requirements while efficiently managing those containers when they are not in use. Containers used to deploy and sustain DOD and non-DOD customers around the world are government-owned (GO), government-leased (GL), or furnished by a transportation carrier.  Carrier- furnished (CF) containers may themselves be owned or leased by the carrier.  Containers are 20? and 40? dry, refrigerated (reefer), and high-cube (102? tall).  Another CM requirement is training users in the Integrated Booking System ? Container Management Module (IBS-CMM, hereafter referred to as CMM), a web-based centralized data base written in Microsoft Access, both in CONUS and theaters; during peace time and contingencies.    

2.1. Container Management in Theater.  SDDC uses military and commercial ships, truck, and rail to deliver containers into theaters of operation. They are then moved to destination via the theater distribution system. Containers delivered by commercial liner ships may become military responsibility upon clearing customs or only after the carrier has delivered to a specific consignee location (?door delivery?). CF containers delivered by liner ships accrue detention after the expiration of free time carriers allow. It is not cost effective to return all containers to sea-worthy condition nor return all sea-worthy containers to the Continental United States (CONUS). Combatant commanders may retain a portion of GO containers for future contingency or theater transload purposes. Containers remaining in theater must be stored, accounted for, tracked in a container management system, certified for sea movement (if required), tracked when moved, and reported on as required. In CENTCOM SDDC established a Container Management Element (CME) to exercise that direct authority while in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The CME functions under the operational control of CENTCOM via the CENTCOM Deployment & Distribution Operations Center (DDOC).

2.2. CONUS Container Management includes the inventory, tracking, accounting, maintenance, and certification of and reporting on GO and GL containers at power projection platforms (PPPs) and depots throughout CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii.  Inclusive is to program, budget, and fund GO containers for life-cycle costs. Container managers find efficient uses for idle containers such as short-term leasing.  

2.3. The contractor?s authority and responsibility for container management flow from SDDC?s role as the DOD Global Container Manager.  SDDC, in coordination with DOD Components, exercises direct authority over common user containers.  DOD container managers use CMM to: maintain in-transit and intra-theater visibility of all containers, manage GO and GL container pools, reduce detention and leasing costs by returning containers to owners, and produce standardized reports and performance metrics on theater container status for all activities.  The contractor will employ Container Management Teams (CMTs) at key nodes throughout theaters to maintain container inventory and accountability record quality and to provide for direct contact with container users and transporters.  Control, prioritization, and physical handling and movement of containers remain the responsibility of theater movement control elements and mode operators, who are to provide daily in/out gate and transload reports to the CME via CMM. The contractor will perform all CME responsibilities except those reserved to unit and agency movement control and distribution personnel.  In performing those responsibilities the contractor will interface with DDOC and component commander container managers.   

3. Requested Information.  Provide written responses to the Contracting Office not later than 12:00 p.m. CST 22 Jan 07.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Ms. Tamara Schuette at tamara.schuette@ustranscom.mil.  Subject line of the e-mail shall read:  Response to Container Management RFI.

<DESC>The Bureau is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features in U.S. currency. Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats, including both traditional printing and digital reproduction. Proposed features may be incorporated into the note (inks, substrate), or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any device for verification.

Any technologies or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other production/processing requirements. An effective feature is defined as a feature that cannot be easily simulated or duplicated; for example, a feature that can be simulated to approximate a passable outward appearance or response of a genuine feature is not effective or acceptable.

Additionally, the Bureau is interested in reviewing products, materials, and technologies that will enhance the usefulness of currency notes; for example, authentication/denomination features for the visually impaired and enhancement of circulation life.

Current versions of currency paper and ink specifications, as well as durability testing procedures, are available upon written request.

The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials, for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e., means a proven concept, can provide a sample). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus price information for the purchase of larger test quantities to the BEP, Office of Procurement, Attn: Larry McCain, 14th and C Sts, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20228. Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further assessment. The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted. If you have any questions please contact Larry McCain on (202) 874-0133 or via e-mail at larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov.

<ARCHDATE>01092008
<CONTACT>Amanda J Kreusch, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 286-5091, Fax (301) 286-0357, Email amanda.j.kreusch@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA is contemplating awarding a contract to supply a Sabatier-reaction based carbon dioxide reduction system that will be operated in a service based model as part of the International Space Stations (ISS) Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) currently in development and operation on the ISS.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify any potential commercial companies that could provide this service.   This contract will provide a service by supplying flight hardware and operational support for a Sabatier system onboard the ISS to enabling the ability to create water from the byproducts of the ECLSS Oxygen Generation System (OGS) and Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA).   The Sabatier system must operate integrated with the OGS and CDRA. The contractor will be given NASAs interface and acceptance requirements but NASA will not be involved other than insight to ensure safety.  NASA will not participate in any design reviews or impose any specifications on the design except for those defined in supplied safety, interface and acceptance requirements.  The contractor will develop, procure, and build flight hardware, support equipment needed for operations, and training material within a schedule to meet delivery at least 6 months before the currently scheduled ISS assembly mission 20A which has a current manifest planning date of January 2010.  If the contractor chooses another delivery schedule the flight hardware will need to meet the launch requirements for the proposed launch vehicle.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be for a minimum of five years of on orbit operations plus the time proposed for development and launch delivery.	The contractor will provide the capability for on-orbit maintenance including maintenance and logistics planning and provision of spare parts.  NASA will be interested in contract models that would allow the service contract to have a period of performance for longer periods of time.     NASA is willing to consider contract models that include fixed price service performance-based contracts with the first payment upon proof of operations on-orbit or the possibility of final acceptance ground testing with the majority of payments contingent upon on-orbit performance criteria.	Payment schedules of a fixed yearly level payable upon the completion of a given operational year would be highly desirable to NASA.   The NAICS Code for this requirement is 927110. NASA intends to award a single contract for a period of performance of 5 to 10 years. NASA is seeking interested companies with specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements.  NASA is requesting that interested firms submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) expressing their desire and ability to meet the Sabatier System for ISS (SSI) objectives.  Potential sources must submit a written SOC to the contact listed in this announcement.  The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing these areas:      (1) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house, research and development effort, relevant to the specific task areas of this effort; (2) Personnel: position description, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in areas of the subject effort; (3) Facilities: identification of specialized facilities and equipment which is owned or leased or is otherwise available as non-GFE to the respondent and might be utilized in support of this effort; and  (4) Financial: ability to meet financial commitments to support the development efforts required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. All submissions are limited to 25 pages.  Additional reference material beyond the page limit or links to web sites will not be accepted. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  All responses shall be submitted to Amanda J. Kreusch, Contract Specialist at amanda.j.kreusch@nasa.gov no later than January 19, 2007 and should reference the Sabatier Sources Sought Notice.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTES. Information gathered in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to support the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JP EO-CBD) and the Joint Service Transportable Decontamination System (JSTDS) Program Office (PO) survey of both available and soon to be available products that have the capability to mix a solid granular decontaminant with water.  The JSTDS PO requests info rmation on mixing capabilities to support field mixing of Decontamination Formula (DF) 300.  DF 300, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, is comprised of three solid granular components that are mixed with water.  To date, DF 300 has only been mixed in a laboratory using a magnetic stirrer in the following manner: Part 1 (solubilizers) is ad ded to water and mixed vigorously (0.4 KW per cubic meter) until dissolved (one minute); Part 2 (peroxide) is added and mixed vigorously until dissolved (six minutes); and Part 3 (foam) is added and stirred gently until dissolved (four minutes).  Laborator y mixing has yielded one liter batches; large quantities will be required in the field.  An operational scenario to yield 100 gallons of decontaminant would require 320 pounds (7.2 cubic feet) of DF 300 be mixed with 70 gallons of water; the formulation wi ll then be dispensed via a military applicator system.  Further information on the concept of employment can be found in the MultiService Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures Field Manual (FM) 3-11.5. Specific product performance and support information is sought on items that are currently available or are actively being pursued by industry to be available in the 2007 timeframe. Information is requested on rugged systems that would withstand the harsh military environment (vibration, temperature, humidity, transport drops, blowing sand, etc.) or could be readily modified to withstand these environments.  This RFI is issued solely for information and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Vendors having products that they believe would be suita ble for military decontamination operations as described herein shall submit hard copies and/or an electronic copy of their product data sheets, related brochures, descriptions, price lists, or other documentation deemed appropriate.   No telephonic respon ses will be considered. Responses should include product name, product description, manufacturer, weight and cube, manpower requirements, cost per unit, formulations with which the system is compatible, length of time the product has been produced or when product is expected to b e available, current uses of the system, and a point of contact should the Government desire further information. Interested parties shall submit information to the following address by Ms Sandra Wood; Sandra.j.wood@usmc.mil; 50 Tech Parkway, Suite 301, Stafford, VA, 22556.

MARCORSYSCOM would like to identify the current availability of what industry is capable of producing and, equally, the limits of current technology.  This study is not limited to any type classified round or caliber. The study will be structured so that industry representatives will have two days of exhibition time per qualifying system (POH of 80% or greater beyond 1000 meters.) Day one will consist of system instruction and vendor live fire demonstration.  Instruction should be on weapons, optics, range finders, ballistic computers and programs, weather stations and/or what ever fire control equipment each particular vendor may have integrated into their system.  Vendor live fire will consist of firing on both paper and steel targets at known and unknown distances utilizing any ancillary equipment.  Day two will be for the government representatives to live fire each system utilizing any ancillary equipment. The Government will cover the cost of range rental. The range is Gunsite of Paulden, AZ.   Each vendor will be responsible for their own lodging and for transportation of their designated personnel, weapons, equipment and ammunition to and from the range.  Vendors are encouraged to bring whatever fire control equipment (i.e. laser range finders, ballistic computers, ballistic charts, weather stations, spotting scopes, etc.) they require.

<SUBJECT>R -- Facility Management and Engineering Program Development and Management Support Service (FM&E PDMSS)
<DESC>Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Facility Management and Engineering Program Development and Management Support Service (FM&E PDMSS) Program Multi-Step Process. 

CBP intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result in the award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This contract is to provide program development, implementation, and integration support services for the efficient and effective management of the CBP Facility Management and Engineering Center (FM&EC).  The focus of FM&E PDMSS Program is to provide program development, implementation, and integration support services for the efficient and effective management of the CBP FM&E Center environment.  These management and program development efforts direct the end-to-end program activities required to develop, execute, sustain, and dispose of real property and infrastructure portfolios.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.  Size Standard is $6.5M.  The Solicitation/RFP number has not yet been assigned.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this Special Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  This method also correlates with use of a Statement of Objectives for performance-based support under a single integration support contract.   Telephone request for this Special Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1 of the Advisory Multi-Step process, described below.   The anticipated solicitation (Phase 2) release date is mid-February 2007.  Please ensure the reference number and program title (U.S. Customs and Border Protection, FM&E PDMSS Program) is referenced on all correspondence.  

ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS: 
This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of (1) relevant contract performance data; (2) answers to questions reflected in the experience form submitted with this notice; (3) vendor capability statements, and (4) subsequent advisory notifications to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  To preserve the integrity of the on-going solicitation, the government will not entertain any phone call, emails, questions, or communications during this phase.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, proposal evaluation, and award.  

PHASE 1 ? SUBMISSION OF VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS, AGENCY EVALUATIONS AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATIONS.   

This phase includes submission of Vendor Capability Statements, FM&E PDMSS Program Relevant Experience Questionnaire, contract performance data, followed by CBPs assessment and the advisory notifications. 

A.  Submission of Vendor Capability Statements describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements and the accompanying Relevant Experience Questionnaire forms must be submitted via email to susan.hargett-evans@dhs.gov no later than Tuesday January 23, 2007 at 2:00pm EST.   Please ensure that U.S. Customs and Border Protection, FM&E PDMSS Program is referenced in the subject line of the email. 

Responding to a performance-based solicitation, especially one utilizing a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that seeks contractor-developed solutions requires a significant effort on the part of offeror.   It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the agency?s evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches and solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the agency?s intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solutions thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this performance-based contract award are asked to carefully review the attached program background, Capability Statements and Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability. 

B.  Agency Evaluations:  

The Vendor Capability Statements will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statements Instructions below.  The agency will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communication with the vendors who provide submissions.   There will be no opportunity for questions during this phase.   

C.  Advisory Notifications: 
CPB will issue advisory notifications stating that the respondents will either be invited to participate in the resulting acquisition, or based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.   As explained in FAR 15.202(b) Advisory Multi-Step process, the agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition. 

PHASE 2 - SOLICITATION, PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND AWARD OF AN IDIQ CONTRACT 

This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed technical and cost proposals, management plans, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify tasks to be completed by the successful offeror following contract award.   To ensure the government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors will be provided an opportunity to participate in a due diligence session where prospective offerors meet with key agency representatives to learn about the FM&E PDMSS Program, mission goals, and requirements in order to develop a competitive solution. 

VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS AND RELEVANT EXPERIENCE FORM

CBP expects capability statements from qualified prime contractors.   The capabilities of any potential sub-contractor(s) or partner(s) may be incorporated into a single capability statement.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in the notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on Solicitation Number: 2007-Q-09279.  The solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Action Circular 2005-14, dated November 22, 2006.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Acquisitions of Commercial Items and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541380, and the small business size is eleven million dollars.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has a requirement for a MD or PHD primary investigator to provide all labor, materials and equipment required to complete tasks outlined below.       

1.	The laboratory must specialize in the microbiological assay of folate, and has built up an international reputation in this respect, with a sample throughput that is compatible with carrying out large population based studies such as NHANES. 

2.	The laboratory must have at least 20 years of experience with the assay as evidenced by peer reviewed publications in the scientific literature using the microbiological assay for folate.

3.	The laboratory must have published in the peer reviewed literature the conditions of the assay.


4.	The laboratory should have been established at least thirty years and recognized internationally as a center of high repute in the area of folate.

5.	The laboratory should be a pioneer in the development and application of new techniques in the analysis of folates and folate related metabolites including HPLC methods, amino acid analysis, radioisotope methods, microbiological assays and cell culture technology. 

6.	RBC folate must be measured using a modification of the traditional microbiological method using Lactobacillus casei with several important technological advances that have made it more robust and allowed it to be automated, thus ensuring a reliable, easily maintained and high throughput assay system.

7.	Serum folate must be measured using a modification of the traditional microbiological method using Lactobacillus casei with several important technological advances that have made it more robust and allowed it to be automated, thus ensuring a reliable, easily maintained and high throughput assay system.

8.	The microbiological assays should include the use of a specific chloramphenicol resistant strain of L. casei, which has recently been renamed and catalogued Lactobacillus rhamnosus [ATCC 27773; NCIB 10463], and the use of glycerol protected cryopreserved aliquots of inoculums. These adaptations will ensure ongoing standardized growth curves that are reproducible for hundreds of assays. 

9.	The assay must be validated within a range of standard folic acid amounts from 0.025 to 0.5 ng/mL (0.06 to 1.13 nM) using a 4-parameter logistic curve fitting program.

10.	The assay must be highly sensitive and requires samples to be diluted from between 1/40 and 1/640


11.	The laboratory must utilize robotic liquid handling equipment, thus affording large sample throughput with lower risk of contamination or sample mix-up and better monitoring of quality control. 


12.	Folic acid should be routinely used as the calibration standard and growth must demonstrate to be equivalent to growth using the natural folate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate

13.	The volume of samples, required to be processed with results available to NCHS within 3 weeks of receipt of specimens, require a high throughput.

14.	Test results and quality control results must be supplied in machine-readable format no later than three weeks (3) after receipt of serum/whole specimens.  

15.	The Laboratory must have a well-established quality assurance program.

16.	Data should be transmitted to NHANES in electronic data files in a format stipulated by NHANES.  

17.	Submit results and QC files electronically to the NHANES survey contractor on a flow basis.  The delivery date is on a flow basis three (3) weeks after the specimens are received.  

18.	Labs should maintain historical records/archives of transmissions and results to support resolution of questions or issues regarding particular samples throughout the course of the study.

19.	For quality control assessment the laboratory should provide quality control rules for RBC folate and serum folate.

20.	Provide list of possible comment codes associated with the laboratory results that might be required.

21.	Maintain an adequate storage facility (-70 degrees C for sera) for specimens upon receipt and for any excess sera specimen remaining in vials after analyzing the samples.

22.	Accept delivery of specimens on a predetermined schedule supplied by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/Westat.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
   
 (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LOW CYCLE FATIGUE TESTS.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions as follows: Q.)  Can you give a rough idea of schedule, i.e. when would the first samples be made available for testing?	A.)  All specimens could be shipped for testing in the next 2 months.  Q.)  Will NASA provide the specimens for testing? A.)	Yes.  Q.)  What heat treatment is required and who will do it?  A.)	None required.	Q.)If we are to do the HT do you want it done on finished specimens or on specimen blanks?  A.)  None required.  Q.)  Two drawings are specified. Does the vendor have a choice as to which to employ, or are different ones to be used for different tests?  A.)  No. Q.)  If the customer is to provide specimens why have two drawing been provided?  A.)  NASA will send specimens of either of the two drawings.  Q.)  Is this primarily a program to develop S-N (or Strain-N) data or are you interested in endurance limits or in the statistical distribution of the results?  A.)  Need the elastic modulus, maximum, minimum, elastic, plastic, total strains; maximum, minimum stresses at the start and at half life, as well as initiation and separation lives.  NASA will want a runout life, to stop tests still going.	Q.)  Should the extensometers be diametral (i.e. monitor radial strain) or longitudinal (over a gage length?) A.)	Longitudinal.  Q.)  No test matrix was specified. Does the vendor have the choice of the distribution of specimens between temperatures and Strain/stress ranges or will the customer specify it?  A.)  NASA will specify, so a., b., c. below wont apply. a.	Are you more interested in data from many temperatures or for more strains at each temperature? b.	Do you want duplicate tests run and if so how many for each group? c.	Should we specify a preliminary matrix based on the answers to questions 5, 6a and 6b?  Q.)  Has any provision been made to insure that when switching from 0.5 Hz in strain control to 10Hz in load control (for the same load range), that the hysteresis loop width is not significantly decreased?  A.)  Just need to match maximum and minimum stresses generated at the end of the 0.5 Hz strain control test interval.  Q.)	If an asymmetric hysteresis loop develops in the stabilized strain controlled loops (different tensile and compressive maximum stresses), should the vendor use these asymmetric stresses for the load controlled testing?  A.)	Yes.  Q.)  Periodic hysteresis loops are requested. When the specimens have shifted to load control at 10Hz, does the customer want the cycling to be stopped periodically and then 0.5Hz hysteresis loops drawn using load control, with the same load range as was being used in the 10 Hz tests. Alternatively, it might be possible to use an oscilloscope to get 10Hz hysteresis loops.  A.)  No need for loops during load control 10 Hz testing.  Q.)	70 tests were specified. To do 70 successful tests will require more than 70 specimens as some tests will experience machine failures and the results from these tests will not be invalid. Will more than 70 specimens be supplied and if not what provisions will be made for make-up tests?	A.)  NASA has reserve spares.  Q.)  Some tests are to be interrupted prior to failure. Who will decide which tests are to be interrupted?  A.)  NASA will specify.  Q.)  The low strain (long life) tests are to be run under load control. What about the tests run at higher strains, where failure occurs in a reasonable time at 0.5Hz? Do you also want these tests to be switched to load control? If not some tests will be run under strain control and some under load control. However, switching higher strain tests presents problems, as it is more likely that the strain at 10 Hz will be different from that at 0.5Hz.	A.)  NASA will run 0.5 Hz strain control tests for 24 hours, then switch to load control with the extensometer removed if they have not failed at that point.  A.)  As in any test programs, there may be some specimens which yield incomplete data (e.g. test interruption due to power failure, testing failures), will they be part of the data package provided to and paid for by NASA?  A.)	Send any data generated and specimen from ruined test, but will test replacement specimen at no additional cost.	Q.)  Prior to start of testing, will there be a discussion between the contractor and the NASA project leaders on the overall test program, its objectives, the test matrix and test plan so that all parties understand what is expected?  A.)  Yes. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 1/15/2007. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
