URI has held curatorial responsibility for the NARWSD since the mid 1980's. The Graduate School of Oceanography, URI provides a staff of highly trained personnel. These individuals must have considerable experience with Right whales in the field, as well as with associated data analysis. Auditing and formatting new sightings of Right whales cannot be adequately undertaken without extensive knowledge of surveys and right whale biology. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(3), Industrial mobilization; or engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center.
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 541712. The Federal Supply Code, (FSC) is F020.</p>
<p>The planned period of performance is: September 1, 2011 through August 31, 2013.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all proposals received by August 29, 10:00 A.M. EST shall be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the requirement. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR, visit the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.</p>

<SOLNBR>12-233-SOL-00011
<CONTACT>James J. Horkan, Phone 3014431658, Email james.horkan@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The proposed acquisition listed herein is a section 8(a) competitive set-aside. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of HHS for onsite support and panel review. The RFP number is 12-233-SOL-00011. The NAICS code is 541611. The size standard is $7.0M.
<p><br />ANA promotes self-sufficiency for Native Americans by providing funding and training and technical assistance to eligible tribes and native organizations to develop, implement, and administer their own community-based projects. The concept of promoting self-sufficiency is based on the following core beliefs:</p>
<p>&bull; The native community is self-sufficient when it can generate and control the resources necessary to meets its social and economic goals and the needs of its members.<br />&bull; The responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency resides within the native governing bodies and local leadership.<br />&bull; Progress toward self-sufficiency is based on efforts to plan and direct resources in a comprehensive manner consistent with long-range goals.</p>
<p>Section 803 of the Native American Programs Act (NAPA) of 1974, P.L. 93-644, as amended (hereinafter "the Act"), identifies the programs that ANA funds while Section 804 authorizes training and technical assistance to potential applicants and grantees. Other supporting statutes are the Native American Languages Act (Public Law 102-524) and the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act (Public Law 101-408).</p>
<p>In carrying out Section 803 of the Act, ANA administers the following competitive, discretionary project grant programs: (1) Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS); (2) Environmental Regulatory Enhancement; and (3) Native Language Preservation and Maintenance. The demand is highest for ANA grants in the SEDS program.</p>
<p>Each year, ANA convenes review sessions to rank and score eligible grant applications. ANA recruits professionals who possess experience and qualifications relevant to ANA program areas to serve as panel reviewers and facilitators. Panel reviewers analyze, score and comment on ANA grant applications. Panel facilitators work with a team of three panel reviewers to facilitate discussion and consolidate comments.</p>
<p>In response to Section 804 of the Act, ANA specifically provides training and technical assistance; coordinates annual panel review sessions; conducts annual project impact evaluations on its grantees; and directly administers community-based projects and several private-public partnerships. Typically, ANA administers approximately 240 projects a year. ANA's constituency resides in reservation, village, island and urban communities.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to provide onsite support to ANA with grant application processing, panel review planning and logistics and other related activities. The onsite providers must be knowledgeable about ANA's mission, goals, and funding priorities, as well as HHS and ACF initiatives and issues of importance to organizations and entities eligible for ANA funding. The Contractor must have an understanding of the federal grant management and administration processes and associated OMB and HHS policies, regulations, and statutes.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be a 6 month base period followed by 4 optional 12 month periods.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All responsible 8(a) concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br> <br>U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Transcranial Doppler Program<br>Transcranial Doppler Services for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury<br><br>This a  SOURCES SOUGHT announcement issued by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the U.S. Army Surgeon General's Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Program which is managed by the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) at Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The purpose of this annoucement is to conduct Market Research in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001(a)(2) for the acquisition of TCD services.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  In order to protect the integrity of any future procurement, if any should arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br><br>The NAICS code for the project is 621999.<br><br>The small business size standard is $9,000,000.00<br><br>Background/Purpose:<br><br>The TCD Program is part of the U.S. Army Surgeon General's overall Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Action Plan. It was developed to address the need for timely assessment of cerebral vascular injuries such as vasospasm from TBI. The AMEDD TCD Program uses a comprehensive approach to assessing and monitoring cerebral vascular activities utilizing a central laboratory for oversight and management of this important medical capability.  This program, managed by the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), has implemented an enhanced level of support for clinicians by providing rapid response to TBI through transcranial ultrasound testing and interpretation. It has served as a vital component of the Neuro-Critical Care Service for the National Capitol Neurosurgery Consortium-which includes Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) - herein referred to as Walter Reed National Medical Center (WRNMC), as well as Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) and Wilford Hall Medical Center - herein referred to as San Antonio Military Medical Centers (SAMMC), representing a tri-service approach and providing a capability to areas that previously did not exist. Given the need for early detection, the program will be expanded to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) near Kaiserslautern, Germany, bringing a capacity for early detection closer to the point of injury.  <br><br>The TCD Program will ensure a comprehensive approach to TCD services by implementing a Central Laboratory for oversight and management of this important medical capability. In addition to the traditional TCD testing and interpretations for WRNMC and SAMMC, this program will implement an enhanced level of support for clinicians at LRMC.<br>  <br>Objective:<br><br>The TCD Program will ensure that physicians at WRNMC, SAMMC, and LRMC will have access to a comprehensive TCD service to ensure the highest standard of neurological care for wounded warriors suffering from brain injury.

A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a request for quote (Reference-Number F2XTB91178A001). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-53 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DPN) 20110725. It is the contractor's responsibility to become familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.<br />A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following the Schedule of Supplies:<br />NAICS Code: 337127; size standard: 500 employees<br />The Defense Priorities and Allocations System rating is C9E.<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT IS SOLICITING FOR "OPEN MARKET" QUOTES ONLY. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (GSA) QUOTES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. <br />NATURE OF ACQUISITION:<br />Maxwell Air Force Base has a requirement to purchase the below listed industrial furniture. The Schedule of Supplies/Services provides all items, details and quantities required. This procurement will be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br />SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:<br />This acquisition is for the purchase of the following items:
<p>CLIN 0001: Table, Asset Advanced Support/Survival Equipment Table, P/N: AST-35 (OR EQUAL)</p>
<p>Quoted tables must also include the following essential Characteristics:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENT (SOR) : Parachute packing table for mobility <br />5 July 11</p>
<p>Technical Order 14D3-11-1 details a packing table for parachute inspections should be long enough to lay out the complete parachute assembly for inspection and servicing (45 feet by 36 inches by 36 inches) and that it should be smooth and free of slivers and burrs. The Unit Type Code for my unit requires 6 packing tables in MIL-T-43150. These tables will not fit in an ISU-90 for shipping which makes them not protectable in severe weather. We built our mobility package during in climate weather and due to limit protection of these assets they warp badly making them unserviceable for an inspection area for future deployments.<br />The tables shall connect from end to end to conform to flat inspection area while being lightweight for mobility. These tables are deployable in all standard mobility containers ISU-90 and light weight which aids in packing them for mobility as well as setting up a shop. The table top surfaces shall be easily replaced without tools should they become damaged. Tables shall incorporate materials that will not rust, corrode or deteriorate. The low profile, compact and rugged transformable platforms with interlocking ability provides stability and strength for packing parachutes. The folding legs with casters aids in the packing process for storage with an ISU-90 so that the cumbersome of long tables would take up more room in the ISU-90 and is hard to handle during various deployments set-up configurations. These tables shall be light weight and manageable within an ISU-90 to allow for packing additional equipment to meet the unit type codes. Now with legs extended and castors wheels in place the parachute table stands 36"tall, 36" wide and 60" long which when connected together to meet the length of a parachute canopy laid out for repacking. The wheels aids in the movement within a certain area if needed during mobility set-ups at forward locations to aid in the movement and lifting heavy tables during set-up.</p>

<p>FAR 52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010)<br />(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.209-7 - Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

<p>(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).</p>
<p>(b) The offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions:</p>
<p>(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.</p>
<p>(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.</p>
<p>(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-</p>
<p>(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or</p>
<p>(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.</p>
