<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source ContractTactical Air Control Party (TACP) Close Air Support System (CASS) Software (v) 1.4.4 and CASS Support
This is a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.  The Department of the Air Force, HQ ESC/HNAC, Ground Systems Branch, TACP Modernization, plans to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/ Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract to Rockwell Collins Inc, 12365 First American Way, Poway CA 92064 for continuing the design, development, training and support services for TACP CASS (v) 1.4.4, and sustainment services to support fielded TACP CASS Software.  The support services necessary include providing maintenance patches, training, support for military exercises, and 24 hour technical support for fielded CASS software versions. 
TACP CASS (v) 1.4.4 is currently in development but will not be completed under the existing Navy Delivery Order Contract.  The government intends to award a sole source contract in Apr 2011 for continued design and development of CASS Version (v) 1.4.4 Software, and the support effort for currently fielded CASS versions. This contracting action will be used to "bridge" current requirements with future CASS version software development and sustainment, and has an estimated value of less than $10 Million. The follow on effort is planned to be solicited to Industry at a later date for future software version development and fielding. Upon award of the "bridge" contract, the contractor will be expected to maintain current schedule which requires the start of Operational Test in August 2011 and fielding in April 2012.  CASS Software (v) 1.4.4 provides critical enhancements that can be used to communicate with various types of platforms over various networks.  TACP units communic! ate with other ground units and with aircraft via direct radio contact using Variable Message Format (VMF), Air Force Application Program Development (AFAPD), or Marine Tactical Standard (MTS) and via the Link-16 network or the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) network.

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />*****</p>

<DESC>As required by FAR 5.201, the Governments intends to award a sole sourcecontract to Vertu Corp. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, which states thatonly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfyagency requirements. Effective competition is not anticipated for thisacquisition by virtue of the only known source with access to the TDP is Vertu Corp. The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ., has a requirement for 19,509 M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun Systems.  The Government plans to solicit (FY-11-FY15) requirement Sole Source to Vertu Corp. doing business as C- More Systems, 655 Industrial Road, Warrenton, VA,20186.  This is a follow-on to contract W15QKN-05-C-0456 which was competitively awarded to Vertu Corp. Only one responsible source is deemed suitable for this procurement because the proposed contractor,Vertu Corp, has developed and owns the data rights for the shotgunstechnical data package (TDP) and the Government does not have a TDPavailable for competition, at this time. The M26 (MASS) has gonethrough qualification testing and is currently being produced by Vertu Corp.the owner of the technical data package, under the LRIP contract. After a threshold production rate of 500 units per month is reached at the end of theLRIP contract, PEO SOLDIER is expected to authorize Full Material Release and Full Rate Production of the M26. The M26 MASS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), approved on 28 June 2004 requires a standardized accessory shotgun capability to execute multiple missions.The M26 is highly unique in that it will permit the Soldier to conduct door breaching operations while maintaining primary weapon control, allow shotshell employment while maintaining primary weapon control/employability,and enable increased Soldier mobility over the current systems. This new contract will ensure that the M26 (National Stock Number 1005-01-535-3487) seamlessly transitions from the current Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to Full-Rate Production (FRP) contract. Point of contact for thisaction is Contract Specialist robert.phelan1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA., 94404 for the below item.

The reference number: NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2011-006-DDC. 

Part #4337457, TF, BDT v3.1 RR-5000 & SEQ BUFFER, quantity 1 each 
   
The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Hematology Branch conducts research on the genetic basis of bone marrow failure diseases, acute leukemias and hepatic cirrhosis. The basic approach is the performance of genetic sequencing of multiple genes involved in telomere erosion and repair in blood samples of thousands of patients with acquired aplastic anemia and other syndromes per year.  The laboratory has a 3130 ABI automatic sequencer. The ABI Big Dye Terminator kit is the dedicated and essential reagent to run the sequencing. Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase the item from the manufacturer. If not this could cause a delay in the project as well as jeopardize the project by procuring this from another source. Competition for the ABI Big Dye Terminator is not required.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Building 10-CRC Room 3-5232, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does not apply to this requirement.

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition 
procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-45 (October 1, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by October 29, 2010, 7:30am Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2011-006-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Deborah Coulter.  Response may be submitted electronically to coulterd@nhlbi.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /><br />This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research for an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) able to support the detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Submission of any information in response to this RFI is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY, and SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A FEE to the government.</p>
<p>Description of Need: To increase the mobility of future military units, more technologically efficient multi-capable tools must be developed.</p>
<p>Current Situation: US Forces are encountering large numbers of hostile forces in both urban and non urban settings. US forces currently use a variety of robotic platforms for reconnaissance and surveillance. These platforms are slow getting down range and the height at which mounted cameras can observe suspect items is limited. The use of an UAS would decrease time on target, eliminate exposing personnel to hazards and enhance reconnaissance capabilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Electronics Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, MA seeks a UAS with the following technical capabilities:</p>
<p>a. Portable Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) (less than 150lbs including fuel and battery and able to be carried by a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle).</p>
<p>b. Rugged and reliable, able to withstand daily usage operating in harsh environments (hot, cold, humid, dusty, sand, maritime, shock, etc.).</p>
<p>c. Radio frequency remote controlled capable (2km range minimum) and interoperable with current fielded systems (i.e. passive early detection systems, Vehicle Optic Sensor System, electronic countermeasures, Counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW), etc.)</p>
<p>d. Low light and Infrared (IR) camera capable to view/observe suspect devices. The Electro Optical (EO) camera must have a Wide Field Of View (WFOV) Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 0.2m (Threshold)/0.1m (Objective) and Narrow Field Of View (NFOV) GSD of 0.025m (Threshold)/ 0.01m (Objective) while maintaining a wide-area field of view of 500ft on either side of a road at horizontal image center (Threshold)/900ft on either side of a road at horizontal image center (Objective) from 1,000ft Above Ground Level (AGL) at 30 degree slant angle. The IR camera must have a WFOV GSD of 0.35m (Threshold)/0.1m (Objective) and NFOV GSD of 0.05m (Objective) while maintaining a wide-area field of view of 500ft on either side of a road at horizontal image center (Threshold)/900ft on either side of a road at horizontal image center (Objective) from 1,000ft AGL at 30 degree slant angle.<br /><br />e. One person operator control unit with video/controls clearly visible in direct sun without any washout or glare.</p>
<p>f. Flight Endurance: 3 hours (Threshold)/8 hours (Objective).</p>
<p>g. The platform should be able to be monitored and controlled through a mobile control station and no special military operational skill should be necessary to control the platform operations.</p>
<p>h. Video feed real time to the operator on target, with real time link capability back to Tactical Operation Center (TOC).</p>
<p>i. Capable of carrying a payload: 20 pounds (Threshold)/50 pounds (Objective).</p>
<p>j. Semi autonomous flight, landing and takeoff utilizing Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>
<p>k. The system will be capable of being operated at ranges of a minimum altitude of 200ft AGL and a maximum altitude of 12,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).</p>
<p>l. The system will be capable of maneuvering at speeds from hover to a forward speed of 50kts.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capabilities package in response to this RFI. Capabilities packages should describe your capability to provide the UAS with the technical thresholds described above. Additionally, capabilities packages should describe if the UAS is a mature technology (e.g., has it been fielded/sold in the past, is it developmental, etc.), provide information on any similarly awarded contracts, and provide company information (address, point of contact, etc.). Responses to this RFI are due no later than 1500 Eastern Time on 5 Nov 2010. Responses are requested not to exceed ten (10) pages. Please submit responses to Harvey Tobin at harvey.tobin@hanscom.af.mil. Please direct any questions about this RFI to Harvey Tobin at (781) 377-5425.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Reflood thermal-hydraulics represents an important set of phenomena during a hypothetical loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA). These phenomena must be accurately simulated by systems codes in determining plant response to a LOCA. The NRC is currently assessing and improving the TRAC/RELAP Computational Engine (TRACE) code for best estimate analysis of light water reactors. While calculation of reflood by TRACE appears to be reasonable, higher accuracy is needed. Accurate prediction of the consequences of a LOCA is important because it is one of the postulated accident scenarios that determine the licensed core power and several other operational parameters.</p>
<p>As a result, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) conducts experimental investigations of reflood thermal-hydraulics in order to provide data for model development and to validate its systems codes. The NRC sponsored the design and construction of a Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) Test Facility (Ref. NUREG/CR-6976 ML093640771), this RBHT Test Facility is designed to conduct systematic separate effects tests under well-controlled laboratory conditions in order to generate fundamental rod bundle heat transfer data from single phase cooling tests, low flow boiling tests, steam flow tests with and without droplet injection, inverted annular film boiling tests, and dispersed flow film boiling heat transfer tests in rod bundles. The facility is capable of operating in steady state forced and variable reflood modes covering a wide range of flow and heat transfer conditions at pressures from 0.134 to 0.402 MPa (20 to 60 psia). <br />Capability Sought</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in performing experimental measurements in a controlled laboratory environment simulating the reflood scenario after a postulated LOCA of a nuclear reactor. The facility shall be capable to test the heater rods at full core height to a temperature of 2200 Deg F, and capable to provide steady-state and various mass flow rate for a system pressure from 20 to 60 psia.</p>
<p>Specific capabilities of the test facility shall include: 1) a heater rod bundle of full height similar to a full height bundle in a reactor core with configuration similar to a portion of a typical pressurized water reactor (PWR) 17x17 fuel assembly with spacer grids; 2) instrumentation to provide detailed rod surface and spacer grid temperature in axial and lateral distribution; 3) instrumentation that provides test loop pressure and mass flow rate measurements; 4) a steam and water injection system that create pure steam flow or any droplet flow condition under reflood conditions; 5) sensors for steam and water temperature measurement; 6) instruments that can provide droplet size and velocity measurement at various elevations in the test section and void information; 7) data acquisition system that has at least 500 channels for data sampling and 10HZ data rate; 8) have a scaling analysis and QA plan ready on the test equipment; 9) have a QA plan for data acquisition methodology and plan for submitting data in NRC specified format; 10) Qualify test data and benchmark of new test results with existing cases; and 11) support of Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) presentations. RES requires contractor support to augment the available staff resources and provide access to experts with competencies, accrued knowledge, and highly specialized skills in the areas of, but not limited to: nuclear engineering, two-phase flow, heat transfer, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. RES requires qualified technical specialists with extensive expertise in the technical areas described.</p>
<p>The contractors should be technical experts in their field, with extensive research experience and active participation in cognizant nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulic committees. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge in their technical area in order to identify and resolve issues. The contractors should also be technically creditable to respond to technical questions during ACRS presentations based on their in-depth knowledge resulting from their education, research experience, and code committee activities.</p>
<p>Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements please address the market research questions below and provide capability information on your staff's qualifications and your firm's corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts. In addition, to provide an overview of your company's capabilities please complete the attached spreadsheet for those technical areas for which your firm has expertise. When completing the spreadsheets, please provide specific entries for potentially available qualified candidates. In each of the technical areas of expertise and education, if it applies, enter the candidates' relevant years of work experience, research experience, national code committee (IEEE, ASME, ASTM, etc...) experience, code committee names, and degree title.</p>
<p>Market Research Questions</p>
<p>1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number</p>
<p>2) How long has your company been in operation?</p>
<p>3) What type of business is your company (i.e., small, 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, etc.)?</p>

<DESC><p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer<br />Personnel Accountability System</p>
<p>This exchange is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e) as a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of this RFI is for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to gain knowledge of all qualified and interested small and other than small business concerns with experience within the referenced requirement and is being issued solely for DHS' informational and planning purposes as it may relate to acquisition strategy, planning schedules, feasibility of the requirement, development of the requirement, etc. This exchange in no way represents a formal solicitation for proposals, quotations, or bids with the intent to form binding agreements based upon results. DHS may (or may not), at the agency's sole discretion, issue a formal solicitation for this requirement at a later time. Within that vein, any descriptive/requirements information provided by DHS in this exchange is subject to change and shall in no way be treated as final or binding. <br />1. Background: <br />The DHS Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) develops, implements, and evaluates Department-wide human capital policies and standards. OCHCO has primary responsibility for the human capital of DHS, including the disposition of the human capital resources of the organization for continuity of operation (COOP) purposes. In addition, OCHCO is responsible for implementing enterprise-wide human resources solutions.<br />2. Requirements:<br />DHS/OCHCO is seeking information regarding the capabilities and qualifications of a responsible and qualified firm to perform the requirements of this RFI.</p>
<p>DHS/OCHCO requires contractor support in developing and implementing the functional requirements for a DHS personnel accountability system that will provide a standardized method to account for and determine the status of DHS employees, detailees and contractor staff who may be affected by a catastrophic event or emergency situation. <br />The purpose of developing or procuring a personnel accountability system is to ensure that DHS leadership can, with little or no scheduling or advance direction, request an accountability of the DHS workforce, its status and well being, and availability to report to work. The capability would be essential in the event of a large-scale disaster, e.g., Hurricane Katrina, and also for a localized emergency as minor as a power outage in a specific DHS building. <br />On a departmental basis, at the moment, there is no standard methodology to collect accountability data, to assess in like terms the status of employees, or a template as to what information is required in any given situation. By resolving this challenge on a department-wide, enterprise basis, the result will be that Components are asking the same questions as to employee accountability and speaking the same language in reporting the data.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command along with the Army ContractingCommand Picatinny Contracting Center will be conducting a Reduced Optical Signature Emissions Solution (ROSES) Industry Day on 5-6 January 2011 from 0900 to 1530 hrs to be held at Bldg 12, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806.  The days will consist of a classified threat brief (nonforeign vendors), unclassified threat brief (foreign vendors), ROSES program specifications and requirements, industry capability brief, and responses to industrys questions. 
The definition of ROSES program for the purposes of this industry day is a solicitation program to develop, fabricate, inspect, test, and deliver a new spectrally matched low-visible Aircraft IR Countermeasure Flare.  The new flare will be designed to protect USSOCOM aircraft (and potentially other services) with little to no visible light output from advanced infrared guided missile threats. The effort will include a developmental phase; a small production quantity to verify performance, safety, and technical data will be part of this developmental program, with the eventual goal of full qualification for fielding and the possibility of a follow-on full rate production contract for a limited quantity of flares.
The first day of Industry Day (5 January 2011) will include classified briefings and presentations for nonforeign vendors.  The morning will consist of a classified overview of current and future threats and a ROSES program and requirements overview.  The afternoon will consist of scheduled 30 min briefings by each vendor to the US government, to include company overview, current flare efforts, and past and current flare development including low visibility and/or advanced flares.  The second day of Industry Day (6 January) will continue scheduled contractor briefs (as required), and will also have an unclassified session in the afternoon for foreign vendors regarding the threat brief and ROSES overview. 
Advanced registration for Industry Day is required. Registration must be submitted to Ms. Kristen Kachur by 1500 hrs on 15 December 2010.  Each company may register up to five (5) personnel to attend Industry Day.  Registration must be accomplished by sending a letter on company letterhead with the first and last name of each of the companys attendees (no more than five) to Ms. Kachur. Your signed letter may be sent to Ms. Kristen Kachur, ACC Contracting Center, ATTN: CCJM-ET, Bldg 322, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or submitted via email to kristen.kachur@us.army.mil. 
All respondents will be notified about their scheduled date and time for capability brief after 15 December 2010. Classified briefings will be classified to SECRET.  Clearance information shall be sent via JPAS, SMO Code: W6B3AA5, POC, Jane Smith (973-724-3280).  Additionally, foreign attendees shall submit formal request for visit notification through their embassy. It is reminded that foreign visit requests must be submitted 30 days prior to arrival (deadline: 4 December 2010).  All foreign attendees are required to provide their passport numbers with their visit request.
Questions will be accepted prior to Industry Day, due no later than 15 December 2010, and responses will be provided during the event. All questions submitted prior to Industry Day must be e-mailed to the Contract Specialist identified in this Federal Business Opportunities notification with the following subject line Questions - ROSES Industry Day.  Questions submitted via facsimile or telephone will not be accepted.  While attendees will also have the opportunity to submit questions during Industry Day, those questions will be answered as time permits.
This announcement should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Industry Day.  Should the U.S. Government have a future requirement to procure ROSES, a formal announcement will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  WARSTAR directorate, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Catherine Capone, 200 Red Acre Road, Stow, MA 01775.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR><BR>RESPONSES WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ONLY.<BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The contractor shall be performing tests to characterize the flammability properties of various materials in support of several programs. Primary responsibility will be to run the Pyrolysis Combustion Flow Calorimeter (PCFC) and the Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) Chamber; however, the contractor may be required to conduct other testing on the Thermal Barrier Test Apparatus (TBTA) or Vertical Flame Chamber depending on demand and priorities determined by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Ms, Catherine Capone is uniquely qualified to conduct the proposed work. She has been responsible for all testing conducted to date on the PCFC which Natick acquired in 2007. She has worked with the mfg representatives both in England and the US as well as the FAA (Inventors) to develop techniques and procedures to determine the flammability characteristics of materials using this highly specialized piece of equipment. Natick is one of the few laboratories able to conduct this testing. The PCFC (also referred to as the Microscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC)) Is a state-of the-art piece of equipment used to analyze the combustion properties of a material on a milligram scale, This technology, which was previously unavailable, is being correlated to larger scale equipment which has been available for years and has proven to be an accurate tool for predicting the response of materials In a larger scale scenario, Ms, Capone's has a master's degree in chemistry from Leigh and was a former chemistry teacher which contributes to analyzing<BR>the data generated from the PCFC and reporting the data In a format that is easily understood by project officers,<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>No formal market research was conducted, as Ms. Capone has worked on previous NSRDEC contracts. She worked summers from 1989 -1995 while a school teacher and then came back in 2005 after retiring to work on the flow calorimeter, particle analyzer and more recently the PCFC. She has been an author/coauthor on several papers and reports while here at NSRDEC.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>This research is required to support on-going NSRDEC projects in flame resistant technologies. Highly qualified contractor support is required In order to meet program milestones. The Government currently does not have the in-house capability to perform these specialized tests.<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>This Government Is assessing in-house capabilities and anticipates bringing this specialized expertise on site in the future.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: jeff.bernard@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 Noon (EST) on October 31, 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SY, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Jeffrey Bernard, Contract Specialist (508)-233-6105<BR>Jeff.bernard@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE<BR>Contract No. W912DR-09-C-0026<BR><BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, intends to award a sole source modification to contract W912DR-09-C-0026 with Manhattan Torcon, JV. The purpose of this action is to modify the construction contract for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Ft. Detrick, MD project, authorizing the contractor to procure, deliver and install all firm fixed price Furnishings, Fixtures and Equipment (FF&E) included in the FF&E package as designed by CUH2A for this facility.  Manhattan Torcon JV shall provide all necessary materials, equipment, labor, supervision and management to (1) procure and deliver products; (2) install furniture in designated rooms and areas; and, (3) properly dispose of all associated packaging/crating materials.<BR><BR>Furniture items specified in the FF&E package have been selected as a basis for design only.   Manhattan Torcon will be required to gather a minimum of three (3) competitive quotes based on the FF&E package furnishings and shall procure the total package that is deemed the Best Value for the US Government.   The offerors will be evaluated on Price, Past Performance, Warranty Service, Trade-In, Special Features, Durability, Life Cycle Costs, Maintenance Availability, Environmental Factors and Energy Efficiency, Delivery Terms and Schedule.<BR><BR>Manhattan Torcon JV is uniquely positioned to execute the procurement and installation of the FF&E package designed for USAMRIID.  The JV will already be on-site, thereby able to utilize resources such as trailers, storage containers, equipment and vehicles as needed.  The JVs personnel have obtained the proper security clearances, and will have familiarity with the physical plant, as well as the various construction schedules and phasing issues. The JV will be responsible for project management and oversight of the FF&E package procurement and installation, thus eliminating the cost/need for a third party project management team and freeing up key Government personnel from performing this function. Manhattan Torcon JV will produce a turnkey deliverable to the Government, in that both facility and furnishings package are satisfactorily installed and complete. <BR><BR>Products selected for inclusion in the FF&E package were deemed functionally appropriate, able to perform at the highest level and qualified for use in the USAMRIID replacement facility. During the design process, all products were evaluated on technical, safety and environmental factors for acceptance into the laboratory/research environment.<BR><BR>This is not a formal solicitation or a request for quotation or proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. The government has determined, based on FAR 6.302- 1(a)(2)(iii), that services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. If no requests are received by 4:00 pm eastern time on November 1, 2010, the government reserves the right to execute a modification to the existing contract with Manhattan Torcon JV without publishing a solicitation.  The JV will request the quotations for this requirement.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed award based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to gary.faykes@usace.army.mil no later than the time and date noted above. Any capabilities statement received will be forwarded to the prime contractor for consideration.  <BR><BR>Products included (but not all inclusive) in the FF&E package are as follows:<BR><BR>Artwork display system with fasteners and cabling; A-V and Utility carts; General use carts for clinical areas; Mobile wire carts; Wire Cart Storage unit; Waste/recycle stations; Various waste receptacles; Technology Lecterns; Presentation carts for Conference Room; Coat trees; Step stools; Display shelf/carts; Battery operated Wall clocks; Freestanding Portable Screens; Metal arm guest/side chairs with mesh back  includes chair dollies; Laboratory stools (armless); Laboratory stools (low stool); Physician stools; Lounge chairs on steel pedestal base; Fully adjustable ergonomic task chairs on pedestal base; Metal task chair on pedestal base; Metal stacking arm guest/side chairs with mesh seat and casters; Armless lounge chairs with metal legs; Conference chairs with arms on pedestal base; Executive task chairs on pedestal base; Executive guest chairs with arms on sled base; High armless caf stools; Therapeutic Recliners; Locking Vertical Filing/Storage Cabinets; Locking Lateral Filing/Storage Cabinets; Bookcases; Patient Records Shelving System; Mail Sorter Furniture; Locking Storage Cabinets; Dining Tables; General Use Work Tables (Square, Round, Rectangle); Occasional Tables; Multi-purpose tables for conferencing & training; Nesting tables for training spaces; Linen inspection table; Conference Tables (various sizes & configurations); Systems Product Workstations (Tile & Frame)  various sizes and configurations Systems Product Workstations (Panel configuration)  various sizes and configurations Modular Wood Casegoods for Executive offices (includes desks, credenzas & wall units).<BR><BR>*****   End ****<BR><BR><BR>

<p style="BACKGROUND: white; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">6. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Determination That Costs Will Be Fair &amp; Reasonable: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contractor's proposed prices shall be prices that are offered on their Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) contract, which has already been competed and is considered to be fair and reasonable.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">7. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Description Of The Market Research Conducted: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Right of way agreements, past performance history of various wireless providers, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and on the ground usage makes it clear that Sprint provides the widest and most reliable cellular coverage in the NSWCEN. </span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">8. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Other Facts Supporting Other Than Full &amp; Open Competition: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>a. Reason why documents suitable for full &amp; open competition have not been developed: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>NSWCEN will consider competition with other service providers' cell phones when other service providers have equal or better representation; b. Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contractor's prices will be compared to the prices paid for similar services in the past. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contractor's prices will also be verified to be what is provided on their FISC Contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>c. The number of man-hours that would be needed to convert from the current command-issued Sprint cell phones to another wireless service would be an unreasonable burden to the command.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">9. Interested Sources: Sprint has territorial coverage areas and we are required to use this contractor in our area.</span></p>

Actions To Remove Barriers To Competition In The Future For Similar Acquisitions: NSWCEN will continue to look for other available sources and advertise NSWCEN's needs to initiate interest for firms to develop. </span></p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>TAB/FACTOR 8: PAST PERFORMANCE <br /><br />Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance, and that of significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, under existing or prior contracts for services. Past performance information will be used in making responsibility determination and to assess the capabilities of the offeror's in order to assure the selection of the proposal offering the greatest value to the Government. The Government will direct its inquiry to the past performance of the offeror, and its proposed significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, as such performance relates to the solicitation requirements. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates the quality of performance relative to the size, content, and complexity of the requirements. In particular, information on the following areas of contract performance will be collected and evaluated:</p>
<p>1) Conformance to specifications and standards of good workmanship.</p>
<p>2) Adherence to contract schedules</p>
<p>3) Compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract</p>
<p>4) General business conduct and business-like concern for the customer</p>

While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing relevant references that the Government can readily contact rests with the offeror.</p>
<p>Volume II: The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume II) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in 1. Pricing of the Solicitation and their proposed dollar amounts. The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred. The Offeror shall insert prices for all line items in 1. Pricing for the base year and for each option year.</p>
<p>FACTOR 9: PRICE</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.<br />Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractor's technical proposal.<br />Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions. Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates awarding one (1) IDIQ contract under this RFP to the responsive and responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements of the RFP and whose offer is considered to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offeror.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposals based upon technical factors and significant sub-factors described below</p>
<p>Factor 1 Top Secret Security Requirement<br />Factor 2 - Comparable Experience <br />Factor 3 - Technical Solution (custodial and snow removal plan of operation)<br />Sub-factor 2-A: Comparable experience in the performance of custodial services for similar size facilities. Each of the 2 contracts shall have, as a minimum, 500,000 sq ft of accumulative square footage of occupiable office cleaning space. Separate facilities may be combined within each contract in order to meet this cleaning requirement. <br />Sub 2-B: Comparable experience in the performance of custodial services for similar # of facilities. Each of the 2 contracts shall have, as a minimum, 3 or more buildings which received the cleaning of occupiable office space.<br />Factor 4 - Transition (Phase In/ Phase Out)<br />Factor 5 - Management Structure and Key Personnel Responsibilities (Resumes)<br />Factor 6 - Quality Control Plan<br />Factor 7 - Safety and Environmental Program and Requirements<br />Factor 8 - Past Performance <br />Factor 9 - Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Offerors' proposal shall meet the objectives outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and<br />provide the best value solution to the Government will be selected for award. The best value is defined<br />as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest<br />overall benefit in response to the stated objective.<br /><br />The Government may conduct a price realism evaluation in order to determine if the overall price<br />proposed is:<br />(1) Realistic for the work to be performed;<br />(2) Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements; and<br />(3) Are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>(a) The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine whether it meets the requirements described in<br />the solicitation. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's capability and approach to meet the<br />Government's objectives against the evaluation factors outlined in 52.212-2.</p>
<p>(b) A cost and/or price analysis shall be conducted based upon the data submitted by the Offeror in order<br />to determine that the negotiated cost or price to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, with the<br />exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each<br />Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally<br />rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Unacceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest<br />possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance<br />factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull; OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the superior<br />achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of OUTSTANDING<br />indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains very<br />significant strengths and no weaknesses.<br />&bull; GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the<br />objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the<br />submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.<br />&bull; ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk<br />in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor,<br />the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not significantly detract from the<br />submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional<br />features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish<br />the quality of the effort or increase the risks of failure.<br />&bull; UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate to excessive<br />risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE<br />rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains<br />significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. The Offeror's interpretation of the<br />Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or<br />incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.<br />&bull; NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.<br />* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is<br />neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment of the<br />technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific <br />USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 25 years.<br />Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present<br />contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in<br />the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,<br />Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and<br />Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another<br />day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)<br />(See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

1. Scope:  In 1995 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designed and developed a public website known as SEC.gov.  This website is now a vast repository of SEC documents and other selected securities-related information.  The website serves as a reference and research database for SEC staff.  The website also serves as a reference, research, and educational tool for the professional and general public.  To better serve SEC staff and the public, the SEC requires that a vendor provide the SEC with the most current version of securities-related laws for dissemination on the public website.  

2. Requirements: The SEC requires that the most current versions of the following public laws shall be made available on the public website (www.sec.gov):

	Investment Company Act of 1940
	Investment Advisers Act of 1940
	Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970

The vendor shall deliver the public laws electronically via DVD and electronic mail.
The vendor shall provide these securities laws to the SEC electronically in PDF format and in text format.  The PDF version shall be formatted to SEC specifications.

When Congress passes a law that affects the SEC (such as the Dodd-Frank Act) which amends existing law (such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the vendor shall provide versions of both the public law as signed by the President and the existing law as amended in its codified form.

When Congress passes a law that affects the SEC which is a stand-alone act (such as the Investment Advisers Act of 1940), the vendor shall provide a version of that public law as signed by the President.

The vendor shall update these laws and provide updates to the SEC no later than 14 calendar days after the law is updated by Congress.

If an error is detected in the vendor-provided data, the vendor shall be notified.  The vendor shall provide a corrected version via DVD to the SEC within 7 calendar days of notification.

The support services necessary include providing maintenance patches, training, support for military exercises, and 24 hour technical support for fielded CASS software versions. TACP CASS (v) 1.4.4 is currently in development but will not be completed under the existing Navy Delivery Order Contract. The government intends to award a sole source contract in Apr 2011 for continued design and development of CASS Version (v) 1.4.4 Software, and the support effort for currently fielded CASS versions. This contracting action will be used to "bridge" current requirements with future CASS version software development and sustainment, and has an estimated value of less than $10 Million. The follow on effort is planned to be solicited to Industry at a later date for future software version development and fielding. Upon award of the "bridge" contract, the contractor will be expected to maintain current schedule which requires the start of Operational Test in August 2011 and fielding in April 2012. CASS Software (v) 1.4.4 provides critical enhancements that can be used to communicate with various types of platforms over various networks. TACP units communic! ate with other ground units and with aircraft via direct radio contact using Variable Message Format (VMF), Air Force Application Program Development (AFAPD), or Marine Tactical Standard (MTS) and via the Link-16 network or the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) network. The TACP-M Program is working toward satisfying all current software requirements with the fielding of each TACP CASS spiral. Currently, TACP CASS Software (v) 1.4.1 is fielded on the Dismounted systems and also on the Air Support Operations Center Gateway (ASOC GW). TACP CASS Software (v) 1.4.2 is currently in the final stages of fielding and will replace TACP CASS (v) 1.4.1 and will also reside on the Gateway-Lite (GWL), MRAP, and Stryker systems. TACP CASS (v) 1.4.4 is currently in development and has recently completed Critical Design Review and is expected to be fielded in 2012, replacing TACP CASS (v) 1.4.2.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking qualified sources for science, operations, maintenance, information technology, communications, engineering and construction support for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). The USAP represents the national effort for scientific research in Antarctica. Individuals from various U.S. academic institutions, working under grants awarded by NSF, and personnel from other federal agencies perform research and specialized services in the Antarctic under USAP auspices. The contractor&rsquo;s primary role is to provide the aforementioned support for individuals deploying to Antarctica -- including deploying the researchers and their cargo, ensuring their survival and safety, and enabling the performance of field and laboratory work while deployed. The primary function is performed within the context of sustaining the existing infrastructure, and establishing new support facilities and/or capabilities as required by the NSF. To perform these functions the Government provides substantial support from its own resources (primarily property, equipment, and transportation). Presently, operations are staged from Port Hueneme, CA; Christchurch, New Zealand; and Punta Arenas, Chile. The USAP maintains three permanent stations in Antarctica: McMurdo Station on Ross Island at 77&deg; 51&rsquo;S, 166&deg; 40&rsquo;E; Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at 90&deg;S; and Palmer Station on Anvers Island at 64&deg; 46&rsquo;S, 64&deg; 03&rsquo;W. Other camps and locations are occupied on a seasonal or temporary basis. Oceanographic research is performed from the Ice Breaking Research Vessels Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M. Gould. A draft Statement of Objectives is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the USAP and the respondent&rsquo;s potential ability to meet NSF&rsquo;s requirement. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify interested vendors &ndash; large businesses, small businesses, non-profits or other interested parties and to determine if a set-aside is warranted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561210 - Facilities Support Services, which has a small business size standard of $32.5M. Only a brief statement of qualifications (not to exceed ten (10) pages) is requested at this time. At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal: 1) Name of company; 2) Name of company&rsquo;s point of contact, including address, phone, and e-mail; 3) Identify the type of entity (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, non-profit institutions, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business or service disabled veteran-owned small business, and also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned); and, 4) Identify intent to team, and, if possible, the anticipated teaming arrangement. Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements, or serve as a prime systems integration contractor to perform the requirements, contained in the draft Statement of Objectives. General marketing material should not be included. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis nor will it reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government&rsquo;s acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes. NSF reserves the right to independently verify all information submitted. Interested vendors are encouraged to identify themselves as such at the FedBizOpps website for purposes of furthering teaming arrangements and subcontracting opportunities. Submittals may be made individually or as a prospective team. Send submittals to: National Science Foundation, Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, ATTN: Ms. Karen Millisor, Contracting Officer, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 or e-mail to kmilliso@nsf.gov. Submittals are requested within 15 calendar days from publication of this synopsis. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. An advisory multi-step process may be employed as part of this acquisition (see FAR Subpart 15.202) at a later date. A tentative milestone schedule for the USAP competition along with other USAP information can be located at the USAP website at http://www.nsf.gov/about/contracting/rfqs/support_ant/index.jsp.

<DESC><strong>UPDATE 8/19/2010<br /></strong><br />The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to execute a contract modification to extend the period of performance for an additional six (6) months to contract number N00019-09-D-0023 for the overhaul &amp; repair of T-34 and T-44 landing gear. NAVAIR originally intended to negotiate and award two (2) modifications to this contract: The first modification would have been to exercise the option for increased quantity at current contract prices for a period not to exceed six months, inclusive of any options; and the second modification would have included an extension that was to be negotiated and awarded, for a period of one year, until the current T-34/T-44 landing gear contract could be recompeted and awarded on 1 April 2012 under a full and open competition. This is no longer the case as NAVAIR has decided not to recompete this effort under full and open competition and will instead in-source the effort by utilizing the Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) southwest located in San Diego, California starting on 1 April 2010 or possibly sooner.
<p>NAVAIR intends to extend the period of performance for this contract with L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC of Madison, MS, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements) to enable NAVAIR and the FRC southwest to properly develop a schedule as well as form all the necessary business relationships and set up a supply chain with industry. The incumbent contractor, L-3, is the only company that is in the immediate position to perform the required tasking for the period of time required. Furthermore, any contractor other than the incumbent would be required to complete an inventory of all the GFE associated with this contract, coordinate with the unions concerning employment of the personnel covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements and establish a management and administrative infrastructure at the various places of performance. These required activities would lead to a potential gap in service and have an impact on CNATRA being able to meet its training mission. It is also not in the best interest of a new contractor because of the performance period being only 6 months.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. This synopsis is provided for information purposes only. A determination not to compete this proposed extension is solely within the discretion of the United States Government. <br /><br />See Government-side Numbered Note 22</p>

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1.
  A project is currently defined as a single task order, a stand-alone contract, or an IDIQ-type contract.  Does work performed at a specific installation via multiple contract task orders under a single ID/IQ contract meet this definition of a project?  

A1.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q2.  Under Criteria 1, the experience is limited to work performed through June 2010.  Would NAVFAC consider extending this period through at least September 30, 2010?

A2.  This date range was posted in error.  Please see the revisions above.

Q3.  Criteria 4 Safety, subsection 3  Citations requires that we submit copies of Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA-type citations for the last three years.
  Are those considered to be part of the total page count?

A3.  No, the citation submissions will not be included in the total page count.

Q4.  Under Criteria 9, contractors are required to submit three Individual Subcontracting Reports.  Are those considered to be part of the total page count?

A4.  No, the Individual Subcontracting Reports will not be included in the total page count.

A8.  This contract is a follow-on procurement to the following existing CLEAN contract:
N62470-08-D-1000 with CH2M Hill, Inc.  

Q9.  In several of the past NAVFAC Atlantic contract proposals, contractors were requested to submit a draft small business plan in a format provided by NAVFAC.
   Should we use the same format for the subject CLEAN solicitation?

A9.  Please use the attached Small Business Subcontracting Plan template. 

Q10.  Would the Environmental Consultant selected for the RFP need a presence in MD, NC, VA, and WV?  We are very qualified for this work and have experience working internationally, but we do not have an office in each of the states listed. Could we be considered for the NC and VA portions only?  Or could we be considered for all the states and manage the projects from an out-of-state office?

A10.  Please respond in accordance with the evaluation criteria.  One contractor will be selected for all geographical areas included in the contract scope.

Q11.
  Is this an unrestricted solicitation (i.e. not just for small business)?

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-2, Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5)

1.  The VA Long Beach Network 22 Contracting Activity Logistics Office, 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, California, intends to enter into a Contract that will require justification for other than full and open competition.  This VA Greater Los Angeles, Healthcare System has a requirement for B401 CSI Mental Health Building Parking and Site Improvement, Los Angeles, California

2.  This is a request for approval to issue a Sole Source contract to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the provisions of Public Law 109-461.

3.  Contractor to furnish all labor, material, equipment and tools necessary to design-build services for parking lot and sight improvements between Building 500 (the main hospital and building 401 (CSI Mental Health Building). The estimated value of this contract is between $25,000.00 to $100,000.00.

4.  The contract shall be issued under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (5) permitting other than full and open competition, and per FAR Subpart 6.3, paragraph 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute. In accordance with FAR 6.302 Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition this statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business contract valued more than $25,000 (simplified acquisition threshold) and less than $5,000,000 (authority ceiling limit). 

5.  This action requires the use of the cited authority in meeting the socio-economic goals established for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The proposed contractor (Morse & Boston Construction, Inc) meets the statutory criteria, and is registered and listed in the VetBiz registry as a SDVOSB contractor. 

6.  Competition was not sought for this acquisition. Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) a sole-source set-aside is authorized for acquisitions for an amount more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold but not exceeding $5,000,000.

7.  The anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable to the government based on using service estimate.

8.  In an effort to support VAs socio-economic goals, the undersigned conducted market surveys (via both VetBiz.com and the Central Contractor Registration web sites) for qualified SDVOSB enterprises. The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is registered and certified in the VA VetBiz.gov database and qualifies as small in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement. All actions considered, no further effort was made to seek additional sources.

9.  The subject project was solicited and negotiated with the contractor in Fiscal Year 2010.  The best and final price was reached through a series of cost negotiations and was ultimately determined to be fair and reasonable.  It is in the best interest of the patients, staffs and government to install a pathway for V.A. patients traveling from Building 500 to Building 401. The existing pathway has created unsafe and hazardous conditions for patients.  The sidewalk on the west side of Building 500 has a height of more than 9 inches,  and broken pavement that contributes to unsafe conditions.  The existing pathway exposes patients to tripping hazards or severe fallings that can occur at any time. Time is crucial to safeguard the well being and health of critical V.A. patients and ensure safe travel to Building 401. Morse & Boston Construction Inc is a new Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  This opportunity will give them an opportunity to expand their business and the VA to bring in a new SDVOSB into the list of construction contractors. This procurement is an emergency order that requires expedition because of danger to the health and well being of V.A. critical patients.
