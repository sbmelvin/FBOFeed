<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a> on the issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;10/31/14</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Alfa Laval Inc. (71871).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) forensic case management software tool to be used in the collection, handling, protecting, and preserving of digital forensic evidence.  This application will assist the FAA in maintaining the chain of custody of all digital forensic evidence collected by the agency.  The application will be hosted on a centrally located file server and maintained in-house.  The intended result of the application is to create a remotely accessible depository where Digital Media Analysts (DMA) can store digital forensic evidence; distribute forensic workload among geographically dispersed investigators, allow digital evidence to be analyzed remotely using centralized forensic tools, allow read-only access by investigators to access reports and data vital to their investigations, and track workflows and deadlines.

The application must have the capability to read from bit-to-bit copies, such as .dd and .E01 formats and password protect these images at both the case and file level.

The following contracts may be extended for an additional six (6) months. An increase to the current maximum ordering value of $5.6B is not required, as the current value is considered more than sufficient to cover orders issued under the SEWP IV contracts.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a Standalone Repair Order for an FMS requirement which will support the repair of 1 line item components, NSN 9200-00-887-1905, P/N H60H0409.  Items will be repaired by Parker Hannifin (59211) located in Irvine, CA.  These items are sole source to Parker.  Even though these items are sole source to Parker, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the Contract Specialist Jacob Segal at (215) 697-4835.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at âhttps://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_oppsâ or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command Technology Applications Contracting Office has a requirement to provide Life Cycle Contractor Support for sustainment of AN/APQ-174B Radar and AN/APQ-187 Radar systems and subsystems. This support includes depot level maintenance support and repair, spare and repair parts management, sustainment, programmatic support, technical guidance, a Reliability Improvement Program, technical supply management, on-site customer service support, sourcing of technical data for publications and training, support and test equipment maintenance, and on-site training for unit personnel for the MMR/SKR systems installed Special Operations Aircraft. This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract is expected to begin on 1 July 2015 with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods, ending on or about 30 June 2020.
<p>The Government expects to negotiate and award this requirement on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, to Raytheon Company, 2501 W. University Drive, McKinney, TX 75071-2813. The Government possesses neither the required level of engineering nor the software documentation necessary to complete the above tasks. As the designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer of the MMR and SKR systems, Raytheon owns all proprietary data rights to these systems and is not currently receptive to the concept of selling these data rights to the Government or competitors, necessitating sole source negotiation and award. Parties that feel they can provide this service are encouraged to identify themselves. While this notice is not a request for competitive proposal, the Government will consider all proposals received by the response date specified in this announcement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the US Army Product Director Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD-PNT), is conducting a market research to seek information on the state of the art and the ability of industry to support the development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.   <br>  <br> Background and Description: <br>  <br> This Request for Information (RFI) by the Army seeks industry feedback on the latest state of the art position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites and the ability of industry to support development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.  <br>  <br> GPS Pseudolites are systems that can be deployed terrestrially or near-terrestrially that transmit signals that are similar to GPS Satellite signals. Pseudolite technology has been shown to enable suitably programmed GPS receivers (e.g. software only modifications) to determine their position, velocity and time even under severe electromagnetic interference (jamming). The technology, as demonstrated, has little or no adverse impact on unmodified GPS receivers (military or civilian). The Army plans on deploying pseudolite transmitters on: land vehicles, namely trucks and combat vehicles, and aircraft such as unmanned air vehicles and lighter than air platforms. <br>  <br> The technologies sought should be other than Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Sensor technologies. Examples of technologies to consider are: Celestial, terrain matching, geophysical matching, and signals of opportunity. Technological approaches are not limited to these examples. Addressees are encouraged to submit any and all technologies that can be used as a source of own position for GPS Pseudolites.  <br>  <br> Requested Information:   <br>  <br> The Government is requesting contractors provide sufficient information in the form of a white paper which demonstrates that the contractor can develop and support this capability.  White papers can address any or all of the above described requirements.  White Papers are limited to 10 pages and should include: <br>  <br> 1) Description of past performance regarding development and manufacture of the technologies submitted in response to this RFI.  <br>  <br> 2) Approach for providing the technology device or concept. <br>  <br> 3) Input on the schedule and Rough Order of Magnitude cost that it would take to develop the technology to the point that it can be successfully tested in the field (Technology Readiness Level 5). <br>  <br> 4) Identify any dependencies or external references the submitted technology requires.  <br>  <br> 5) Name, telephone number, street address and email address for Program, Technical and Cost information. <br>  <br> Responses: <br>  <br> In addition interested sources are requested to submit a brief summary of capabilities to include in-house capability versus outside resources (i.e. subcontractors/teaming arrangements), and complete the enclosed questionnaire to include information such as company size, past performance information, facility security classification currently held, and pertinent points of contact. <br>  <br> All responses shall be unclassified. In order to receive classified or For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, interested parties must provide the following information to the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP): <br>  <br> Company Name: <br> Company Cage Code: <br> Corporate Mailing Address: <br> Classified Mailing Address: <br> Security Office Information: <br> Name/Title: <br> Email: <br> Phone: <br>  <br> All submissions must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font), e-mailed to [contracting office to insert], and [contracting office to insert].

STATEMENT OF WORK
VHA 16 South Central Nurse Staff Scheduling System and Implementation

Background
Currently, there is no real-time dynamic, integrated system that provides comprehensive and systematic accounting of nursing workload; frequency, intensity and duration of patient care needs; staffing requirements; and scheduling needs to meet federal law and other regulatory requirements. 

This request seeks a solution to automate scheduling and staffing processes, provide decision support for staff assignments based on the objective and verifiable data, match nursing competency to patient needs, allow self-scheduling options to nursing staff, and provide data for outcome measurements. This will enable VISN 16 and the Office of Nursing Services (ONS) to create strategic plans based on retrievable and accurate data. The system will accommodate today's increasing staffing challenges through the integration of informatics, decision support systems, and technology.  

Staff scheduling involves staff planning, including adherence to VA Directive 5011/2, and VA Handbook 5011 Hours of Duty and Leave.  This system also allows each VISN 16 participating facility to accurately account for time and pay in accordance with defined payment schedules.   Nurse managers must have the flexibility to determine the appropriate nursing staff to meet patient care needs, while considering a constellation of important variables, to include, but not be limited to the following: scheduled, unscheduled and military leave, FMLA, education/training, experience, orientation/validation of staff competencies, temporary staff,  frequency, intensity and duration of patient care needs (on all tours of duty), physical layout of the unit, availability of hospital support staff and other resources, technology and contingency plans, and unit turbulence   the number of admissions, discharges and transfers), and medical emergencies.

Objectives
There is a need for a system to match the changing care needs of the patients with the appropriate Nursing Hours Per Patient Day (NHPPD) and skill mix.  

Hospital-based staffing requires 24-hour coverage per day, 7 days a week.  Nursing staff work a variety of shifts that require an hourly rate increase, and contract, agency and travel nurses all have different compensation requirements. Therefore, a Staff Scheduling system needs to accurately correlate and calculate time and cost by work unit, skill mix (e.g., RN, LPN) and pay variables. 

Nurse executives need accurate and timely data to plan for current and future staffing needs and costs. This system will provide the tools needed to help manage their workforce; hence, providing quality, efficient, cost-effective care.  Multiple standardized reports as well as ad hoc reports will provide essential data needed to track and trend the reliability and effectiveness of the system.    The system of choice will be able to provide an interface with VistA and/or VATAS, the timekeeping systems currently in use in VHA.

Scope
Integrated systems and automated data extraction tools are necessary to efficiently and effectively assign staffing resources and monitor standards of care.  This system will pull from existing systems that already have the data stored to avoid duplication of effort, and will feed the other downstream data systems.

The primary use of the system will be for staffing and scheduling, thus allowing managers the ability to coordinate schedules, collect, track and analyze data, generate reports, and coordinate work assignments to meet patient care needs.


Tasks or Requirements
"	Appropriate response to the fluctuations in patient census and the frequency, intensity and duration of patient care needs by using embedded decision support tools. 
"	Adequate staffing levels based on the frequency, intensity and duration of patient care needs and other care related variables.
"	Ability for the nurse managers to set staffing level parameters to prevent over or understaffing of the units when using self-scheduling option.  
"	Calculate Nursing Hours per Patient Day (NHPPD) and skill mix by percentage.
"	Compliance with VA Directive 5011/2, and VA Handbook 5011 Hours of Duty and Leave and other regulatory mandates for staffing regulations and monitors.  
"	Collection of data to prepare staffing reports, develop strategic plans and improve hiring practices. 
"	Ability to create reports regarding licensure, certifications, emergency notifications, staff assignment codes, etc. 
"	Generation of predefined and ad hoc reports. 
"	Self-scheduling ability (major nursing satisfier). 
"	Accurate accounting of contract, agency and travel nursing utilization. 
"	Controlled access login 
"	Will eliminate the duplication of documentation of employee work schedules by managers and timekeepers. 
"	Shall eliminate the need for staff to enter requests for leave into two systems.

Selection Criteria
Offeror shall provide equipment that meets or exceeds the following requirements. Responses shall include a statement of compliance to each bullet item, utilizing the provided format, and a succinct description that permits technical evaluation of features and functionalities. A Best Value contract will be awarded based on technical evaluation, past performance, and price.

"	Enable Nurse Manager to balance and approve schedules before posting
"	Ability to process 8, 10, and 12 hour shift combinations
"	Allows Nurse Manager to make changes for staff members after schedule is approved and posted
3.	The software would include Staffing Methodology parameters for target NHPPD and high and low variance limits Track 1:1 hours by purpose for SI, HI, Fall Prevention, or maintenance of therapy Proficiency System:
"	Ability to generate and maintain repositories of anecdotal notes for proficiency input, specialty certification tracking, licensure tracking, education (all degrees earned, skill-based competencies tracking, ACLS/131.5 tracking, continuing education tracking, mandatory education tracking, mandatory health information, tools for staff to self-report professional portfolio)  
4.	Rule engines to facilitate scheduling: Apply regulations - hour limits, time off requirements, staffing skill mix and NHPPD, etc. - as they apply to individuals being scheduled to work:
"	Apply union requirements stored in the system to create staffing schedules so that schedules follow AFGE, NAGE and other union agreements.
"	Use staff preferences to create staffing schedules
"	Match competencies to staffing needs; match nursing staff with patient needs across the system while maintaining balanced patient workloads
"	Consider permanent schedule requests when generating schedules
"	Apply rotating shifts rules within union agreements when generating schedules

<DESC>I. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL), a SAVER Technical Agent, is seeking information on commercially available small package X-ray systems. This RFI is limited to cabinet-type X-ray systems designed for security checkpoints with tunnel dimensions no greater than 70 centimeters (27.6 inches) in either width or height.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. Located within the Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) of DHS, the SAVER Program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercial equipment and systems and provides those results along with other relevant equipment information to the emergency response community in an operationally useful form. Information provided by the SAVER Program will be shared nationally with the responder community, providing a life- and cost-saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders. For more information on the SAVER Program, visit the SAVER website at http://www.firstresponder.gov/saver.</p>
<p>SAVER provides information on equipment that falls within the categories listed in the DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL). The AEL item number for the subject equipment is 15SC-00-PPSS. The target audience for this information is transportation or facility security personnel and their purchasing agents.</p>
<p><br />II. SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>Respondents are required to complete an online Product Summary Questionnaire for each product. The questionnaire may be accessed at the following website: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SmallPackageX-ray</p>
<p>The Product Summary Questionnaire includes questions seeking the following specific information: <br />1. Company's name<br />2. Company's address<br />3. Point(s) of contact (name, e-mail, and phone number)<br />4. Product name, description, specifications, and features<br />5. Cost information</p>
<p>All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used in SAVER Program documentation; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this Request for Information must be submitted to Cecilia Murtagh not later than 4:00 PM EST, October 30, 2014. All technical comments, inquiries, and responses should be directed to Cecilia Murtagh via email at cecilia.murtagh@hq.dhs.gov; all non-technical questions should be directed to Ms. Sharon Flowers, DHS Contracting Officer, via email at Sharon.Flowers@hq.dhs.gov.</p>
<p><br />III. OTHER</p>
<p>The submitted information will be evaluated for inclusion in SAVER projects and reports. Determination as to an individual product's suitability will be made by NUSTL based on the objectives of this request. Therefore, requests for feedback should not be made through the Federal Business Opportunities posting agency. Vendors may be contacted following submission for more detailed product information. Vendor provided information may be reformatted for publication in SAVER Program documents.</p>
<p>This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Submission of vendor information constitutes consent to publication of that information in SAVER Program documentation.</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PM GCTT) has a requirement to convert the three Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 Advanced Gunnery Training System (AGTS) training devices at Ft. Carson, Colorado from relocatable systems to mobile systems. The contractor will produce three new mobility systems (without crewstations) based on the existing designs for already-fielded systems and deliver them to the site. Once on-site, the existing crewstations will be removed from Ft. Carson's relocatable systems, installed into the new mobility systems, and tested for full functionality.  The new mobility systems will support the requirement for moving the existing AGTS systems to a new location. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates executing a modification to the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract W900KK-09-D-0314-0013 to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (LM MST) under the PEO STRI Omnibus Contract II (STOC II). <br>  <br> This order will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark  <br>  <br> Only LM MST can successfully perform the effort because the prime contractor alone possesses the required system technical data and knowledge needed to integrate subsystems effectively to meet user performance criteria.  Consequently, the proprietary design of AGTS as described herein is unique to LM MST.  Since upgrades and improvements will use the existing AGTS as a basis for the upgraded components, knowledge of the existing system is imperative in order to ensure a smooth transition between the current AGTS and the improved AGTS configuration. <br>  <br> ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $1.2M <br>  <br> PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY:  Production, delivery, installation, and testing of the new mobility systems will be due one year after contract award. <br>  <br> RESPONSES REQUESTED:  Contractors who believe they have the ability to meet the requirement to provide mobility systems for the existing relocatable Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS training devices at Ft. Carson, Colorado shall submit an affirmative, written response, not to exceed 10 pages, indicating their ability to meet the specific requirements outlined above.  Responses should appear on company letterhead and include any applicable pricing data or information.  All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number and an e-mail address. <br>  <br> Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  <br>  <br> Responses shall be furnished electronically to the contact listed below, not later than 3:00 PM EDT, October 30th, 2014. <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement. <br>  <br> POC: <br> Mr. Brian Serra <br> brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil   <br> 407-208-3357 <br>

<a href="mailto:david.d.robledo.civ@mail.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>RFI - Army Dental Command (DENCOM) Dental Services <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of Army Dental Command (DENCOM), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with the analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues. <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication that CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future Solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government's requirement is to obtain a personal services contract to provide dental services to eligible beneficiaries of the military health care system in support of the Army Dental Command (DENCOM) for performance within the Continental United States (CONUS) to include Alaska and Hawaii.  These services are to be performed by doctors in the disciplines of General Dentistry, Endodontists, and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.  Ancillary support includes Dental Hygienists, Dental Assistants, Dental Therapy Assistants, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Dental Assistants, Dental Laboratory Technicians, Porcelain Ceramists Laboratory Technicians, and Dental Ceramo-Metal Laboratory Technicians.  Contract Service Providers (CSPs) will work under the control and general supervision of the DENTAC Commander and/or Officer-in-Charge of the Dental Clinic, or his or her representative.  This requirement is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity task order type contract with composite burdened labor rate pricing on a Firm Fixed Priced basis.  This will result in the award of three (3) separate regional contracts consisting of performance in the following regions:  (1) Northern Regional Dental Command (RDC); (2) Southern RDC; and (3) Western RDC and Pacific RDC (two RDC's combined) (see Exhibit C, DENCOM Clinic Locations).  When a solicitation is issued, offerors will have the opportunity to propose on one, two or all three regions.  Composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> This personal services requirement is intended to create an employer-employee relationship between the Government and the individual contract Health Care Providers (HCPs) only to the extent necessary for providing the dental services required under this contract.  The performance of dental services by the individual contract HCPs are subject to the same day-to-day supervision and control by health care facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service HCPs engaged in the delivery of comparable dental services.  The contract HCPs shall work under the direction and general supervision of the Dental Activity (DENTAC) Commander or his Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Dental Clinic.  All persons performing work under the contract shall be and shall remain employees of the contractor and are not employees of the Government.  A  quote mark draft quote mark  Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) that might result from this survey would have a period of performance of a base year and 4 one-year options.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 621210 and the small business size standard is $7.0M.  <br>  <br> The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the Army DENCOM requirements.  We recommend that you first review the  quote mark draft quote mark  PWS so that you may have a better insight on the questions below. <br>  <br> 1.  What are the customary commercial practices for providing these types of services for non-governmental entities, e.g., contract type, pricing structure, task order driven contract, etc.?   <br>  <br> 2.  Reference PWS paragraph 5.4, On-Call Services.  What are the customary commercial practices for providing on-call services for non-governmental entities?   <br>  <br> 3.  Based on your experience, what is the most cost effective contract type and payment method (i.e., monthly firm fixed-price, separate price per service (price list), cost reimbursement, or combination, etc.)? <br>  <br> 4.  Is 30 days a sufficient amount of time for a contractor to prepare a proposal given the scenario of a full trade-off best value source selection requiring a technical and price proposal, as well as past performance references?  If 30 days is not sufficient, please provide a reasonable timeframe to prepare a proposal and rational for your time frame. <br>  <br> 5.  We anticipate a 2-month transition period for the contractor to perform pre-contract functions in order to be ready to begin full performance of the PWS by the contract start date.  This effort will not be separately priced in the contract.  These efforts include but are not limited to:  personnel recruitment and hiring efforts; complete credentialing and employment packages, training, security requirements, obtaining CACs and completion of an inventory changeover of Government furnished equipment/material, when applicable.  Is a 2-month period a sufficient amount of time?  Based on your experience for similar efforts, should this period be shorter or longer and if so explain why?  Does the PWS paragraph 1.6.1. address all the efforts that may be entailed in a transition-in period? <br>  <br> 6.  When nearing completion of this type of contract, is a 2-month transition-out period adequate (see PWS 1.6.2.)?  If not, what do you recommend? <br>  <br> 7.  Do you have a catalog or other published product literature including pricing for these or similar services?  If so, please provide this information. <br>  <br> 8.  Does your company have standard commercial rates utilized for private industry contracts for these types of services?  If so, please describe.  If not, are you aware of other companies that have commercial rates for these types of services?  If so, please explain. <br>  <br> 9.  Do you have a GSA schedule for this type of requirement with composite rates covering the RDC regions?  If so, are there any labor categories that are not included in your schedule?  Regarding Exhibit C, are there any performance locations that would not be included on the GSA schedule? <br>  <br> 10.  Can a single composite rate be developed for each labor category to cover pricing for the geographically dispersed locations within each of the 3 regional contracts (see Enclosure 1, Estimated FTEs and Exhibit C, DENCOM Clinic Locations)?  Note:  For the combined Western and Pacific RDCs, composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> 11.  The Government will provide the performance locations by region and the estimated labor hours per labor category.  Is there any other type of data do you recommend the government provide to industry in order for you to provide composite burdened firm fixed price labor rates (within each region) that are realistic? <br>  <br> 12.  Are any of the labor categories (e.g., General Dentistry, Endodontists, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Dental Hygienists, etc.) difficult to recruit and retain?   <br> Also, are any of the locations within each region (Exhibit C) considered  quote mark hard to fill quote mark  areas?  If so, please identify the positions/locations and provide an explanation. <br>  <br> 13.  Are the required performance measures in the Performance Requirements Summary (Exhibit B to PWS) achievable?  If not, please be specific on which areas would not be and state the reasons why and provide recommendations. <br>  <br> 14.  Are there any innovative approaches used by your company for this type of service?  If so, please explain. <br>  <br> 15.  What makes your company a market leader for this type of service? <br>  <br> 16.  Do you have past performance for similar Dental Services in this PWS at multiple geographically dispersed locations of similar magnitude?   If so, please provide the following information for each relevant contract:  (1) name of your customer; (2) contract number; (3) contract start date; (4) contract length; (5) total dollar value for all periods; (6) place of performance; (7) type of labor categories; and (8) a brief description of services.  ?   <br>  <br> 17.  For NAICS 621210 - Offices of Dentists, Small Business Size Standard $7.0M, is your company considered a small business?  If your company is a small business, do you fall under any small business subcategory (SDB, SDVOSB, Hub Zoned, 8a, etc)?  If you are an 8a eligible company, please provide current status regarding your scheduled graduation date from the 8a program under this NAICS code. <br>  <br> 18.  If you are considered a large business, is there a possibility you may contemplate teaming with a small business for this requirement? <br>  <br> 19.  What is your company's average revenue for the past 3 years? <br>  <br> 20.  What types of internal Quality Control (QC) performance assessment methods are commonly used by your company for dental services?  Would it differ for a personal services contract? <br>  <br> 21.  Would your company be interested in pursuing a Government contract for any of the following regions:  (1) Northern Regional Dental Command (RDC); (2) Southern RDC; and (3) Western RDC and Pacific RDC?  If so, please specify which regions you are interested in. <br>  <br> 22.  Does your company currently possess adequate staffing or have the capability to support one or all of the regions that you are interested in with the required labor categories?

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain feedback from industry in regards to the attached DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW), as well as to obtain responses to the below questions. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to provide the Republic of Chad and the Republic of Niger with identical packages of three (3) 20'-23' riverine boats (total requirement of six (6) boats), as well as accompanying boat outfit items, spare parts, and in-country training support in the Republic of Chad and Niger.</p>
<p>This effort is part of the Department of State's Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) program, and is implemented into the USCG and funded via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Case B1-P-SAA. The US Government has allocated funding via FMS Case B1-P-SAA to enhance Chad and Niger's capacity for policing their local riverine borders.</p>
<p>The USCG anticipates structuring this procurement in a way that maximizes competition while still meeting the stated requirements. The USCG intends to meet the requirements identified above using commercial items, and anticipates setting aside this requirement amongst one of the following socio-econonic business categories: Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZONE), Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>Thus, the USCG seeks responses to this Sources Sought Notice from companies that fall under the above-mentioned socio-economic categories.</p>
<p>The USCG would like any interested parties to review the attached DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW), and to respond to this Sources Sought Notice with a Capabilities Statement which provides the following information:</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed and patented a novel use of a smart optical material for controlling the phase of coherent light. The ferroelectric light control device provides a simple means to control the propagation of light, as might be used for intensity and phase control of laser communications systems, for example. Typical methods employed today for laser phase control include conventional optical components such as lenses, mirrors, or gratings, coupled with a mechanical controller, either an electric motor or actuator, or in some cases a MEMS device. The NASA technology is paradigm shifting in that the need for external control is eliminated. The ferroelectric light control device operates purely in the solid state, using the optical changes in the ferroelectric material as a function of applied electric field in multiple orientations to change the optical transmission properties of the device. The electrodes used to construct the multi-direction ferroelectric light control device are key to its performance. The NASA ferroelectric light control device technology leverages the unique electro-optical properties of known ferroelectric compounds, like barium titanate or lithium niobate, to create a solid state device for controlling the phase and intensity of a laser light beam. The ferroelectric material undergoes spontaneous polarization via induced dipoles in the crystal domains. The key to the NASA device technology is the design of the multiple electrode patterns to control the orientation of applied electric field, along with a combination of multiple device layers, controlled thicknesses, or optical coatings. Specific designs are easily developed and manufactured depending on the end-use application requirements.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a family of chemistries and supporting patents related to a series of liquid crystalline materials that have several distinct advantages over currently available commercial liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). The NASA materials use low-melting, all-aromatic ester-based liquid crystal oligomers end-capped with reactive phenylethynyl end groups. This reactive oligomer approach enables synthesis of liquid crystal thermosets with outstanding mechanical and thermal properties that are superior to well-known high-performance polymers such as PPS and PEEK . NASAs chemistries offer inexpensive and adaptable materials for melt processing complex shapes using resin transfer molding or resin film infusion techniques. The low coefficient of expansion, combined with excellent barrier properties, makes this new technology useful for cryogenic applications and other applications that involve extreme temperature changes. In addition, the excellent barrier properties make these materials chemically resistant to acids, bleaches, chlorinated solvents, alcohols, and hydrocarbon fuels.  Depending on the backbone chemistry and the molecular weight (controlled by reactive end group concentration), NASA has developed various liquid crystalline resins (LCRs) with a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Low concentrations of reactive end groups (e.g., a 9000 g/mol oligomer) give a low viscous thermotropic melt (10200 poise at 100 rad/s). When cured, a high Tg (>200C) nematic thermoset is obtained that provides an excellent combination of toughness and stiffness. U.S. Patents 7,507,784 and 6,939,940, which are both titled Liquid Crystalline Thermosets from Ester, Ester-Imide, and Ester-Amide. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a unique concept for providing electrical power to high-altitude airships (HAA). These airships are intended to remain aloft at high altitudes for extended periods of time for various potential scientific, commercial, and defense uses. Powering HAA presents a challenge due to the extended periods between possible refueling and the weight restrictions of these lighter-than-air airships. The advanced thermoelectric materials developed by NASA offer distinct weight and performance advantages over conventional photovoltaic systems, and convert the energy from solar radiation in the form of heat directly into electricity.

The telecommunication services provided by A&T Systems, Incorporated are existing services for this location.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur.   

Under the authority FAR Part 8.405-6(b)(1), it allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when "only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work." A&T Systems, Incorporated is the only known local source available to satisfy this current need.

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS.GOV ANNOUNCEMENT: SPECIAL NOTICE
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: Z - Maintenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property</p>
<p>SUBJECT: MARKES THERMAL DESORPTION SYSTEM REPAIR SERVICES</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: SB1341-15-RQ-0004</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: RICHARD KIM, Contract Specialist (301) 975-6219;<br />TODD HILL, Contracting Officer (301) 975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Quantum Analytics, LLC., for the acquisition of Markes Desorption System Repair Services, to be used by the Engineering Laboratory at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>***** Sole source determination is based on the need for repair services for our thermal desorption, multiport sampling and thermal conditioning system to keep it running within manufacturer's specifications. The requirement is to maintain the Markes Desorption System and subsystems, the Multi-Channel Sampler, and the Multi-Tube Conditioner so that the original specifications of the instrument are maintained for its proper function: and analysis of air samples to identify indoor air contaminants and determine indoor air contaminant concentrations. The equipment must be serviced and repaired by an authorized service provider to Markes International. If this equipment is not maintained and functional within the manufacturer's specifications, the project of developing a thin film material emissions standard to enable development of emissions test protocols is no longer viable.<br />It's also critical that the contractor is able to make repairs expediently, within two to three days when failure occurs. The reason for this is that the integrity of test samples degrades after two to three days once prepared for analysis. If degradation occurs, the sample will be of no use and valuable time and money will be lost. The longer the repair time the less likely samples will yield reliable results</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516.</p>
<p>****** A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. However, responses received by October 24, 2014, 2:00 p.m., EST will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>"Head Hurters during the Acquisition Process - with a Twist" Encore
<p>Background: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in partnership with Central Florida Chapter of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) has reestablished the Navy's Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings with Industry</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of the IPT is to:<br />&bull; Remove any unnecessary barriers to reasonable communication and to provide a forum, consistent with existing law and regulation that promotes responsible and constructive exchanges between NAWCTSD and Industry. <br />&bull; Identify and resolve misconceptions about NAWCTSD flexibility regarding Government-vendor communications which hinder requirement transparency<br />&bull; Seek common ground for consistency in Government-vendor communications interface<br />&bull; Provide facts and strategies to help NAWCTSD acquisition professionals benefit from Industry's knowledge and insight.</p>
<p>Rules of Engagement: The IPT Sessions are NOT intended to discuss any current or future Business Opportunities. For capacity reasons, please RSVP to this announcement via the email provided below or to NDIA representative Joel Owens at jowens@camber.com and limit participation to one representative per company. We highly recommend Industry send a representative experienced in the Session Topics the IPT will address. Again, the IPT's are NOT business development meetings.</p>
<p>Topic: <br />The NAWCTSD/Industry IPT October meeting is a presentation for NAWCTSD acquisition professionals on the "Head Hurters during the Acquisition Process, with a twist." This information will be from an industry perspective, and presented by a representative group from large and small businesses! This is a great opportunity to learn from our Industry Partners how, why and when they decide whether to pursue one of NAWCTSD's competitive acquisitions. Industry will discuss the impact, to their organizations, when the Government sends out Request for Information (RFIs) notices, and draft SOWs and SPECs. They will discuss how they use the Training and Simulation Industry Symposium (TSIS) information. This presentation will give the Government valuable insight into the decision making process our Industry Partners encounter when making critical financial, and acquisition decisions when pursuing competitive programs. You will also have the opportunity to ask our Industry Partners questions on their thought processes when pursuing new endeavors.</p>
<p>Please provide any questions that you may have in advance to Orlo_BusinessSupportTeam@navy.mil or you can contact Ms. Diana Teel at 407-380-4903, NAWCTSD Business Support.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Rapid, Portable Viral Diagnostic Available for Licensing</strong></p>
<p>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for a rapid, portable viral diagnostic for RNA viruses. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through November 16, 2014.</p>
<p>RNA viruses represent a significant portion of the high priority pathogens of concern to both human and animal health. The National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases' (NIAID) prioritized listing of human pathogens includes the RNA Viruses: Hanta viruses, Dengue, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Hepatitis A and C, West Nile, and a large number of encephalitis viruses. The USDA prioritized list of infectious animal diseases include four RNA viruses within their top six ranked pathogens; Foot and Mouth Disease Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, common swine fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis. Viral outbreaks of these pathogens have significant direct impact on human health or dramatic indirect impact by their disruption of food supplies and related economic considerations.</p>
<p>Rapid diagnostics are critical elements of an effective response to viral outbreaks, but are limited by both available technology and implementation. ORNL researchers have developed a diagnostic for active, acute viral infection using a highly fieldable, and nearly reagentless system protocol whereby signal is dependent on active viral replication within infected cells.</p>
<p>This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.<br /><br />License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology. If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.<br /><br />Additional background and technical information may be found on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Technology Transfer website at <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/rapid-portable-viral-diagnostic-available-for-licensing">www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/rapid-portable-viral-diagnostic-available-for-licensing</a>.</p>

This contract vehicle will allow DOL to collaboratively provide, with DBCRWS, a skill development program for participating economically disadvantaged high school students from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as well as to identify how such a program can be implemented in the federal government context. Given the students' ages (some of whom would be under 16 years old) and in accordance with the applicable Fair Labor Standards Act requirements (see 29 CFR 570), there are limitations in the type of work to be performed and the hours worked by the students. DBCRWS is the only identified local entity with such a program approved by the Wage and Hour Division under 29 CFR &sect;570.37.</p>
<p>This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Information related to the potential availability of other sources that can fulfill this requirement must be received by the Contracting Officer listed below via electronic mail at Stepney.kim.l@dol.gov no later than 12PM, Eastern Standard Time on October 20, 2014.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.</p>

<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.
<p>*** THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) to contract for any supply or service. DHS DNDO is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the DNDO will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be released via the Government-Wide Port of Entry (GPE) at (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor the website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the DNDO, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>DNDO is seeking alternative and innovative technological solutions for scanning IMCCs entering the U.S. through sea ports of entry (POE) for radioactive material prior to transferring to rail cars. Intermodal transportation of containerized cargo at terminals that transfer containers from a ship to rail is referred to as "on-dock rail" (ODR).</p>
<p>In this RFI, DNDO is conducting targeted market research to: (1) inform the commercial sector that the Government is looking for innovative or improved approaches to this detection challenge without inhibiting the flow of commerce; and (2) determine industry capability to detect and identify radiological/nuclear threat sources and weapon components that may be smuggled in intermodal cargo containers (IMCC) that are transferred directly from ship to a rail car at seaport terminals and primarily handled by straddle or shuttle carriers for placement in staging and/or scanning areas.</p>
<p>The information provided in response to this RFI may be used to: assess market capabilities; discover alternate or improved technologies or concepts; determine the technical maturity and commercial availability of potential solutions; and support future planning efforts to strengthen the vast Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA) with next generation radiation detection technologies and processes.</p>
<p>Please see the enclosed document for additional information regarding this RFI.</p>
<p>DUE DATE</p>
<p>All final submissions to this RFI must be submitted via email to Lori.Lawson@hq.dhs.gov and Camille.Murray@hq.dhs.gov no later than 4:30 PM (Eastern Time) Wednesday, December 3, 2014.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to satisfy the requirement at FAR 8.402(f) to publicize the addition of items not on the Federal Supply Schedule in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1) and (2).   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Jacksonville District (SAJ) has established a Small Business Set-Aside, General Services Administration (GSA), Multiple-Award, Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) in accordance with Federal acquisition regulation (FAR) 8.405-3(c)(2) under GSA Federal Supply Schedule 899-1 - Environmental Consulting Services.   <br> 		 <br> This award was made under NAICS Code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services; the Small Business size standard for this NAICS Code is $14,000,000.   <br>  <br> GSA Federal Supply Schedule 899-1 - Environmental Consulting Services is defined as follows:  The services include, but are not limited to: Planning and Documentation Services for the development, planning, facilitation, coordination, and documentation of and/or for environmental initiatives (or mandates such as Executive Order 13423) in areas of chemical, radiological, and/or hazardous materials; ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) and sustainable performance measure development; Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) preparation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); Endangered species, wetland, watershed, and other natural resource management plans; Archeological and/or cultural resource management plans; Environmental program and project management; Environmental regulation development; Economic, technical and/or risk analysis; other environmentally related studies and/or consultations; Homeland Security solutions that include Biochemical protection; Crime prevention through environmental design surveys (CPTED); Economical, technical and/or risk analysis; Identification and mitigation of threats inclusive of protective measures to mitigate the threats; and Vulnerability assessments.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Intent
<p>The Marine Corps has identified a requirement for a Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) Mod 2. The SMAW Mod 2 will provide an integrated and improved targeting/sighting system over the current Mod 0 design. The intent of Mod 2 is to provide a targeting solution for the current ammunition suite, reduce gunner exposure time, reduce overall system weight, improve reliability, and reduce the maintenance burden.<br /><br />In support of the SMAW requirement, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PM-Infantry Weapon Systems, intends to release a request for information (RFI) in August 2014. Following release of the RFI, PM-IWS intends to hold an industry day in September 2014. Questions concerning the SMAW Mod 2 program will be addressed at the industry day. Release of the final request for proposal is tentatively planned for November 2014. This notice is being provided for situational awareness only. MCSC will not entertain any questions at this time.</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [x] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [x] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>Questions must be submitted by 10:00 AM PST on 20 October 2014 Any questions submitted after that time will not be taken. Please provide 24 hrs for a response. Answers will be submitted on an attachment to the reposting of the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

It is for a lab at Ft. Sam Houston, TX.  <br> Minimum Essential Characteristics (MECs): <br> Brand Name or Equal.  A device for transfection of nucleic acids into difficult-to-transfect cells including stern cells and retinal pigment epithelium derived from stem cells <br> 1) Must be able to efficiently transfect nucleic acids into cells that are typically difficult to transfect; i.e. stern cells. <br> 2) Must require low cell numbers of difficult to growl slow growing cells; i.e. stem cells, retinal pEgment-epritheliurn derived-ffom stern-cells, and primary cells <br> 3) Must be able to transfect cells with minimal cytotoxicity. <br> 4) Must use reagents with one year shelf life at room temperature. <br> 5) Must have adjustable electroporation parameters to optimize conditions according to cell type and nucleic acid payload. <br> 6) Must use a biologically compatible pipette tip chamber that generates a more uniform electric field. This design allows a better maintenance of physiological conditions resulting in very high cell survival compared to conventional electroporation. <br> 7) Must use a simplified transfection kit compatible with all cell types. <br> 8) Must allow a simplified three step transfection procedure as opposed to complicated and cumbersome transfection procedures that increase the likelihood of contamination. <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair or overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010007 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair or overhaul vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component OEM, a capable repair or overhaul vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore, to be considered, must be deemed a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair or overhaul as applicable, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility and no other facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future award consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is EADS CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICASS.A. DBA EADS CASA, AV.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  US Army has a requirement for a neon transfection system: a device for transfection of nucleic acids into difficult-to-transfect cells including stern cells and retinal pigment epithelium derived from stem cells. It is for a lab at Ft. Sam Houston, TX.   <br>  Minimum Essential Characteristics (MECs):  <br>  Brand Name or Equal.  A device for transfection of nucleic acids into difficult-to-transfect cells including stern cells and retinal pigment epithelium derived from stem cells  <br>  1) Must be able to efficiently transfect nucleic acids into cells that are typically difficult to transfect; i.e. stern cells.  <br>  2) Must require low cell numbers of difficult to growl slow growing cells; i.e. stem cells, retinal pEgment-epritheliurn derived-ffom stern-cells, and primary cells  <br>  3) Must be able to transfect cells with minimal cytotoxicity.  <br>  4) Must use reagents with one year shelf life at room temperature.  <br>  5) Must have adjustable electroporation parameters to optimize conditions according to cell type and nucleic acid payload.  <br>  6) Must use a biologically compatible pipette tip chamber that generates a more uniform electric field. This design allows a better maintenance of physiological conditions resulting in very high cell survival compared to conventional electroporation.  <br>  7) Must use a simplified transfection kit compatible with all cell types.  <br>  8) Must allow a simplified three step transfection procedure as opposed to complicated and cumbersome transfection procedures that increase the likelihood of contamination.  <br>

No party bidding on the RFSE production effort should rely on this number. <br /><br />28 August 2014: A <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">draft</span></em></strong> contract has been added to the documents for review on 21 August 2014's RFI. Any comments regarding the draft would be greatly appreciated. All other terms and conditions of the 21 August 2014 RFI remain unchanged including the following disclosure:<br /><br />&nbsp;

26 August 2014: A letter explaining the data rights the US Government has in the RFSE data package is attached.<br /><br />25 August 2014: An industry day will be held on 4 September 2014. Please review the attached notice and registration form for more information. Please note that while this Presolicitation Notice states the response is 4 September 2014, that date is for responses to the RFI. Registration is due by 31 August 2014.<br /><br />21 August 2014 Updated sections L and M, updated SOO, and labor <br /><br />matrix/labor categories have been provided. The Air Force invites your feedback on these documents. Please see attached RFI for instructions.<br /><br />5 August 2014&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Questions and answers have been added to the attachments. The Request For Proposal release is still tentatively planned for fall, 2014.<br /><br />28 May 2014 (2). The following documents have been added to the bidder's library on TopVue:<br /><br />The following processes referenced in the TDP:<br />RFE23050010 <br />RFE23050011<br />RFE23050015 <br />RFE-TP23050600 <br />RFE23050012 <br />23039879 <br />47A210105 <br />23039198 <br />23034499 <br />23035692 <br />PSP535149

<br />28 May 2014. An attachment called "Additional Information" has been added to this notice that provides further information on this acquisition.<br /><br />4 April 2014. The acceptance test plan has been included in TopVue for review.<br /><br />On&nbsp;22 January 2014, this notice was amended to update the RFI&nbsp;instructions for access to the bidder's library. The updated RFI instructions inadvertently included language regarding the one-on-one industry day which&nbsp;were confusing when read&nbsp;with the instructions contained in the one-on-one industry day announced in notice FA8214-14-R-9000 Special Notice.&nbsp;Additional other editorial changes were also omitted and an incorrect e-mail address was provided. This modification is to correct these issues. Please reference the new RFI instructions. The corresponding one-on-one industry day special announcement&nbsp;will be&nbsp;updated due to the issues in the&nbsp;22 January 2014 modification of this RFI. To register for the RFSE Industry Day please&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;the special announcement, one-on-one industry day, numbered&nbsp;FA8214-14-R-9000.<br /><br /><br />Directions in the RFI instructions on obtaining access to the bidder's library have changed. In the original instructions, those wanting to view the bidder's library were directed to log onto https://icbm.topvue.com/topvue-icbm/ and request an account linked to the RFSE folder. Please do not request access this way. These requests cannot be answered. Instead, complete the attached account request form (see attachments) and submit it to Peggy Japngie Lizotte at peggy.japngie_lizotte.1@us.af.mil. Subsequently, you will receive an email with a user id, password, and instructions on how to configure the account. Please note that other than the update in the RFI instructions and the addition of the account access form all other&nbsp;documents released when this notice was originally released are still included in this notice.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-045 Towed Airborne Plume Simulator Dynamic Range Improvement </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for a low flow rate pyrophoric fuel valve and control system. The center operates the Towed Airborne Plume Simulator (TAPS), which relies upon the combustion of a pyrophoric fluid to produce signatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current system operates over a flow rate range of 0.2 - 10 cubic inches per sec (cis).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to improve the dynamic range of the system, an additional valve is sought to provide a lower flow rate range: 0.02 - 5 cis preferred, 0.05 - 5 cis acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design of the current valve is not amenable to simply scaling down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The valve must provide good spray atomization over the entire flow range, and be controllable to 1% of full scale.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-046 Missile Radiometric Signature Development</strong></p>
<p>Infrared signatures for testing aircraft missile warning sensors are currently produced by combustion, as in the Towed Airborne Plume Simulator at AEDC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project aims to produce missile radiometric signatures from LWIR through UV without combustion: perhaps through LEDs, lasers like the QCL, or various other means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the safety and precautions associated with pyrophoric fuel are eliminated, and the signatures can be controlled more precisely and over a wider spectral range.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-047 Improved Missile Attitude Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Missile attitude during the initial second after launch is a key parameter in signature prediction models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To validate these models, missile attitude in all three dimensions must be known within one degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One current method uses cameras to view the missile as it flies past a patterned background painted in segments and records the angle measured with respect to that background.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, stereo photogrammetry has been used, but current techniques rely on laborious human-in-the-loop target tracking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alternate solutions may be possible.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-048 Thermal Mapping Camera </strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for a single frame, fast integration, thermal mapping camera to study flow effect on scaled models moving at hypersonic speeds in a long test chamber. The temperatures encountered could be up to 2500 degrees C. Integration times as low as 100 &#414;s is desirable.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-049 Hone Very Long Bore Tapers </strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for the ability to hone the bores of very long (130 ft.) straight tubes to both maintain the surface finish and occasionally to adjust the bore size. Standard long tube equipment is built for honing straight bores and is therefore difficult to manipulate through a tapered bore. A computer controlled hydraulic or servo motor operated hone is required that can hone tapers up to 0.1 inch over the 130- ft.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-050 Improved Hydrogen Launcher Cleaner </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for a hydrogen launch cleaner. The current operation involves a very large two stage hydrogen launcher. The first stage of compression in the launcher uses military grade class 3 propellants. This propellant leaves a heavy residue that must be removed from the first 100 feet of the launcher after every operational cycle. The currently available environmentally approved cleaner is ineffective and leaves the bore less clean than required.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-051 Boundary Layer Observation</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for the ability to observe the boundary layer on subscale models moving at hypersonic speeds. The models are launched at the testing speeds into a 1000 ft. long, 10 ft. diameter test chamber where they are observed through acrylic ports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A high resolution image of the flow phenomena around the model is required to allow the image to be enlarged and interrogated for flow effects like boundary layer transition.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-053 Directed Energy Aero-optic Test Capability for High Speed Testing</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for a directed energy aero-optic test capability for high speed testing. Testing aero-optic systems in large high speed wind tunnels provides an opportunity to evaluate full-scale hardware at flight conditions over a wide range of laser deployment angles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The aero-optic effects of the airframe boundary layer and shear layer on the beam can be quantified only if the facility induced jitter can be subtracted out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recent wind tunnel experiments have confirmed the vibration levels of the wind tunnel structure are low and this wind tunnel will be a suitable site for aero-optics testing.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>-054 Quantum Cascade Laser System</strong></p>
<p>A quantum cascade laser system is required for gas diagnostics in systems-under-test (turbine engine, scramjet, rocket, etc.) exhaust as well as vitiated facility flows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are typically high temperature gas streams 1000K+, low to atmospheric pressure, possibly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>laden with combustion by-product gases (CO, CO2, H2O, NO, etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since our test requirements cover a wide range of test conditions, a single wavelength or multiple fixed wavelength diagnostics system is NOT desired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A need exists for a widely tunable (nominally 200 cm-1) laser system of narrow line width (&lt;2 MHZ, for obtaining spectral data on high temperature gases at low pressures) that operates in the mid-infrared spectral region (2-6 microns) capable of rapid mode-hop free operation over a wide spectral range with power of 10mW or higher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally the system will not require cryogens and is (or can be) easily coupled to fiber optics for delivery and retrieval of the transmitted light from test cell that operates in a harsh environment with difficult optical access.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-055 Real-time Radiography system</strong></p>
<p>Real-time Radiography system is in need of rejuvenation or replacement. The X-ray source, while fully capable of meeting current needs, requires refurbishment as well as modernization of its controls and data acquisition system. The system controls must be updated to ensure remote and coordinated operation with the sensors and data acquisition systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system's low level light sensors and associated recording systems need to be upgraded/replaced with state of the art low light level sensors that can work with current state of the art x-ray conversions screens and allow utilization full capabilities of the source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alternate sensors that operate independent of x-ray screens such as x-ray image sensors or other new technologies will be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mission of this system is to collect real time x-ray scenes at greater than 300 frames per second (synchronized with the x-ray source) of a rocket motor or other articles under test.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-056 Arc heater segments and module assemblies</strong></p>
<p>Additional suppliers are needed for arc heater segments and module assemblies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A design that will lend itself to manufacture by a wide range of competent machine shops and e-beam welding vendors and a methodology for quality testing of manufactured parts to ensure integrity before insertion into the heaters is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an ongoing need and the capability will be utilized as soon as available.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Previous Announcment</strong> <br />The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is pleased to announce a Small Business Industry Day (SBID) to be held in Huntsville, AL during the third week of November 2014.</p>
<p>The AFTC plays a critical role in developmental test and evaluation (T&amp;E) for AFMC's air and ground systems and is an essential cornerstone to the command's consolidation initiative from 12 centers to five.

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>10152015
<CONTACT>Kristen Kachur, 973-724-3217

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of The Department of Defense (DOD) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties of an interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction (OTA) agreement with an eligible entity or group of entities to develop and mature technologies and support policy development to enable advanced approaches to electromagnetic spectrum use. This initiative will support possible needs across the government and industry, in alignment with the National Information Technology R&D (NITRD)/Wireless Spectrum R&D (WSRD) Senior Steering Group (SSG) mission to promote collaboration among government, industry and academia.   The purpose of this effort is to identify areas of Research & Development/Prototyping (R&D/PROTOTYPING) of vital importance to the Department's ability to maintain access to the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  The Government is seeking to facilitate optimal application of SRF funds in developing technologies that enable both spectrum sharing and more efficient spectrum use.    <br>    <br>  Section 845(a) (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. The Government must ensure that, when an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement for a prototype project under this authority, nontraditional defense contractor(s) participate to a significant extent in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.   <br>    <br>  Currently, the Government and industry share a common challenge of satisfying vastly increasing demand for the use of electromagnetic spectrum(s). Multiple efforts are addressing this fundamental issue as it hampers U.S. innovation and economic growth and hinders U.S. military operations both domestically and overseas.   <br>    <br>  The envisioned collaboration between the Government and Industry focuses on (but is not limited to) the following Science and Technology areas for consideration:   <br>    <br>  1.	Investments in Radar-Commercial communications sharing technologies, targeted initially to the 3.5 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  Rationale:  the Department is currently in discussions with both Industry and federal regulators to explore options for sharing portions of these bands with commercial wireless providers.  There is also international interest in sharing these regions of the EMS.  Investments in these technologies will enable the Department to maintain mission effectiveness and operational readiness while supporting our own, and the Nation's, strategic goal of spectrum sharing.  <br>    <br>  2.	Investment in use of Millimeter Wave (MMW) and Free-Space Optical (FSO) technologies for terrestrial and air-ground communications and C2/telemetry applications.  Rationale:  the Department's use of spectrum below 6 GHz for terrestrial and air-ground communications is vital to mission effectiveness; demand for these services is increasing and geographical availability of these spectral regions is static or declining, making sharing with commercial service providers difficult.  This problem is compounded in the case of air-ground communications and C2, where large exclusion zones have been encountered in the AWS-3 auction proceedings due to the nature of the airborne applications.   Investments in MMW and FSO technologies will enable the Department to strategically explore these spectral regions and transition terrestrial and air-ground services into these less congested areas.   <br>    <br>  3.	Development and deployment of the Air/Maritime Training Instrumentation (AMTI) waveform.  Rationale:  The AWS-3 auction proceedings enables commercial access to the lower portion (1755-1780 MHz) while DoD will have access to the upper portion (1780-1850 MHz) indefinitely.  Though this provides commercial access to only a small amount of spectrum, the economic and political situation at the time made this an acceptable solution.  Underlying this solution is the general understanding that industry will be seeking access to the upper portion in the near future.  One of the concepts that has been investigated is modifying the ACTS system to use a much more efficient waveform, the AMTI; using the AMTI will better position the Department to open up additional spectrum access, on a shared basis, with commercial service providers.   <br>    <br>  4.	Investments in Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Frequency Reuse (FR) technologies for communications and radar systems.  Rationale:  As sharing becomes more prevalent, systems will need to adjust dynamically to their current electromagnetic environment (EME) automatically and considering their geospatial and temporal location.  Investments in this area will enable the Department to consider more dynamic sharing scenarios and mechanism and improve reliability and mission effectiveness in spectrally-constrained environments.   <br>    <br>  5.	Investments in algorithms and approaches for improving spectrum situational awareness (SA), spectrum command & control (C2), and management of the electromagnetic environment.  Rationale:  As the Department moves towards sharing, with itself and with commercial service providers, while maintaining our ability to project power globally, it will be vital to improve our ability to maintain positive control of the spectrum resource and solid situation awareness of the spectrum  quote mark terrain quote mark , both from a friendly force and enemy force perspective.  This investment will develop technologies and techniques that can be deployed into land, air, sea, and cyber domain capabilities to achieve spectrum SA and C2 under the auspices of the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) doctrine.  <br>    <br>  6.	Investments in improvements for modeling and simulation of the Electromagnetic Environment (EME).  Rationale:  Emerging results from the DoD EMS Strategy Roadmap and Near-Term Action plan indicate that the Department must improve our ability to model and simulate the EME, to include assessing sharing approaches and techniques, and addressing attending interference and propagation effects.    <br>    <br>  7.	Investments in Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) and other communication and radar waveform efficiency technologies.  Rationale:  As more regions of the spectrum become open to sharing, the Department will need to be more efficient with our available spectrum access.   Investments now in basic and applied R&D/PROTOTYPING will yield useable technologies for programs in a few years at a time when spectrum sharing will be implemented on a wide scale.  <br>    <br>  8.	Interference tolerance and hardening technologies for communications and radar system.  Rationale:  As the department transforms to a share-first model, it will become increasing important for new communications and radar systems to be tolerant of interference that characterizes sharing environments.  Department R&D/PROTOTYPING investments now will create technologies mature enough to be implemented in programs later when spectrum sharing becomes more widespread, both nationally and internationally.  <br>    <br>  9.	Investments in adaptive RF technologies.  Rationale:  In Quadrennial Defense Review 2014, the Department recognized that the EMS, along with international waters and airspace and the cyber domain were vital to the Military's ability to project the force internationally.  As spectrum sharing increases both domestically and internationally, the Department will face additional barriers to spectrum access as it deploys into regions of the globe that either do not support sharing arrangements in particular bands or deny use of those bands.  It is prudent for the Department to invest in technologies now that will enable communications and radar systems to be able to change the spectrum regions in which they operate in response to either enemy action or the exercise of nation-state sovereign rights.  <br>    <br>  It is anticipated that industry members may propose forming a consortium that would seek to work with the Government through an OTA in this area. DOD and NITRD/WSRD recognize that both Government and industry can benefit from an OTA  with a consortium, in order to achieve more rapid contracting, acceleration of discovery, unparalleled ability to tailor research, policy consideration concurrent with technological advances, a more focused and synergistic research agenda, and relief from excessive  requirements.  Any company, university, or research organization is eligible to join the consortium.  The Government is seeking interested parties that are willing to join and/or establish a consortium with collective expertise in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates responses from this announcement from interested parties, with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support the NITRD/WSRD.  Interested parties shall provide a response no later than 4:00 PM EST on 15 November 2014 by email only.  Responses can be sent to Ms. Kristen Kachur, Contract Specialist, via email at kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Responses should contain the interested parties' experience and capability information.  In addition, if any existing consortium wishes to respond as an entity, the response shall include consortium name, vision, mission statement, goals, membership (indicating traditional and nontraditional defense contractors), success criteria, metrics, management framework, articles of collaboration/by-laws, Consortium Member Agreement (CMA), accounting practices, fee structure, and other information which the respondent considers of assistance in developing successful Government/academia/industrial partnerships.

Can the requirements be scaled accordingly to accommodate ranges less than 200 meters in length? <br>   <br> Answer: While a contract modification would be required, the Government will consider alternate test procedures proposed by the contractor.  The test procedures stated in the detail specification are to be tested as stated in section 4 unless an alternate procedure is approved by the Government.  Submission of an alternate test procedure does not guarantee Government approval. <br>  <br> 8. Questions: A significant portion of the TDP requires hardness checks using the Vickers scale. According to MIL-W-13855, hardness requirements shall be checked by using the hardness scale specified on the component drawing or assembly drawing. Can an alternate scale be allowed? If an alternate scale is not permitted, can approval to convert hardness scales to Vickers be provided as another option? <br>  <br> Answer:  After contract award the contractor, under paragraph C.3.10 of the Statement of Work, may prepare ECPs and Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECPs), with NORs and RFVs, which detail the exact change being proposed for the documents in the TDP.  All ECPs submitted by the manufacturing contractor will be reviewed by the Government.  Submission of an ECP does not guarantee Government approval.  At this time, only requirements as stated within the Statement of Work (SOW), Detail Specification, and TDP are approved. <br>  <br> 9. Question:  Has this contract been set aside for small business or not?  <br>  <br> Answer: The Government does not anticipate restricting the M320 GL competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) W15QKN-14-R-0067 to small business. <br>  <br> 10. Questions: At this time, are there any specific objectives that the government is trying to meet regarding future procurement of this item? <br>  <br> Answer: The Government cannot anticipate specific objectives for future procurement of this item  <br>  <br> 11. Question: Multiple steel components in this TDP have a material callout of SAE 5115 with no alternates listed. No domestic (US) suppliers produce this steel in anything less than mill-run quantities.  Can alternate materials such as 4140, 4340, or 1095 be added?  <br> Parts affected by this requirement include: <br>  <br> 13051122 Pin, Hook  <br> 13051121 Hook  <br> 13019469 Latch  <br> 13041737 Bushing, Trigger  <br> 13041738 Trigger Bar  <br> 13041740 Hammer  <br> 13041744 Pin, Barrel Stop  <br> 13041713 Pin, Grooved  <br> 13059446 Latch Buttstock <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br>  12. Question: 13051121 Hook -  <br> 1. Forging Alternative: This part would be a good candidate for a forging. Can USG add note: PART MAY BE FORGED PER AMS6400? <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br> 13. Question: 13051120 Latch  <br> a. Material Sourcing: This is a bent sheet metal part. Thickness of material is 1mm  .04 (.039 quote mark    .0016 quote mark ). Can USG allow a standard US gauge material? Metric material is very difficult to source within US without purchasing mill-run quantities. This will add significant costs to program. Can USG allow US gauge steel 19ga (.042 quote mark  1.067mm) or 20ga (.036 quote mark .914mm). Can USG allow alternate materials such as SAE1008/SAE1010? These are more common steels.  <br>  <br> b.2. Drawing Data: Part width (M104) is 4 +.03mm - 0mm. This is a total tolerance of   .0006 quote mark . Holding this tolerance would require contractor to grind or machine this feature post forming. Can USG open tolerance? Something like 4mm + .5 (+.020 quote mark ) is appropriate for a bent part.  <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br> 14. Question:13057919 Frame, Buttstock  <br> a. Drawing Data: Drawing calls for Weld filler to be ER69-1 (100 ksi filler wire). One of the parts is Mild Steel (DS type B). Using high strength wire to weld very low strength base material seems to serve no purpose. Can USG allow ER70S-6 - ER70S-2 filler rod to be used?  <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br> 15. 13047922 Plate, Buttstock  <br> a.. Drawing Data: This is a formed sheet metal part. Flatness callout after bending .02mm (flat within   .0004 quote mark ). This tolerance would require Contractor to grind or machine post bending. Can USG open tolerance?  <br> 1.) The Symmetry callout for the (M101) 11 +.2 -0 dimension is .02mm ( .0004 quote mark ) this would require an EDM step to accomplish. Can USG use more appropriate tolerance?  <br> 2.) There are no MMC (max material condition) allowances, which would require each part to be located in the EDM and probed for center. Can USG replace symmetry callout with something appropriate?  <br> b. Material Sourcing: Can USG change material thickness to allow domestic (US) 11ga (.1196 quote mark  3.038mm)?  <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br> 16. Question: 13057921 Eyebolt  <br> a. Material Sourcing: No material callout.  <br> b. Drawing Data: M102 diameter 5 +0-.008 ( .00015 quote mark ) Can USG specify more appropriate tolerance?  <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made.  <br>  <br> 17. Question: 13059446 Latch Buttstock <br> a. Casting alternatives: Can USG allow a casting for this part? <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br>  <br> 18. Question:13041697 Receiver  <br> a. Drawing Data:  <br> 1) Unable to find Datum D.  <br> 2) Unable to find callout for threads shown in section F-F, Sheet3 Zone G1. <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made.  <br>  <br> 19. Question: 13041704 Barrel  <br> a. Drawing Data: Note 10, specifies special testing requirement for destructive cross sectioning. The QAP symbol does not include a verification level to determine sampling frequency. Contactor will need Sampling frequency in order to provide an accurate bid. <br>  <br> Answer: The USG is currently reviewing the above and a determination has not been made. <br>  <br> END OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED ON THE DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (DRFP) W15QKN-14-R-0067. <br>    <br>  <br> This is a follow up notification for the Special Notice Posting dated 05_27-2014 for the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) W15QKN-14-R-0067 for acquisition of M320_M320A1 Grenade Launchers.   <br>    <br>  The DRFP W15QKN-14-R-0067 comprises the previous Special Notice posted 05_27_2014 and the attached documents and the M320_M320A1 Grenade Launcher (M320 GL) Technical Data Package (TDP).   <br>    <br>  The M320 GL TDP will be released to your company once the attached NDA, DD Form 2345 and AMSTA-AR Form 1350 have been fully completed by your authorized representative and returned to Catherine John-Angle via email address catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil.    <br>    <br>  The estimated release date of the TDP is 25 Jun 2014 and the response date for comments on the draft RFP is 25 Jul 2014.  <br>      <br>  Previous Special Notice posted 05_27_2014: This is a synopsis notice for  the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) W15QKN-14-R-0067 (DRAFT RFP) for the M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, National Stock Number 1010-01-566-9083(M320 GL) and M320A1 40mm Grenade Launcher, National Stock Number 1010-01-557-2542 (M320 GL).  This announcement is issued for planning purposes only and constitutes a request for exchange of information pursuant to FAR 5.205 Special Situations (c) Special notices and FAR 15.201 Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.  The purpose of exchanging information is to both improve the understanding of United States Government (USG) requirements by industry and knowledge of industry capabilities by the USG.  Potential offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time.   <br>      <br>   The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW), intends to award this requirement as a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders.  The contract will include five ordering periods to cover FY15- FY19 United States Army (US Army) M320 GL requirements and supplemental requirements for Other Agencies.  As future needs for the M320 GL are identified during the life of the contract, FFP delivery orders will be awarded to the IDIQ base contract.  It is anticipated that delivery orders will generally be placed annually.  However, delivery orders may be placed more or less often to accommodate changing needs of the USG Department of Defense.  A minimum of 7,200 M320 GLs and a maximum of 32,413 M320 GLs will be included in the planned IDIQ contract.   <br>   The M320 GL is a 40mm, single shot, grenade launcher that can deliver aimed fire to area targets at a distance of up to 350 meters.  The M320 GL is capable of being utilized in both standalone and M4/M16 mounted configurations. The M320 GL module (M320 GLM) system consists of a grenade launcher, buttstock, leaf sight, M4/M16 mounting hardware, sling, Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Grenadier Sighting System (GSS), when a GSS configuration is determined and GSS are produced. The M320 GL features an aluminum side-pivoting barrel assembly, aluminum receiver, removable buttstock and mounting brackets, along with a polymer pistol grip/trigger guard assembly. The M320 GL will be produced to a USG M320 GL Technical Data Package (TDP).     <br>      <br>   Any offeror(s) awarded a contract resulting from the formal RFP shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) and  Lot Acceptance Test(s).  Awardees will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished rifles, carbines, grenade launchers, 5.56 and 40mm ammunition, and equipment to be considered for award and will have to receive a  quote mark complete award quote mark  rating from their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) under pre-award surveys and be approved by the Defense Security Service to physical security level(s) designated for the weapons and ammunitions manufactured by the contractor or provided by the USG.   <br>   Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions and/or comments to DRAFT RFP prior to the release of a final RFP.  Offerors shall submit questions electronically no later than July 24, 2014, to Therese Grimm at therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil and Catherine John- Angle at catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil.  It is anticipated that interested parties questions submitted in response to this synopsis notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) along with corresponding USG answers.   <br>   Note:  No information exchanged with industry will be considered in the evaluation process.  The only time that an Offeror's information is evaluated for award will be during the pre-award evaluation phase(s) of proposals submitted under the final RFP W15QKN-14-R-0067.  Potential offerors are directed not to submit proposals at this time.   <br>      <br>   The USG has acquired the rights to use the TDP for competitive procurements under a negotiated Special License Agreement (SLA).  Therefore, this TDP is categorized as Distribution D and is restricted to the terms of the SLA. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  This restriction also applies to distribution of the TDP to all subcontractors at every level. When the planned draft RFP and the planned formal RFP are released, only respondents who have a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, Non-Disclosure Non-Use Agreement (NDA), to be executed by an authorized representative of the respondent's firm that respond to this notification or the notice for the final RFP, and DD Form 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement will be granted access to the TDP. Draft drawings will be available on or about June 15, 2014 and provided to a respondent after the respondent meets the requirements set forth in this Synopsis Notice.  At the conclusion of the Final RFP process and upon notification from the USG Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), all respondents in receipt of data covered under the NDA, except to an offeror that may be awarded a contract under the final RFP, will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed.  If an offeror is awarded a contract under the final RFP they will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed at the completion or termination of the contract.   <br>      <br>   Release of a Draft TDP presents the opportunity for industry to provide any comments or concerns identified within the Draft TDP. Specific items for thought are availability of TDP materials, familiarity of processes, and overall TDP completeness. Items which are unclear to industry can be addressed prior to final RFP release. This opportunity will aid in providing industry a more clear understanding of the TDP, along with solicitation requirements, prior to release of the final RFP.    <br>      <br>   This is a special notice only and is for planning purposes only.     <br>      <br>   THIS IS NOT A FINAL RFP AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A FINAL RFP.   <br>      <br>   The points of contact for this action are:   <br>      <br>   Catherine Johnangle, Contract Specialist, Email: Catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil and   <br>   Therese Grimm, Contract Officer, Email: therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil.   <br>      <br>   NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.   <br>      <br>   The Government will accept written questions by Email to therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil and catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil.   <br>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish an effort to cost share, on a 1:1 minimum basis, development of continuous lower energy, emissions and noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals to increase airspace system capacity by reducing significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit or reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the global climate.  The CLEEN program is focused on reducing current levels of aircraft noise, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use, and advancing alternative fuels for aviation use.  The focus of this effort is to: (1) mature previously conceived noise, emissions and fuel burn reduction technologies from Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) of 3-4 to TRLs of 6-7 to enable industry to expedite introduction of these technologies into current and future aircraft and engines, and (2) assess the benefits and advance the development and introduction of alternative "drop in" fuels for aviation, with particular focus on renewable options, including blends.

<DESC>&nbsp; This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capability statements, regarding: <br /><br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br /><br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br /><br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition (339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supply Manufacturing). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code (339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supply Manufacturing) should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice has been posted to establish, provide, and maintain a laboratory animal personnel protective equipment (PPE) resource to ensure the accessibility and availability of essential supplies throughout an emergency/disaster, government shutdown, or any other interruption of regular deliveries. These supplies support irreplaceable multidisciplinary animal research, which is critical to the mission of eight institutes at the National Institutes of Health. This requirement for supplies of a specific quality and quantity meets specific specifications.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The Contract will consist of a base year with four (4) option years. In addition to establishing and maintaining PPE as an emergency and disaster resource, the vendor must provide high quality laboratory PPE that meet the specifications as outlined below. Since PPE products have a definitive shelf life, to maintain the integrity of the stocked items the vendor shall deliver requested items from the reserve to the facility on a routine basis or upon request as outlined below. In addition, the vendor shall reestablish the reserve as directed by the Government on a monthly basis. It is the vendor's responsibility to manage the reserve to ensure the continued rotation of product to protect the integrity of the resource.</p>
<p>Project requirements:</p>
<p>Therefore, the vendor must be able to supply the following goods or services:</p>
<p>1. Provide PPE products identical or equivalent to Life Science SMS Lab Coats, Polypropylene Coveralls, SMS Coveralls, Suntech Microporous Film Coveralls, the Non-Skid/Water Resistant shoe covers, Guardian Nitrile Gloves, and Rhino Shield Latex Medical Grade Gloves. PPE items may be added, subtracted, or otherwise modified at the discretion of the Government to meet evolving program requirements;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ensure that the lab coats and coveralls meet the sizing specifications, salient characteristics and physical properties as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Ensure that the gloves meet the salient characteristic as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Provide a specialized temperature, humidity, and vermin controlled storage/warehouse, as outlined below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Provide routine deliveries to our research facility. Deliveries will be made Monday through Friday from 7:30 AM to 3:00 PM (excluding Federal Holidays);</p>
<p>6. Provide emergency deliveries and services in the event of an emergency or disaster;</p>
<p>7. Ensure that the integrity of the products is maintained throughout storage and delivery. This includes, but is not limited to, protection from moisture and dust which may carry unwanted pathogens;</p>
<p>8. Ensure that less than five percent (&lt;5%) of boxes/items are torn, ripped, or damaged upon delivery; to include faulty zippers within the coveralls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Provide a credit/replacement, at the contractor's expense, for all broken, torn, ripped, or damaged PPE items;</p>
<p>10. Provide return trips to correct an incorrect product delivery/order or replace damaged items within 24 hours of the original required delivery date and time;&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Unload pallets from the delivery truck and place them on the designated animal facility loading dock;</p>
<p>12. Maintain current and accurate product inventory details and controls to ensure the rotation of stock, timely dating, and delivery;</p>
<p>13. Supply a copy of the current inventory, including inventory numbers of each product by manufacturer and production dates, to the COTR on a monthly basis, at the end of each month, or upon request;</p>
<p>14. Provide an Operations Statement which includes the vendors program for maintaining the integrity of the stored and delivered products, as well as product rotation and inventory programs; and</p>
<p>15. Provide a Disaster Plan to include how the contractor shall ensure the provision of services and transportation of required supplies in the event of an emergency or disaster.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:</p>
<p>To Be Determined</p>
<br />
<p>Other important considerations:</p>
<p><br />1. Coupled with the potential for prolonged manufacturing times and a definitive product shelf life, underscores the critical need for this contract. It is the goal of this contract to establish a stable, cost effective, mechanism to ensure the immediate accessibility of up to a ninety (90) day supply of material, as well as provide for the availability of material for rotation and replacement throughout the twelve (12) month contract period. The initial emergency/disaster reserve volume of all PPE will be determined at the time of award. The reserve volume for each category and product will be subsequently adjusted on a monthly basis in accordance with available resources and program requirements.</p>
<p>2. The Building 49 Central Animal Facility (CAF) located on the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health contributes to the advancement of biomedical research by providing professional and technical support services related to laboratory animal care and use, and housing laboratory animals in support of eight institute's intramural research program. In order to support our animals and the critical research programs they represent, we must ensure consistent supply PPE materials, even during emergency and disaster situations. Due to the critical nature of these supplies our program requirements have been incorporated into both our Facility and Institute disaster preparedness plans.</p>
<p>3. The value of disaster preparedness to laboratory animal facilities has been highlighted in recent years, because of several large scale disasters that have impacted the U.S. research investment. Disaster preparedness in the workplace seeks to reduce direct and indirect losses resulting from disasters. Losses are smallest when the disruptions to animal care and research are minimized. During emergency/disaster events, the normal supply and distribution channels will most likely be unavailable/or protracted due to the impact of the emergency and the rush of immediate orders. Our program's disaster plan takes these factors into account; it is therefore our intention is to establish an offsite source of critical supplies with an established, laboratory animal PPE vendor with a proven track record of providing quality products and services. As outlined in our emergency plan it is the intention of our program to be able to house up to a one year's supply of PPE products with a local vendor within a 90 mile radius of NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. The ideal vendor will need a strong disaster plan and have arrangements made with the state and federal agencies in the event of an emergency and or disaster to be able to arranged deliveries to the NIH. As a secondary backup, in the event that the vendor is not able to transport the required supplies we will work with the local vendor to directly pick up the required items.</p>
<p>4. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) defines animal biosecurity as "all measures taken to identify, contain, prevent and eradicate known or unknown infections that may cause clinical disease or alter physiologic and behavioral responses or otherwise make the animals unsuitable for research". The National Animal Health Emergency Management System Guidelines define biosecurity for animal production facilities similarly as "a series of management practices designed to prevent the introduction of and spread of disease agents." Therefore, as part of our program's "Biosecurity Program" we must ensure the provision of an uninterrupted supply of essential supplies, this plan is a shared responsibility between our program and the selected vendor to ensure the consistent availability of high quality PPE products and services.</p>
<p>5. The Vendor's warehouse is required to have adequate, vermin free, space available for the storage of up to a year's supply of PPE. The supplies will be stored in an area that is protected from the risk of contamination from animal pathogens, toxic and or hazardous substances. Ideally, the product shall also be protected from dust which may carry or harbor pathogens. The warehouse shall have a pest control program designed to prevent, control or eliminate the presence of or infestation by pests. The Vendor must provide the name of the firm that provides vermin and pest control services as well as a description of their pest control program. A regularly scheduled and documented program of control and monitoring should exist. The Vendor also must provide documentation with regard to their quality assurance practices. All products supplied should be free of chemical or pathologic contaminants and the presence of natural toxicants. Areas used for storage should not be subject to elevated temperatures or elevated relative humidity for prolonged periods of time as outlined below. The Vendor must provide information on manufacturing, monitoring, and storage of PPE products, as well as quality assurance results on a monthly basis. As part of our programs' responsibility, we will inspect the site(s) annually to ensure that they are meeting the above requirements.</p>
<p>6. It is our intent to incorporate within the contract the ability to secure space within the suppliers' warehouse(s) that meets the biosecurity requirements listed above. As part of the agreement, we would meet with the vendor prior to award and once a year thereafter for a site visit of the warehouse to ensure that the stated requirements outlined in this statement of work are met or exceeded. This will ensure that the facility is able to maintain up to a year's reserve of PPE products at the respective location, as well as the vendor's ability to meet or exceed the requirement of this SOW. This vendor would be required to provide a detailed inventory list on a monthly basis, or more often if needed, and document that the reserve stock is being rotated to ensure the integrity of all products.</p>
<p>7. All PPE clothing and equipment should be of safe design and construction, and should be maintained in a clean and reliable fashion. The Government has taken the usability and fit of the proposed PPE into consideration with the specifications outlined in this RFP. The specifications are based on the requirements that the PPE fits well and is comfortable to wear. This encourages both our staff and researchers to use the PPE. The PPE specifications are available in multiple sizes and care should be taken to ensure that they meet the specifications so that the proper size for each employee is met. It is not uncommon for several different types of PPE to be worn together; the specifications found within the RFP ensure the compatibility of the different PPE. If PPE does not fit properly, it can make the difference between being safely covered or dangerously exposed. Ill-fitting PPE will fail to provide the required level of protection for the staff and the animals, as well as discouraging appropriate use.</p>
<p>8. The distinction between exam gloves proposed within the RFP and general purpose gloves needs to be clarified. Exam grade gloves are different from general purpose gloves in that they must meet a series of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in order to be marketed as exam grade gloves and are acceptable for use by doctors, dentists, labs or any other application requiring a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. Exam gloves are regulated by stringent FDA requirements requiring specific production and quality control standards. General purpose gloves are for use in food service, industrial or any other application that does not require a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. This is the most common glove found in the marketplace and popular uses include food service, packaging, automotive, painting and health &amp; beauty. For this RFP only Medical-Grade gloves will be used and must meet the FDA Acceptable Quality level. This is a quality specification that manufacturers, as well as the FDA use to specify the pinhole rate in medical examination gloves. FDA standards specify an AQL of 2.5 for the medical examination gloves. This means that the defect level from a large number of gloves will not exceed 2.5%. The tensile strength of a glove is the measurement of the amount of force or pull required to break any glove. The length and thickness (Mil) is defined within the salient characteristic of each glove listed in the RFP.</p>
<p>9. Samples of each item will be specifically requested as part of any future proposal. Samples are to be furnished free of charge. Samples can be returned at an prospective vendor's request, provided that the vendor pay for the transportation costs.</p>
<p>Standards:<br />&bull; National Research Council (2011). Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition. Pages 21, 22, 141. Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences</p>
<p><br />&bull; National Institute of Health, Animal Research Advisory Committee Guidelines for Personnel Protection in Animal Facilities</p>
<p><br />&bull; OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The proposed PPE must meet the cited ANSI standard. PPE stocks must meet the ANSI standard in effect at the time of its manufacture or provide protection equivalent to PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. OSHA requires PPE to meet the following ANSI standards:</p>
<p>o Eye and Face Protection: ANSI Z87.1-1989 (USA Standard for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection).<br />o Head Protection: ANSI Z89.1-1986.<br />o Foot Protection: ANSI Z41.1-1991.<br />o For hand protection, there is no ANSI standard for gloves but OSHA recommends that selection be based upon the tasks to be performed and the performance and construction characteristics of the glove material. For protection against chemicals, glove selection must be based on the chemicals encountered, the chemical resistance and the physical properties of the glove material.</p>

<DESC>RFI Amendment 01 - Army Dental Command (DENCOM) Dental Services <br>  <br> This Amendment is being posted to make you aware of changes that have occurred since the initial posting of this RFI for Dental Services.  In our initial RFI dated 24 JAN 14, it was stated that three contracts would be awarded for each of the three regions (1) Northern Regional Dental Command (RDC); (2) Southern RDC; and (3) Western RDC and Pacific RDC.  DENCOM is currently in a reorganization of its command and they will no longer be divided into the three regions.  The DENCOM Dental Services contract will now be comprised of two regions which are: Region 1-Central/Pacific Regional Dental Command and Region 2-Eastern Regional Dental Command.  As a result, the scope of work for each of these two new regions has increased and we must determine if there are still small businesses interested and capable of competing for these two new regions, considering the larger scope of work for each of these regions. <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication that CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future Solicitation. <br>  <br> As a recap, the Government's requirement is to obtain a personal services contract to provide dental services to eligible beneficiaries of the military health care system in support of the Army Dental Command (DENCOM) for performance within the Continental United States (CONUS) to include Alaska and Hawaii.  These services are to be performed by doctors in the disciplines of General Dentistry, Endodontists, and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.  Ancillary support includes Dental Hygienists, Dental Assistants, Dental Therapy Assistants, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Dental Assistants, Dental Laboratory Technicians, Porcelain Ceramists Laboratory Technicians, and Dental Ceramo-Metal Laboratory Technicians.  Health Care Providers (HCPs) will work under the control and general supervision of the DENTAC Commander and/or Officer-in-Charge of the Dental Clinic, or his or her representative.  This requirement is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity task order type contract with composite burdened labor rate pricing on a Fixed Priced basis.  This will result in the award of two (2) separate regional contracts consisting of performance in the following regions:  Region 1-Central/Pacific Regional Dental Command (two RDC's combined) and Region 2-Eastern Regional Dental Command (see Exhibit C, DENCOM Clinic Locations).  When a solicitation is issued, offerors will have the opportunity to propose on one or both regions.  Composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> This personal services requirement is intended to create an employer-employee relationship between the Government and the individual contract Health Care Providers (HCPs) only to the extent necessary for providing the dental services required under this contract.  The performance of dental services by the individual contract HCPs are subject to the same day-to-day supervision and control by health care facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service HCPs engaged in the delivery of comparable dental services.  The contract HCPs shall work under the direction and general supervision of the Dental Activity (DENTAC) Commander or his Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Dental Clinic.  All persons performing work under the contract shall be and shall remain employees of the contractor and are not employees of the Government.  A  quote mark draft quote mark  Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) that might result from this survey would have a period of performance of a base period (9-months) and 4 one-year options.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 621210 and the small business size standard is $7.5M.  <br>  <br> The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the Army DENCOM requirements.  We recommend that you first review the  quote mark draft quote mark  PWS so that you may have a better insight on the questions below. <br>  <br> 1.  Would your company be interested in pursuing a Government contract for one or both of the following regions:  Region 1-Central/Pacific Regional Dental Command and Region 2-Eastern Regional Dental Command. (see Attachment 2 Estimated FTEs and DENCOM Locations within each region.) <br>  <br> 2.  Can a single composite rate be developed for each labor category to cover pricing for the geographically dispersed locations within each of the 2 regional contracts (see Attachment 1 - PWS, Attachment 2 - Estimated FTEs and DENCOM Locations)?  Note:  For the combined Central and Pacific RDCs, composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> 3.  If you are considered a large business, is there a possibility you may contemplate teaming with a small business for this requirement?   <br>  <br> 4.  If you are a small business, please explain how you will successfully qualify to compete on this acquisition (Teaming arrangement, Joint venture, etc.).  Also specify your small business status (small business, 8(a), woman owned, SDVOSB, etc). <br>  <br> 5.  Does your company currently possess adequate staffing or have the capability to support one or all of the regions that you are interested in with the required labor categories?  If so, please describe your staffing capabilities. <br>  <br> 6.  Discuss any concerns, comments or recommendations you may have with the attached  quote mark draft quote mark  PWS or any related Attachments/Exhibits.  Please reference the applicable PWS paragraph numbers with each comment. <br>  <br> Responses should contain your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 621210 (size standard $7,500,000).

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">2. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-font-kerning: 12.0pt">The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has used the SMAW since 1984. The existing SMAW system is comprised of a reusable launcher and a family of rockets. Currently, the launcher is comprised of a 9mm Spotting rifle, a firing mechanism, a launch tube assembly and an unpowered day optic. Each rocket comes with a magazine of "ballistically-matched" spotting cartridges that aid in ranging to the target. To operate the weapon, the gunner loads the magazine in the spotting rifle and the rocket in the rear of the launcher. The gunner fires the spotting cartridges, "walking" the bullets by adjusting launcher elevation and azimuth until the range to the target has been determined. At that time, the gunner launches the rocket.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-font-kerning: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Additionally, using the spotting rifle increases system maintenance burdens, thereby contributing to the system's lower-than-expected level of readiness. Overall, the ranging and targeting system is outdated, adds undue weight, and provides suboptimal ranging accuracy. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-font-kerning: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Instead, the USMC intends to modify the SMAW launcher's existing alternate targeting and ranging system components (in lieu of the spotting rifle and day optic). The targeting and ranging systems shall be comprised of an integrated Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS) and Laser Range Finder (LRF), making the launcher lighter, more accurate, quicker to employ, and easier to maintain.</span></p>

Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. 
Purchase Request Number 554-15-1-450-0021.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
This justification is for a firm fixed price sole source procurement for preventive maintenance (PM) on two XL72 Ultrasonic Cleaners.  The manufacturer and authorized PM service provider is Ultra Clean Systems, Inc., 148 Dunbar Ave, Suite A, Oldsmar, FL  34677. The PM services are for Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS) to be provided at Denver VAMC, 1055 Clermont St, Denver, CO 80220. PM services are required for a base year and 3 option years for a total value of $91,508.24. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 
Preventive maintenance services are required on two XL72 Ultrasonic Cleaners for ECHCS.  Only Ultra Clean Systems, Inc. can provide this service. The service contract covers four PM service checks annually, and any unscheduled repairs and parts for each system.  ECHCS requires service from 1 November 2014 through 31 October 2015 and option years through 2019.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC Â§253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302.1  

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability

	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  
The contractor, Ultra Clean Systems, Inc. is the manufacture of the XL72 Ultrasonic Cleaner.  It is the sole vendor that can provide service, repair, OEM parts, and software updates to the equipment as need.  Ultra Clean Systems only authorizes its certified technicians to perform maintenance and repairs to keep systems certified and operational.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 
None
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Market research was conducted through Government contract directory, VETBIZ, Small Business Administration Dynamic search, and GSA eLibrary. No other vendors were found to provide this PM service to meet ECHS requirements.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:
None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
As new equipment is needed in the future ECHCS will conduct market research for new systems.  Procurement of these systems will be conducted on a competitive basis.   The contracting officer will also conduct independent market research to identify potential sources that can satisfy requirements.
