<DESC>This synopsis is to announce that the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (ALC), Robins AFB, GA, intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, engineering services to perform an intensive investigation, testing, evaluation, and finding of root causes leading to several failure incidents produced by the MAU-46 Bomb Ejector Rack.

NSLS-II INFORMATION
Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking interested General Contractors for the construction of conventional facilities for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) project, which is to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY 11973.

The NSLS-II will be an advanced, highly optimized third generation medium energy storage ring with full injection for top-off mode operation.  The X-ray brightness and flux of NSLS-II will be world leading, exceeding that of any other currently existing or under construction.  It will be 10,000 times brighter and have 10 times higher flux than the present NSLS.  NSLS-II will meet the nations need for a high brightness, medium energy X-ray source. It will enable structural studies of the smallest crystals in structural biology, provide a wide range of nanometer resolution probes for Nanoscience, enable coherent beam scattering studies of the dynamics of condensed matter systems, and enable new methods for imaging the structure of disordered materials and biological systems.

The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 383,000 square feet.  Additional small utility buildings may be required depending, on the ultimate design of utility systems.  

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of NSLS-II and will house the operations center, department offices, offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, the experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities.  

The proposed construction type for each building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior.  Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin, or membrane roof systems.  

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces.  Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines.  The NSLS-II project building is designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces.  Additionally, the building design minimizes EMI and RFI fields in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment.   There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline, and certain laboratory spaces that will require HVAC system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

The estimated value of conventional construction ranges between $180,000,000 and $200,000,000.

Description of Requirement

The Library of Congress has been generating the annual 7,000+ page 5-volume Subject Headings using a series of mainframe-based programs that have been in place since the 1970s. The last step of this series of programs is the creation of what is called a Videocomp Driver which is then written to magnetic tape. This tape was formerly sent to the Government Printing Office (GPO) for processing on GPOs Videocomp* typesetting machine. The Videocomp at GPO had been specially programmed to include customized fonts necessary to typeset the extensive and complex diacritical marks required by the Subject Headings.  Videocomp was retired and the Library of Congress now needs to find another methodology to produce the Subject Headings.

In addition, the Library of Congress also retired their in-house mainframe system and the software would need to be entirely rewritten if the Subject Headings were still to be produced.  The Library of Congress subsequently replaced their mainframe system with an XML-based workflow drawn directly from the MARC records when this rewrite became necessary.    

The Library of Congress is searching for an organization with a 1970s-era Videocomp typesetting machine with the appropriate font configuration or can offer an alternate solution.    

Bidders should know that the meaning of some of the code sequences in the data stream are context-dependent, i.e. the same code sequence in the input data may have several different meanings depending on where it appears in the coding hierarchy. For this reason, simple lookup and replace methodologies cannot correctly convert the data stream and the conversion program must be aware of the context in which a string appears in order to process it correctly. 

As noted above, the data includes a variety of diacritics: grave, acute, circumflex, tilde, macron, underscore, breve, superior dot, dot below, umlaut, hacek, circle above, double acute, cedilla (accent and not just the character), right hook, double dot below, circle below, double underscore, left hook, right cedilla and tilde spanning multiple characters. In addition to the standard accents outlined above, the fonts must support a variety of accents that are relatively rare such as the pseudo question mark, upadhmaniya, cantrabindu, high comma off-center, and high comma centered.

The solution must offer a high-speed batch composition system that directly processes the XML and outputs PDF files.  The system must properly handle all the Unicode characters and accents, embeds all necessary fonts, and automatically creates the multi-level continuation headings.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to procure the production of fourteen (14) Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) sets, thirteen (13) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) 4.0.1 sets, and multiple configurations of equipment upgraded as part of Aegis Modernization (AMOD), to address the requirements of Fiscal Years (FYs) 2009 through 2013, from Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (Lockheed Martin MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey.
MMSP equipment sets will be procured for three (3) sites (the Combat System Engineering Development Site (CSEDS), Aegis Training and Readiness Center (ATRC), and Surface Combat Systems Center (SCSC)), and eleven (11) ships, for a total of fourteen (14) sets.  MMSP consolidates the BMD performance requirements and the SPY-1D(V) radar signal processor functionality into a single set of enclosures.  The production lead time for MMSP equipment is twenty-two (22) months, requiring a production start date of February 2009 in order to ensure that deliveries to the Aegis sites occur in FY 2011, to support fleet installation beginning in FY 2012.
The BMD 4.0.1 equipment sets will be procured for one (1) site (ATRC) and twelve (12) ships, for a total of thirteen (13) sets.  The BMD 4.0.1 equipment set consists of the BMD 4.0.1 signal processor, the BMD computing suite, and the Kill Assessment System, and six additional technical refresh kits with spares.  The BMD 4.0.1 signal processor, developed by Lockheed Martin MS2 under contract N00024-03-C-6110 as part of the BMD 4.0.1 combat system, is critical to the design configuration and production of MMSP, which is necessary to support the schedule for AMOD.  The production lead time for BMD 4.0.1 equipment is twenty-four (24) months, and deliveries begin in FY 2011.
AMOD upgrade equipment is required for three (3) sites (SCSC, ATRC, and the Integrated Warfare Systems Laboratory (IWSL)), and twenty-three (23) ships, for a total of twenty-six (26) equipment sets.  The upgrades will ensure that the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) interfaces properly with the additional capabilities provided by MMSP and the BMD 4.0.1 combat system  The production lead time for AWS support equipment is thirteen (13) months, and deliveries begin in FY 2010.
Under separate contracts, Lockheed Martin MS2 is concurrently designing the specification and configuration upgrades for MMSP, BMD 4.0.1, and AMOD equipment.  Lockheed Martin MS2 is the prime contractor for both MMSP and BMD 4.0.1 development efforts under a contract with MDA (N00024-03-C-6110).  Lockheed Martin MS2 also is the prime contractor for the AWS and is currently designing the modifications and configuration changes to the AMOD upgrade equipment under contract N00024-03-C-5115.  Due to the complexity of the AWS, a contractor must have intimate knowledge of all system requirements, weapon specifications, equipment design, and interfaces in order to produce, field, and test production units initially, prior to validation of production designs.  The government will not obtain a level III technical data package, sufficient to conduct a competitive procurement to meet the requirements of FYs 2009 through 2013, for MMSP, BMD 4.0.1, or AMOD upgrade equipment.  Accordingly, NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only known source containing the requisite knowledge and the only firm capable of meeting the Navys technical requirements within the schedule for fielding AMOD capability.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for a base year (Fiscal Year (FY) 2009) and three one-year options (FYs 2010 through 2012), to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (Lockheed Martin MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey, for Platform System Engineering Agent (PSEA) efforts associated with the Aegis Weapon System (AWS)..  The AWS is the automated segment of the Aegis Combat System (ACS), which will satisfy the anti-air-warfare and ballistic-missile-defense (BMD) mission requirements on Aegis cruisers and destroyers (CG-47 and DDG-51 Class ships).  Lockheed Martin MS2 developed and produced the AWS.  The proposed contract will provide for software integration and hardware upgrades necessary to integrate additional war-fighting capabilities with the AWS.  These integration efforts are essential in order to satisfy initial installation on CG-62 and DDG-53 in 2012.  The contract also will provide for maintenance of the AWS computer program in support of Cruiser Modernization (CG Mod), the in-service fleet and new-construction destroyers.  
As the PSEA, Lockheed Martin MS2 will perform the integration, testing and certification of software upgrades addressed in Aegis Modernization (AMOD) Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, and hardware upgrades addressed in Technical Insertion (TI) 12.  The additional weapon systems and capabilities to be integrated with AWS in ACB 12 and TI 12, to create a Family of Systems (FoS), include: (a) Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA); (b) Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP); (c) the Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP); (d) BMD; and (e) Standard Missile 6 (SM-6).  All of these parallel efforts, which are currently under development, must merge in order to support testing in FY 2010 and initial installation in FY 2012.  
In addition, Lockheed Martin MS2 will provide continuing computer program and other post-delivery support for CG Mod ships (CG-52 through CG-58) and the new-construction destroyers that incorporate Baseline 7.1R of the AWS computer program (DDG-103 through DDG-112).  The contractor will also provide White Sands Missile Range computer program upgrades to support AMOD development, and will conduct ACB studies and analyses for future Aegis improvements. 
NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as LM MS2 is the only known source containing the requisite knowledge to support the Aegis program schedule(s) without introducing unacceptable delays and incurring duplication of costs.   Lockheed Martin MS2 has the highly technical and specialized knowledge of the Ships mission, design, combat systems and the associated software that is required for the design, test, certification and validation of these critical mission computer programs.  Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only contractor that possesses the experience, knowledge, technical expertise, integration and testing capabilities and facilities necessary to perform these requirements to ensure the Navys fleet critical operational commitments are met. Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only company that can meet the Navys requirement to concurrently upgrade the existing AWS software and complete the initial installation of a fully integrated FoS on Aegis cruisers and destroyers in 2012.  This effort requires the concurrent development and integration of highly complex, additional war-fighting capabilities, and the host AWS software, which together make up the FoS.
Given that Lockheed Martin MS2 must perform the integration of ACB 12 and TI 12, Lockheed Martin MS2 also must perform the computer program maintenance necessary to support CG Mod, new-construction DDGs, and the in-service fleet.  As the original developer of the 5.3, 6.1, 6.3, 7.1, and 7.1R AWS software baselines,  Lockheed Martin MS2 is also the only vendor with the detailed technical and historical experience to provide this type of operational unit and software maintenance support.    .
Lockheed Martin MS2 is also uniquely qualified to procure, modify and install the PSEA-related hardware. The equipment to be procured will be installed and integrated with other equipment owned by the government and Lockheed Martin MS2, located at the governments Combat Systems Engineering Development Site and Lockheed Martins facilities.  The required hardware is unique to each site, and the procurement, installation and maintenance of that hardware requires an understanding of the existing site layout and equipment.  The contractor will design the hardware concurrently with the development of ACB 12.  Thus, no other source can satisfy this requirement in time to support ACB 12s test and delivery schedules.      

Notice: See Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract to Lockheed Martin, Maritime Systems and Sensors, (LM MS2) 199 Borton Landing Road Moorestown NJ 08057-0297.  This contract will be for the Aegis development associated with Aegis Modernization (AMOD) Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12 (software upgrades) and Technical Insertion (TI) 12 (hardware upgrades), including a base year (Fiscal Year (FY) 2009) and three one-year options (FYs 2010 through 2012).  AMOD is an upgrade to the Aegis Weapon System (AWS)  the automated segment of the Aegis Combat System (ACS), which will satisfy the anti-air-warfare and ballistic-missile-defense (BMD) mission requirements on Aegis cruisers and destroyers (CG-47 and DDG-51 Class ships).  Lockheed Martin MS2 developed and produced the AWS.  The proposed contract will provide for software upgrades, hardware integration, and Navy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) engineering support.
As the AMOD capability developer, Lockheed Martin MS2 will base DDG Modernization on the Aegis Cruiser Modernization (CG Mod) ACB 08 computer program and, in parallel with the CG/DDG Platform Systems Engineering Agent (PSEA), will integrate the software into a deliverable system. Under the AMOD development contract, Lockheed Martin MS2 will be responsible for changes to the core AWS software that relate to the integration of highly complex war-fighting improvements, which also are in varying stages of development:  (a) NIFC-CA; (b) Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP); (c) the Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP); (d) BMD; and (e) Standard Missile 6 (SM-6).  These improvements must operate as a Family of Systems (FoS).  Lockheed Martin MS2 also will establish a modular architecture, at the component level, for the affected parts of the existing AWS software, and port where necessary to facilitate the integration of these new war-fighting improvements and to allow for the introduction of future capabilities through the Rapid Capability Insertion Process.  Finally, Lockheed Martin MS2 will provide engineering support to refine the implementation of NIFC-CA in AMOD.  All of these concurrent efforts must merge in order to support testing, and to meet the schedule for initial installation on CG-62 and DDG-53 in FY 2012.
NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only company that can meet the Navys requirement to upgrade the existing AWS software and complete the initial installation of a fully integrated FoS on Aegis cruisers and destroyers in 2012.  Modification of the core AWS software, under the proposed contract, is one facet of the concurrent development and integration of the highly complex elements that make up the FoS.  Each change within the existing AWS code must be made in parallel with the other changes and integration efforts.  Given the challenges associated with concurrent software development, Lockheed Martin MS2 is uniquely capable of performing the work in a coordinated fashion and in accordance with strict schedule constraints.
Notice: See Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a base year  contract (FY 2009) with three one-year option periods (FY 2010-FY 2012), to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (Lockheed Martin MS2), in Moorestown, NJ, for technical engineering support and related operation and maintenance of the Combat Systems Engineering Development Site (CSEDS) (a government-owned, contractor-operated facility), and technical engineering support for the SPY 1A Test Lab and Naval Systems Computing Center (NSCC) (a set of contractor-owned facilities that consists of: (1) the Computer Program Test Site, Program Generation Center; (2) the Combat System Engineering Test Center; (3) the Theater Network Integration Center; (4) the Back-Fit Program Test Facility; and (5) the Aegis Data Reduction Center).  
	The contractor will provide continuing technical engineering support, configuration management, quality assurance, operation and maintenance for CSEDS, as well as continued technical engineering support for those integrated facilities owned and operated by Lockheed Martin MS2.  These facilities (also referred to as the Aegis sites) incorporate highly integrated, classified, real-time networks that connect numerous contractor and U.S. Government facilities required to build, integrate, and deliver computer code.  The facilities support all Aegis in-service capabilities, Aegis Modernization (AMOD), Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) efforts.  The Aegis facilities are required to provide the systems engineering, logistics, quality assurance, configuration management and administrative support to assist in the development, integration and tests of the above efforts.  
	Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), award of the sites contract to LM MS2 without full and open competition is hereby justified, because LM MS2 is the only firm capable of meeting the Navys requirements.   Competition for these efforts would result in unacceptable delays and costs to the AMOD, BMD and FMS programs, and could compromise the effectiveness and reliability of AWS and the other capabilities to be integrated under AMOD.  Dual sourcing these requirements would cost the Government significant duplication of costs.  LM MS2 is the only source capable of meeting these diverse requirements without introducing unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of costs.   	In support of the AMOD developer and PSEA, the sites contractor will have to design the facility combat information control room, computer room layout, and switching for Aegis Combat System interconnections required to support each configuration of ship platform, layout and build cabling, establish facility power requirements and cooling requirements, and ensure that Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) is received, inspected and moved to each site.  The contractor must be experienced in major AWS installation to establish schedules. The schedules must meet each AMOD testing and validation requirement to integrate, test and validate BMD, MMSP, NIFC-CA, SIAP, SM-6 with initial installation in 2012, and in-service and new construction baseline capabilities as part of the Aegis Weapon System.  
To provide test support for AMOD, the in-service fleet, new-construction DDGs, BMD, JBMD, and FMS programs, the sites contractor must have a working knowledge of each shipboard configuration required to support the specific baseline test effort, the site switching system layout and operation, and communication systems at each facility.  The contractor must schedule testing based on non-conflicting equipment configurations, computer suite requirements, and display suites required to conduct each test.  The contractor must be knowledgeable of the computer programs and ship configuration necessary to support each test and be able to meet the testing requirements of each configurations within a short time frame (approximately 10-15 minutes) to minimize baseline scheduled test time.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for a base year (Fiscal Year (FY) 2008) and four one-year options (FY 2009 through FY 2012) to Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon IDS), San Diego, CA, for the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), to perform the responsibilities of the Platform Systems Engineering Agent (PSEA) as described below.  SSDS is the Combat Direction System element for CVN/Amphibious ship combat systems, which will satisfy the anti-air-warfare, anti-ship-missile-defense and other multi-warfare mission requirements on SSDS Carriers and amphibious ships (including CVN 68 class, CVN 78 class, LPD 17 class, LSD 41 class, LSD 49 class, LHD 7, LHD 8, and LHA 6 ships).  The contract will provide for software integration and hardware upgrades necessary to integrate other war-fighting capabilities with SSDS, and for the maintenance of the SSDS computer programs, equipment and documentation.
As the PSEA, Raytheon IDS will perform CVN/Amphibious Modernization Advanced Capability Build 12 / Technical Insertion 12 (ACB12/TI12) integration, testing and certification support.  Raytheon IDS, under the PSEA contract, will be responsible for the integration of highly complex war-fighting improvements into the modular SSDS.  This entails SSDS hardware and software modifications, including modifications to implement the CVN 78 Dual Band Radar for integration into the CVN 78 combat system configuration.  Raytheon IDS will integrate, test and provide certification support for the government-furnished equipment/government-furnished information required for the CVN/Amphibious ship combat system. The new capabilities will be incorporated into the SSDS single-source software component library for re-use across multiple ship classes.  In addition, Raytheon IDS will provide continuing SSDS computer program development, maintenance and other post-delivery support for CVN/Amphibious ships in fielding the SSDS MK 2 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE).  The PSEAs responsibilities also include supporting Navy design systems engineering efforts to determine SSDS modifications to address new warfighting requirements. 

Raytheon IDS is the only company that can meet the Navys requirement for fielding a certified SSDS MK 2 OACE system on USS Nimitz (CVN 68) and other CVN/Amphibious ships over the next five years.  Raytheon IDS, as the SSDS design agent, is currently completing the SSDS MK 2 migration to the OACE, including the integration of tactical software and the production of hardware for fielding on USS NIMITZ (CVN 68) in FY 2009.  The SSDS PSEA will be required to take that software and hardware capability, make adaptations, and conduct further testing and certification for nineteen (19) other CVN/Amphibious ships programmed for SSDS OACE installations in the next five years.  Combat system upgrades with SSDS OACE for the next ship, LPD 17 (USS SAN ANTONIO), are planned to begin in June 2009, and will be followed by CVN 76 (USS RONALD REAGAN) in November 2009, and SSDS OACE deliveries in FY 2010 for the new-construction LPD 24 and LHA 6.  This fielding plan is aggressive, and demands an intricate command of the SSDS.  The introduction of another contractor at this stage would result in adverse impacts on the operation of the fleet and unacceptable schedule delays, including delays in the certification of the integrated combat system software on LPD 17 and CVN 76, and the construction schedules for LPD 24 and LHA 6.  Fifteen (15) more SSDS OACE ship schedules (approximately four ships per year through FY 2012) would be jeopardized by the introduction of a new contractor.


NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as Raytheon IDS is the only known source with the requisite knowledge to support the SSDS program schedule(s) without introducing unacceptable delays and incurring duplication of costs.  Raytheon IDS has the experience and has retained the requisite staff experienced in each of the previous baselines to understand the system, to provide support for fielded systems and to integrate new CVN/Amphibious capabilities for CVN 78 and ACB12/TI12.  Without this SSDS experienced support the Government will not be able to adequately respond to combat system problems in the Fleet and CVN/Amphibious ship construction and modernization schedules. 	Notice: See Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This synopsis informs interested parties that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to procure the production of SSDS  OACE tactical shipsets  comprising eleven (11) SSDS MK 2 Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) kits for LPD, CVN and LHD ships and sites, and nine (9) SSDS MK 1 P3I kits for LSD platforms in accordance with approved Configuration Item Development Specifications (CIDs) to satisfy FY 2009 through FY 2013 requirements from Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, (IDS), San Diego, CA.   The kits include: processors, converters, network devices and interface units. 
SSDS MK 2 kits will be procured for two (2) shore sites and nine (9) ships for a total of eleven (11) kits.  SSDS MK 1 kits will be procured for two (2) shore site and seven (7) ships for a total of nine (9) sets (kits).   The equipment sets consolidates the computing and interface requirements for the SSDS ship class variants. The production lead time for the SSDS equipment is twelve (12) months, requiring a production start date of January 2009 in order to meet the LPD 18 SSDS MK 2 Open Architecture (OA) upgrade deliveries commencing in January 2010. In addition, SSDS MK 1 kit deliveries must commence in January 2011 in order to meet LSD Class production schedules.    Raytheon IDS is currently designing the Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) kits for SSDS MK 1 under contract N00024-05-C-5110.  Additionally, under the same contract, Raytheon IDS will commence engineering in FY 2009 to incorporate design changes to the P3I kits for SSDS MK 2 to incorporate the Common Display System (CDS), Common Processor System (CPS) and other Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technical insertion hardware changes to the SSDS system.  Given these ongoing design changes to the SSDS system, a level III technical data package (TDP) suitable for competition for the production of SSDS MK 1 and SSDS MK 2 P3I kits will not be available to meet the requirements of FY 2009 through FY 2013. Due to the complexity of the SSDS, a contractor must have intimate knowledge of all system requirements, environmental requirements, weapon specifications, equipment design, and interfaces in order to initially produce, field, and test production units prior to validation of production designs. 
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), an award to Raytheon IDS without full and open competition is justified because Raytheon IDS is the only firm capable of meeting the Navys requirements.   
Notice: See Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>General Services Administration's (GSA) Greater Southwest Region has a need for electric power to operate its federal government owned and occupied buildings located within deregulated areas of the Texas ERCOT marketplace. Buildings are located in the TXU, Reliant, CPL and WTU (lines and wires) transmission and delivery service delivery areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GSA is seeking cost effective proposals providing mostly <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">renewable wind generated</strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">electrical energy</strong> to be delivered to GSA facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful offeror will supply electricity and transmission for various contract terms of 36, 60 or 120 monthly billing cycles generally beginning with the next available meter read after contract award, the current contract expires July 31, 2008. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The approximate one (1) year electric requirement is 134,000,000 kWh. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A presolicitation notice was issued February 8, 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government is seeking a fixed price flat rate contract for an optimal term of ten years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will also request pricing for 3 year and 5 years terms in the alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the volatility of fuel costs and electricity prices, and the difficulty of determining where natural gas and other generation fuel markets are headed GSA requires stable supply and pricing. GSA has decided to address these issues by procurement of reliable, price stable and economical wind generated electric power to supply its facilities. Wind generated electric power is desirable because the wind will cost the same from year to year. Thus, procurement of wind energy, acts as a hedge against continually escalating fossil fuel energy prices, while providing environmental benefits. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Government is looking for a 50% wind generation as minimal percentage of the power supplied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Percentage of wind and renewable power will be evaluated as a part of the technical proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

Comparison of the proposed prices is considered in the overall evaluation of best value to the Government.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
For
SWIFT Phase II Implementation in CMS


This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of a small business that can modify the Strategic Work Information Folder Transfer (SWIFT) system to accommodate CMS executive and Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) correspondence functions.  SWIFT is the correspondence tracking system that is used by several agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) including CMS.  The version that CMS deployed on the Office of Secretary (OS) servers is the one for the Administration for Children and Families.  This gave CMS a workable application for a limited time period, for a limited number of users.  CMS must now enhance the SWIFT system to fulfill their correspondence needs and deploy it on their own web, application, task and database servers to expand the user base to all of CMS including the Regions. 

The government seeks to identify a contractor whose personnel have experience in modifying and deploying the SWIFT application in government facilities.  They must have experience: 
 Modifying the SWIFT application which includes editing the data entry screens, creating new folder types, and programming workflow features.
 Configuring the workspaces to mimic a government agencys organizational structure.   
 Configuring SWIFT users (both power users and gatekeepers) and assigning them to the appropriate workspaces or public exchange folders. 
 Training power users on the functions of the SWIFT application.
 Creating and modifying the SWIFT SQL Server database.  This includes adding new fields and tables.
 Converting data from other correspondence systems to the SWIFT SQL Server database server.
 Maintaining SWIFT system support on an ongoing basis. 
 Working with the server architecture in order to instruct government contractors on the design and setup of the SWIFT environment.  
 Working with the system engineers to deploy SWIFT in a government facility.  
 Creating reports from the SWIFT metadata.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the following analytical report:

Background: The notion that drugs do not have the same effects in every patient is well spread among healthcare professionals. For decades physicians have used characteristics such us age, weight and sex to select the right treatment for their patients. This approach, though very useful in the clinical practice, seems to have reached its limit.  There are still a large number of patients that do not respond to standard treatments or suffer from adverse effects. In recent years, advances in genomic research offered new possibilities toward the individualization of drug therapies. One good example is the application of genomics to the use of warfarin. The important variability in the response to warfarin is explained in part by genetic variants in the warfarin target, an enzyme called VKORC1, as well as the enzyme that clears warfarin from the body (CYP2C9). Patients with certain VKORC1 genetic variants are warfarin sensitive and require low warfarin doses. Likewise, patients with certain CYP2C9 genetic variants eliminate warfarin slowly and are more likely to have serious bleeding events when administered standard doses of warfarin. Pharmacogenetic testing, along with other characteristics of the patient, can provide an estimate of the therapeutic warfarin dose, improving the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy. Diagnostic tests to identify these and many other genetic variants relevant to the prescription of drugs are commercially available. However, the integration of genetic information to guide drug prescription is still limited. One of the reasons for such limitation is the scarcity of data supporting the clinical utility and the practical application of pharmacogenetic testing. The collection of that kind of data for each pharmacogenetic test and each drug by performing traditional clinical studies can be very costly and as such unlikely to occur. Therefore, it is important to identify other resources that can assist us in obtaining the necessary information to facilitate the use of genomics in the clinical practice. Pharmacy benefit providers collect and organize clinical and prescription data from their users. Many of these providers have also encouraged physicians to use certain pharmacogenetic tests as a guide to their prescription decisions and have developed the infrastructure to allow the prescription of the tests and the delivery of the results in a timely manner within their system, assuring the test results can be used effectively. The significant amount of data these providers collect and their experience in implementing pharmacogenetic testing make them a valuable resource to evaluate the utility of using genomics to aid drug prescribing.

A.	Key Objectives 

1) Identify drugs whose effectiveness and/or safety profiles can be improved by utilizing genetic information to guide prescription: Many drugs pose challenges in selecting the right dose or the patients that may benefit from them. However, pharmacogenetic tests are not available for all of these drugs. FDA aims at identifying the drug-test pairs that could be effectively applied to guide prescription. 
2) Identify available pharmacogenetic tests that can be effectively performed and utilized using a prescription-driven program: Some technical characteristics of the test can limit the application of pharmacogenetic testing to the patient care (e.g. by requiring sophisticated methods to obtain the sample or taking several days to deliver results).
3) Quantify the prescription of these drugs among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider: For most drugs, the utility of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical practice is related to the number of patients that are prescribed the drug and, therefore, would benefit from the new approach. 
4) Identify prescription patterns among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider: In addition to the number of patients that could potentially benefit from genetic-guided drug prescriptions, the characteristics of the patients that receive the drug (e.g. age, weight, race, etc.), the disease being treated, other drugs these patients receive, etc. are important factors affecting the utility of pharmacogenetic testing.
5) Evaluate the utility of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical setting: Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to increase the number of correct prescriptions for the selected drugs (the right drug at the right dose). 
6) Evaluate the effect of pharmacogenetic testing on the effectiveness and safety of the selected drugs in the clinical setting: By guiding prescribers in selecting the right drug at the right dose, pharmacogenetic testing can improve clinical outcome by increasing the rate of treatment response and decreasing the rate of treatment failure and the number and severity of adverse events.
7) Evaluate the ability of a prescription-driven feedback program to facilitate the utilization of pharmacogenetic tests in the clinical practice: It is necessary to identify effective ways to inform prescribers and patients about the test and its results, to make and implement the decisions based on the test results.

C.	Scope of Work 

This project shall be a collaborative effort of the FDA with a Pharmacy Benefit Provider (PBP).  PBP shall have access to a large patient database, which will allow us to measure the impact of pharmacogenetic testing. Upon selecting the drug-test pairs to be included in the study, FDA shall investigate the collaborators database to identify two cohorts of patients: those receiving the standard therapy and those receiving the pharmacogenetic-aided treatment.  Effectiveness and/or safety of the selected drugs will be compared between the two cohorts.  The metrics for evaluating impact on effectiveness/safety will be specific to each drug/pharmacogenetic test included in the study. Examples of these metrics are:
 Dose adjustment
 Treatment discontinuation or treatment substitution
 Number/ length of hospitalization 
 Emergency room visits
 Adverse events: bleeding events, sedation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, tremor, weight loss

Phase 1: A pilot study with warfarin shall be conducted to measure the impact of genetic testing for CYP2C9 and VKORC1.  This will provide a solid case study and will serve to establish the process (standard operating procedures or SOP). Duration: 6 months. 
Phase 2: Project expansion  following the SOP developed in phase 1, a list of other drug-test pairs, e.g. CYP2D6 and atomoxetine or selected opioids (codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol) shall be explored. Duration: 18 months.

This project will be completed in two years. All results will be published in peer-reviewed literature.
 

D.	Key Tasks 
1) Access to database containing rich and quality data from users on:
 Drugs prescription, dose, dose adjustments and discontinuation of treatment 
 Moderate and severe adverse events to treatment, number of doctors office visits and number of hospitalizations with the corresponding length of stay and cause in the period of drug prescription
 Time data to allow analysis of temporal relationship of all the above mentioned parameters
2) Access, experience and infrastructure to facilitate pharmacogenetic testing and appropriately organize and store the test results
3) Access to database containing rich and quality data from at least 1000 patients on:
 Warfarin prescription, dose, dose adjustments and number of INR tests for at least 6 months 
 CYP2C9 and VKORC1 test results or capability to facilitate testing and appropriately organize and store test results
 Bleeding events, number of doctors office visits and number of hospitalizations with the corresponding length of stay and cause in the period of warfarin prescription
 Time data to allow analysis of temporal relationship of all the above mentioned parameters
4) Delivery of:
 Weekly oral reports and monthly meetings on the progress of the project 
 Quarterly written progress reports (electronic version)
 Draft of final report for FDA review due 60 days before the completion of the project.
 Electronic versions of all presentations, reports, methodologies, and models in formats compatible with IBM PC Systems, preferably Microsoft Office
The weekly and monthly meetings will be used to monitor the progress of the project and to make adjustments to the plan as needed. The quarterly written reports will be evaluated, edited and kept for our records. 
 The final report shall be a joint effort between the contractor and the FDA. 
5) Optional: A minimum of one of the PBP staff member who is knowledgeable about the use of the software and the organization of the data within the database to work directly in the project. This staff member shall dedicate significant amount of his/her time to the project and shall be readily available to address our questions, comments and needs on the project.
6) Optional: Publishing the results in peer-reviewed literature

BACKGROUND
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), an Operating Division within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research.  Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve peoples health, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease, as well as the causes, treatments, and cures for common and rare diseases.

NIH research impacts:
 child and teen health, 
 men's health, 
 minority health, 
 seniors' health, 
 women's health, and 
 wellness and lifestyle issues. 

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.  For over a century, the National Institutes of Health has played an important role in improving the health of the nation. 

The goals of the Agency are as follows: 
1. foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis to advance significantly the Nation's capacity to protect and improve health; 
2. develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation's capability to prevent disease; 
3. expand the knowledge base in medical and associated sciences in order to enhance the Nation's economic well-being and ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research; and 
4. exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science. 

In realizing these goals, the NIH provides leadership and direction to programs designed to improve the health of the Nation by conducting and supporting research: 
 in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases; 
 in the processes of human growth and development; 
 in the biological effects of environmental contaminants; 
 in the understanding of mental, addictive and physical disorders; and 
 in directing programs for the collection, dissemination, and exchange of information in medicine and health, including the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librarians and other health information specialists.

The Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) is an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for remediation due to the presence of contaminated dredged material associated with historic dumping activities.  The HARS is being remediated with uncontaminated, Category I dredged material by placement of at least a 1-meter thick sediment cap.  A Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) developed for the HARS, encompasses, through tiered selection criteria, precision bathymetric surveying, side-scan sonar analysis, sub-bottom seismic profiling, surface and subsurface sediment collection and analysis (photography, benthic community structure analysis, grain size, chemical characteristics and toxicity, bio-assays and bio-accumulation studies), water quality analysis, oceanographic and sedimentological process studies.  The SMMP is being used as a guideline to manage placement of dredged material at the HARS, to ensure efficient construction of the 1-meter sediment cap, and to monitor changes at the HARS while remediation activities occur and, ultimately, to ensure remediation has been completed.  The USACE New York District (CENAN) is responsible for contracting and overseeing the various activities described in the SMMP.  A revised HARS SMMP is being prepared for adoption in 2008.  Alternative locations for ocean placement of dredged materials may be necessary after HARS remediation is completed and it may be necessary to investigate alternatives during the final years of HARS remediation.
This future contract will be used to complete the activities described in the HARS SMMP and related activities in a timely, technically sound, and cost effective manner.  Additionally, this contract will allow data collection associated with investigation of future sites for ocean placement of dredged materials.

It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is September 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $450,842. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top ten high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Collar Cervical EMS Extrication Univ Adult Adj Plastic/Foam Trach Open Hook and Loop Closure w/Chin Rest	$24,407.95<BR>Collar Cervical EMS Extrication 16 Adj Settings Plastic/Foam Trach Open Hook and Loop Closure	$20,898.68<BR>Collar Cervical Foam Med Density Universal 4.75inH 22inL Contoured w/ Stockinette Cover Hook and Loop Closure	$18,949.32<BR>Sling Arm Triangle Bandage Child	$14,043.93<BR>Splint Finger Strip 18inL x 0.75inW Aluminum Closed Cell Foam/White	$12,452.87<BR>Collar Cervical Adult w/Extra Pads Tall	$10,026.85<BR>Sling Arm Hemiplegic Left Large Cotton Envelope 2-Padded Shldr Straps w/Thumb Loop Padded Back	$9,083.53<BR>Collar Cervical Philadelphia Med 4.25inH 13-16inL w/Chin Rest Trach Open Adjustable Strap	$8,174.66<BR>Collar Cervical Adult w/Extra Pads Regular	$8,108.67<BR>Immobilizer Shoulder Sling Large PE Synthetic Closed Elbow/Open Hand Padded Shoulder/Body Strap	$7,977.20<BR><BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address), and all answers to the technical/company criteria to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.   After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>	1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company 	criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.<BR>2. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body products for single use. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in for this report as items ordered by the Europe region within a twelve month period. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>	a. Wrist Supports: Sizes-XSmall, Small, Medium, Large, Xlarge, 				and Universal.<BR>	b. Cervical Collars: Sizes-Small, Medium, Large, Universal, Children 6-			12yr, and Pediatric 2-6yr.<BR>	c. Arm Slings: Sizes- XSmall, Child, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge, and 			Universal.<BR>	d. Finger/Thumb Splints: Sizes-Universal, Small, Medium, and Assorted.		e. Elbow Sleeves, Bands, and Braces: Sizes-Small, Medium, Large, 				XLarge, and Universal.<BR>	f. Shoulder Immobilizers: Sizes-XSmall, Small, Medium, Large, and 			Universal.<BR>	g. Acromioclavicular and Clavicle Straps: Sizes-Infant, Small, Medium, 			Large, and Universal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________. <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV Owens & Minor for distribution in the Europe Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. (Note a vendor that fails to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (FDA 510K, OSHA regulations, and CDC guidelines) used in manufacturing Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products with initial submittal. <BR>7.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ. Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide contact information (Name, phone number, and e-mail address) for a local vendor representative in the Europe Region in response to this RFQ.<BR>9.	Vendors must supply literature demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this in response to this RFQ.<BR>10.	Vendors must provide statement revealing all product line items containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendors must provide documentation for all possible educational tools and materials that are available for Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products in response to this RFQ.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide documentation for 24/7 customer service and identify company resources for such support in response to this RFQ.<BR>13.	Vendors must provide documentation showing that their shoulder immobilizer has abduction capability in response to this RFQ.<BR>14.	Vendors must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices. Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities. The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria. Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>	1. Adjustable closure (proper fit). <BR>		a. Allows proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body part.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	2. Lightweight (patient comfort). <BR>		a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due 			to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	3. One-handed application and removal (self-application). <BR>		a. Due to the injury of the body part there is only the other extremity 				that is functional.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	4. Product has features to provide comfort to user (patient comfort). <BR>		a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to 				allow for patient comfort.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	5. Provides firm support (patient safety). <BR>		a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the 				body part from further injury.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	6. Allows (and does not impinge upon) range of motion (ROM) of the 					metacarpal phalangeal joints -MCPJs (finger joints) and the 				thumb (patient safety). <BR>		a. Some splints incorporate more than one joint above and/or below the 				injured body part. It is important that certain joints if they are 				not injured are allowed to move freely.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	7. Washable (patient hygiene, MTF cost savings). <BR>		a. Some splints have the capability to continue to provide support after 				washing.<BR>		b. Washing provides patient hygiene due to the length of time this 				particular splint needs to be applied.<BR>		c. Washing allows patient reuse of splint providing a cost savings to the 				MTF.<BR>		d. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	8. Secure Closure (patient safety). <BR>		a. Prevents accidental disconnects allowing stability and reduction of 				pain.	<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	9. Air Permeable/Breathable (patient comfort). <BR>		a. Splints and/or braces may cause increased perspiration thus 					discomfort. It is important for a cervical collar to allow some air 				flow reducing the severity of this process.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>10. Immobilization (patient safety). <BR>a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the 		body part from further injury.<BR>b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR><BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00 <BR><BR>Finger Splints-<BR>1.

After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above. However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines. <BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative. <BR>

<DESC>BACKGROUND: 
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates three HC-144A aircraft.  The HC-144A is manufactured by EADS CASA Aircraft based in Seville, Spain and procured under the authority of the aviation program management office (CG-931) through the USCG Deepwater acquisition program. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft.  End state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets.  The projected average flight hours for the HC-144A operational aircraft are 800  1,000 hours annually.  The following is a projected number of operational USCG aircraft for the next five-year period: 
Fiscal Year 	Projected No. of Aircraft 
FY09	05
FY10	07
FY11	12
FY12	14

These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support the Coast Guard Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, as well as surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.  USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in saltladen environments.  These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Aircraft and its components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCGs specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  
SYNOPSIS:
The U.S. Coast Guard (CG) is seeking information from potential sources that can provide repair and overhaul services for the Coast Guard HC-144A Main Landing Gear (MLG), Nose Landing Gear (NLG), shock absorbers, actuating cylinders, Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) components, as well as other associated assemblies, sub-assemblies, and components.  
The USCGs objectives are: 
To obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center or equivalent to effectively test, troubleshoot, clean, repair/overhaul, and/or modify MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components to the most current configuration and have them returned to service for CG operational use, in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition.  
To have all HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components, repaired/overhauled for returned to service with FAA Form 8130-3 or other FAA authorized airworthiness form attached.
To have all HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components, repaired/overhauled to meet OEMs specifications IAW the OEMs Component Maintenance Manuals, Service Bulletins, Modifications, and Specifications.  
To track and document flight time, calendar time, flight cycles, landings, and all work performed on HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components undergoing repair/overhaul as required under USCG ACMS.  This is accomplished via a Component Repair Record (CRR) which is used by the CG to update the Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) and to maintain the integrity OEM restoration intervals and life cycle limits as applicable to the HC-144A MLG and NLG assemblies.  
To obtain and observe at least two levels of repair/overhaul services for HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components.  The USCG anticipates at least two levels of service and contractors may propose additional levels, as such for separate incorporation of service bulletins, completion of modifications, the breakout of major components, etc.  At a minimum, these two levels of service, Repair, and Overhaul, must be addressed.  
REPLIES:
All interested parties should respond in writing to CWO Kevin S. Barrick, HC-144A Engineering, c/o Commanding Officer, USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, phone: 252-334-5153, FAX: 252-384-7309, e-mail address (Kevin.S.Barrick@uscg.mil

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): VA-101-08-RI-0186 Protective Peer ReviewThe Office of Quality and Performance (OQP), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Department of Veterans Affairs, is responsible for managing VHA's Protected Peer Review Program. The primary purpose of the Peer Review is to foster collaborative learning and improvement of healthcare. The Department is planning for the acquisition of Peer Review services to assist OQP in providing immediate and long-term improvements in care provided by revealing areas for improvement in provider practice. Peer Review is a process of subjecting a provider's medical care to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the field and is defined to include critical reviews of an episode of care performed by a peer and/or group of peers. A peer is an individual of similar education, training, licensure, and clinical privileges.VHA has identified multiple capabilities and/or services that will be required of the Peer Review services provider and is issuing this Request for Information to enable vendors to submit capability statements. Capability statements will be used to assist VA in defining its acquisition strategy and identify sources able to provide the services requested. VHA requires a Contractor that can provide the following services/capabilities:1. Coordinate a process of Peer Review in which the medical care of a VA provider for a specific episode of care is subjected to scrutiny by another provider deemed to be an expert in that field. The types of episodes that will be subject to review will be selected by a variety of means, including:a. Random sample audits of cases already subjected to Internal Peer Review by VA staff.  Vendor would need to propose an auditing framework that would allow sufficient cases to be reviewed to ensure overall quality of VA's internal peer review processes, while recognizing that excessive auditing would not be a wise use of taxpayer dollars.b. Facility-initiated requests to review a specific episode(s) of care in the event that an appropriate internal peer reviewer cannot be found.c. Targeted or triggered situations - i.e., facilities with statistical indicators of poor performance (e.g., mortality or morbidity outliers) would undergo chart audit and peer review of one or more episodes of care to identify possible quality problems and improvement opportunities.Note: The vendor would need to complete the review within 45 days of assignment for most cases (exception would be for targeted/triggered reviews in which multiple records might need to be reviewed by a clinical expert, in which case a project timeframe would be negotiated).2. Provide peer reviewers that are board certified, recognized experts in the field, and clinically up-to-date. Capabilities statements shall address the process and/or methodologies employed for selection of peer reviewers. 3. Provide process and/or methodologies to evaluate the reliability and validity of the reviews done by the external experts.4. Provide process and/or methodologies to evaluate and/or measure peer reviewer and Contractor performance.5. Provide the ability to partner with Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Small Disadvantaged Businesses in performing the services identified. Included shall be information pertaining to successful achievement of subcontracting goals/plans on previous requirements. Interested vendors may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the services identified via email to Shaundra Duggans at Shaundra.Duggans@va.gov not later than 4:00 PM EST May 23, 2008. Vendors are asked to provide three past performance references for the capabilities identified. Include the Project title, Description of the project, Contract number, Contract amount, Government Agency/Organization and Point of Contact, and phone number/email address.  Do you hold a GSA contract? If so, please identify Schedule and Contract number? Telephone inquiries will NOT be accepted. In addition to the provision of capabilities statements, an industry day(s) will be held to allow interested parties a chance to expand on their capabilities in a direct conversation with Government officials. Industry day(s) will be held the week of June 16th. All vendors interested in participating in industry day shall contact Shaundra Duggans to schedule an appointment. It is anticipated that each appointment will be 45 minutes to an hour in length and be held at a VA facility in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.. All correspondence shall be sent via email to both addresses identified and shall reference the RFI number and title in the subject line.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Vehicles Directorate, will be hosting an Industry Day event on 5-6 JUN 2008 at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH (Perkins Room, Building 146, Area B). The purpose of this Industry Day is to discuss the Aerospace Technology Evaluation and Assessment (ATEA) program. The first day of the event will include tours of the research facilities associated with ATEA and presentations describing the technical activities that are expected to be accomplished under the ATEA effort. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is anticipated to be released on 25 JUL 2008 for the ATEA program. Information contained in the final BAA synopsis takes precedence over any information that is presented at Industry Day or associated with this Industry Day announcement.
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Aerospace industry are continuously adapting to the evolving operational environment, and the Air Forces must be prepared to operate in this changing environment and to provide new warfighter capabilities to meet the nation's need. New capabilities typically come from modifying the use of existing systems, marrying new technologies with existing systems, or developing completely new technologies and concepts. Developing new concepts of employment and transitioning emerging technologies has always been a challenge; one approach that facilitates the process is to extensively use Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&amp;A) during all phases of weapons system development effort.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&amp;A) is key to ensuring a strong connectivity between DoD and AF requirements, and the needs of the acquisition community and the warfighter. MS&amp;A can span all phases of acquisition and provides avenues to meet the needs of science &amp; technology, test &amp; evaluation, and training &amp; operational communities. Collaborative MS&amp;A across system-of-systems is a key enabler to ensure correlation among the stakeholders. The ATEA program is focused on the planning and execution of such MS&amp;A activities.<br />The ATEA Industry Day will be held in the Perkins Room (Building 146, AREA B), Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio, on 5-6 June 2008. ALL ATTENDEES MUST REGISTER BY 30 MAY 2008 BY CONTACTING ONE OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS:</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">VULCAN is a propulsion system demonstration program to
design, build and ground test an engine capable of accelerating a full scale hypersonic
vehicle from rest to Mach 4+.<span>&nbsp; </span>The VULCAN
engine will consist of an integrated Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) engine
and a full scale turbine engine.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CVC
engine architectures could include Pulsed Detonation Engines (PDE&rsquo;s),
Continuous Detonation Engines (CDE&rsquo;s) or other unsteady CVC engine architectures.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The CVC engine would operate from below
the upper Mach limit of the turbine engine to Mach 4+. <span>&nbsp;</span>The turbine engine will be a current production
engine capable of operating above Mach 2 and may be based on any of the
following engines, the F100-229, F110-129, F119 or F414 engines.<span>&nbsp; </span>A key objective of the program is to
integrate the turbine engine into the VULCAN engine with minimal modification to
the turbine engine, to operate the turbine engine from rest to its upper Mach
limit and to cocoon the turbine engine when it is not in use.<span>&nbsp; </span>It desired that both the turbine and the CVC
engines share a common inlet and nozzle. It is envisioned that developing the
VULCAN engine will enable full scale hypersonic cruise vehicles for
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, strike or other critical national
missions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The initial dissemination of information on this initiative
will be the VULCAN Program Industry Day<em> </em>on<span style="color: black;"> June 10, 2008.<span>&nbsp; </span>The</span> goals of this meeting are threefold: 1) to familiarize participants with
DARPA&rsquo;s interest in combining turbine engines with constant volume combustion
engine cycles, 2) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of
the BAA proposal requirements, and 3) to promote discussion of synergistic
capabilities among potential program participants.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is our desire to facilitate the formation
of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive,
quality responses to any potential DARPA solicitation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Industry Day will be held at 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Ste

<DESC>The Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory(NETL)cordially invites interested parties to attend an Open House for potentialofferors on the follow-on solicitation(s) for NETLs Research andDevelopmentSupport and Technology and Management Support contracts.  The intent ofthisOpen House is to encourage full and open competition resulting in the bestvalue for NETL.The Open House is scheduled for June 4th and 5th, 2008.  Opening remarksand atour of NETLs Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania site will be held on June 4th, andatour of NETLs Morgantown, West Virginia site will be held on June 5th.TheJune 5th activities will also include a video presentation of NETLsAlbany,Oregon site.The NETL is one of three Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratoriesthataddress the marketplace challenges of meeting our nations energy demands.NETL is unique among DOE national laboratories in both its mission and itsapproach to achieving that mission.  The laboratory is federally owned andoperated, a departure from the contractor-operated model that is the normwithin the DOE laboratory system.  As the only laboratory with fossilenergy asits principal focus, NETL applies basic science and engineering to resolvetheenvironmental, supply, and reliability constraints of producing and usingfossil resources.  Our onsite researchers solve complex problems in energysystem dynamics, geologic and environmental challenges, advanced materialsandprocesses, and computational and basic sciences.  NETL seeks solutions to awide range of energy challenges through these follow-on contracts.In addition to conducting cutting-edge research and technology developmentonsite, NETL shapes, funds, and manages contracted research in the UnitedStatesand more than 40 foreign countries. Our research portfolio includes morethan1,800 projects, with a total award value of over $9 billion and privatesectorcost-sharing of over $5 billion.  These projects are carried out throughvarious contractual arrangements including the aforementioned site supportcontracts which NETL will soon be recompeting.The Open House is not a pre-solicitation conference and attendance is notmandatory.  The Open House is only a tour of the facility to familiarizepotential offerors with the breadth of work being conducted at NETL.  Allquestions that arise during the Open House must be submitted in writing inaccordance with the instructions listed in the FEDBIZOPPS announcement.  Aspart of the strategy to provide information that may benefit potentialofferorsin preparing their proposals, NETL has established an electronic readingroomat http://www.netl.doe.gov/business/index.html.  Upon completion of theOpenHouse, a video of the tour will be posted on the electronic reading roomalongwith other relative information.If you are interested in attending, please R.S.V.P. by May 30th toStephanieKennedy, Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, 626Cochrans Mill Road, P.O. Box 10940, Pittsburgh, PA  15236-0940, (412)386-5507or stephanie.kennedy@netl.doe.gov.  Attendance will be limited to a maximumofthree employees from each company.  Due to NETLs security requirements,allattendees must R.S.V.P. by May 30th, must be U.S. citizens, and must bringphoto identification with them at the time of their visit.We look forward to your participation at the Open House.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

FAR 52.212-1 Instructions of Offerors  Commercial Items  (Nov 2007) 

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) Remit to address, if different than mailing address; 
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); 
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

The Contractor shall also annually control up to 50 Russian olive trees using a stump cut and herbicide application approach.  The location of all herbicide treatments shall be coordinated through the Government point of contact (POC), 10 CES/CECN Natural Resources.

2.  The application methods used for weed control may include boom and spot spraying (tractor-mounted, truck-mounted, all-terrain vehicle or backpack) during the most susceptible phenological stage for each target weed species.  The level of weed control shall be 95% or greater.  After 30 days post-treatment, any areas with less than 95% control shall be re-sprayed at no additional cost to the Government.  For isolated plants and small populations, mechanical plant removal (pulling or digging) and seed head harvesting may also be used to achieve control.

3.  The Contractor shall follow all application guidelines provided by the manufacturer for each herbicide used.  The Contractor shall not apply herbicides if the sustained wind speed exceeds 10 miles per hour.

4.  The Contractor shall be certified as a Commercial Applicator in the State of Colorado for rangeland pest control and shall provide copies of all certifications, licenses, and insurance certificates via submittal letter to the Contracting Officer who will provide them to the POC.  All field applicators and supervisors shall be current in any required safety training. In addition, spill containment and cleaning kits shall be included in each contractor vehicle while on site.  Any spill must be immediately reported to the USAFA Pest Management Coordinator, (719)-333-6716, and the USAFA Spill Response Team (911).

5.  All herbicide, labor, tools, equipment and supplies needed to perform this SOW shall be furnished by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall submit a list of herbicides to be used, along with their respective product labels and Material Safety Data Sheets, to the Pest Management Coordinator.  The Contractor shall update this information when a new herbicide is approved for use. Unapproved herbicides may be considered for use if they are authorized by the State of Colorado and a product justification is provided to the Academy Pest Management Coordinator.

6.  All herbicides must be approved by the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) (AFPMB - DoD Standard Pesticides & Pest Control Equipment Lists) and the U.S.A.F. Academy Pest Management Coordinator, (719)-333-6716, and shall be tracked through the Installation HAZMAT Management Process (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI32-7086.pdf).  The contractor shall store all herbicides off-site.  No chemical mixing or storage shall be permitted on the U.S.A.F. Academy grounds.

7.  All herbicide applications shall be recorded on an Air Force Form 1532 and a copy of the form and a calculation of the amount of herbicide active ingredient used shall be submitted to the Pest Management Coordinator on a monthly basis. The Contractor shall also maintain a map of the treated areas and weed species targeted.  The map shall be provided to the USAFA Natural Resources Office at the end of each spraying season.

8. Points of Contact: POC & Quality Assurance Evaluator (10 CES/CECN Natural Resources) (719-333-3308); USAFA Spill Response Team-911; USAFA Pest Management Coordinator (719)-333-6716.

9.  Bid Proposal Pricing: Bids shall be submitted on a cost per acre basis for a total of 350 acres.

A separate bid shall also be submitted on a cost per tree basis for 50 Russian olive trees annually.

10.  Work Performance Period:  Annual herbicide spraying treatments shall occur during the growing season and whenever the phenological condition of the weeds is conducive to achieving the desired degree of control.

Solicitation Number: TIRNO-08-R-00017

Description	

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (services) prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP); solicitation number is TIRNO-08-R-00017, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.  This is a service contract and service contract wage rates apply.  Wage determinations under the Service Contract Act can be downloaded from the following website: www.wdol.gov.  Relevant Wage Determinations for all geographic areas serviced by any contracts resulting from this solicitation will apply.  Applicable Wage Determinations for locations and classes of service employees proposed will be incorporated into all contracts resulting from this solicitation.  This Service Contract base period shall be for twelve (12) months. In this solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24 effective 28 February 2008.  The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) is 561613 Armored Car Services.  This procurement is unrestricted.

All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The Internal Revenue Service has a requirement to procure the following:

Background

The Internal Revenue Service intends to purchase secure courier services for the pickup and delivery of cash tax payments.  There are currently 177 IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) located throughout the United States.  Each business day, the cash funds collected from tax payments must be safely transported to a designated financial institution. Currently, there is no uniform system for safely handling and delivering these funds.  

Objectives

The goal of this procurement is to establish a safe and uniform process for delivering cash from IRS TACs to TGA banks/cash vaults (see attached List).  The use of secure courier services will enable the funds to be safely transferred and accounted for.  Because there are 177 centers located throughout the country, it is imperative that the vendors selected for contract awards be able to cover all of the tax centers on a nationwide basis.  In order to create an effective process for the transfer of these funds, the successful vendors shall collectively be able to supply secure courier services for all given locations.  The number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the offerors.

NOTE:  While there are 177 TAC sites overall, ten (10) of these sites have been identified as priority requirements and will be temporarily serviced by other means.  For the purposes of the contract(s) resulting from this solicitation, ALL TAC sites should be priced.  The 10 priority sites will be awarded as optional contract line items (CLINs) for the base award period, with the expectation that they will be added to the base period during FY 09.  All of the 177 TAC sites will be included as CLINs in Option Year Periods 1 through 4.  By including these 10 additional/priority TACs in this way, pricing will be predetermined when the need arises to add these TACs as active pickup sites at some point in the future. 
The secure courier service will pick up cash receipts and the deposit form (Form 10160  see attached) at the TAC by close of business, Monday through Friday (excluding Federal Holidays: New Years Day; Martin Luther King Jr. Day; Washingtons Birthday; Memorial Day; Independence Day; Labor Day; Columbus Day; Veterans Day; Thanksgiving Day; Christmas Day.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
	a) The Government will award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror or offerors whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   

1) Ability to meet Tasks/Requirements/Deliverables outlined in the Solicitation  
2) Geographical Area(s) covered, number of locations proposed
3) Ability to pick up receipts from the TACs before close of business each day and to comply with same day deposit requirement
4) Security of services provided 
5) Proper bonding/licensing/insurance 
6) Experience
7) Past Performance
8) Pricing

The factors above are listed in order of importance. Technical Factors one (1) through six (6) and past performance are more important, when combined, compared to Price.  The importance of price will increase as the difference in technical comparisons decreases.  Award(s) will be made relative to best overall value to the Government.  Offers must meet all minimum qualifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability and past performance are more importance than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.  

Offerors shall provide a minimum of three references with name of company, point of contact, and phone number for past performance.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640, UNITED STATES

Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number SB1341-08-RQ-0309 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541690 with a small business size standard of $6.5M. THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED AND ONLY SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE. 

The NIST Information Access Division (IAD) has a requirement for advisement and assistance in formulating strategies for assessing automated latent search core technology, and assistance in the creation of tools (e.g., standards, datasets) needed to accomplish this.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

---BEGINNING OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK---


I.	Background

The Evaluation of Latent Fingerprint Technology (ELFT) Project, administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), Information Access Division (IAD), Image-Group, requires Contractor support in the area of latent fingerprints. The goals of the ELFT project are to: 1) assess the current state-of-the art in automated (lights-out) latent fingerprint processing; 2) determine weakness in current matcher algorithms and, to the extent possible, determine their root causes; 3) provide definitions of standardized performance measures, including mathematical formulations and analysis; and 4) create/improve/characterize testing datasets. The required Contractor support covers all the above areas, though to varying degrees. The largest amount of effort is expected to be in the dataset area. These services will assist in guiding policies and procedures for automated latent fingerprint search developments that are both more effective and efficient.  

II.	Contractor Qualifications
The individual providing the services (to be referred to as the Contractor) shall have at least fifteen (15) years of experience in latent fingerprint technology and must have an in-depth knowledge of the following areas:

1)	latent fingerprint types and methods of collection
2)	challenges associated with the search and identification (individualization) of latent fingerprints
3)	computer searches/automation of fingerprint searches
4)	forensic data presentation 
5)	familiarity with how the FBI, other Federal Agencies, and local law enforcement utilize latent fingerprints
6)	familiarity with Interpol and other international organizations using latent fingerprints
7)	data interchange formats and their challenges

III.	Scope of Work

The Contractor shall advise and assist in formulating strategies for assessing automated latent search core technology, and assist in the creation of tools (e.g., standards, datasets) needed to accomplish this.  The eventual goal of the project is a more effective processing of latent fingerprint images via better automation and workflow. 


IV.	Specific Tasks and Associated Performance Standards

The required services fall into three categories: 1) technical reports on specified topics; 2) tutorials; and 3) ad hoc consulting.

a)	Task 1.  Technical reports

For each technical report, the Contractor shall coordinate approaches, procedures, criteria and recommendations with a working group specified by NIST.  The working group may include representatives from other government agencies and from industry.  The working group may consist of up to 20 people.  The Contractor shall generate technical reports in Microsoft Word 2003.  Draft reports are due within 45 days from the date of the request.  NIST and the working group will review each report.  All comments will be consolidated by NIST and forwarded to the Contractor for incorporation into a final technical report.  Each final technical report is due 5 days from receipt of comments.  

Each report shall include an executive summary, table of contents, detailed description of latent fingerprint issues, procedures, conclusions, and recommendations.  A separate technical report is required for the following topics: 


1)	Development of a systematic approach for latent image characterization and development of latent image quality metrics.

2)	Detailed rules for specifying Region-of-Interest (ROI), to be used in creating ROI masks for latent searches; 

3)	Criteria for the definition/selection/prioritization of augment latent feature sets (e.g., CDEFFS).

b)	Task 2.  Technical Presentations and Training

Within ten (10) days from notification from the NIST Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), the Contractor shall provide a technical presentation of each report and detailed training on procedures at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.  

c)	Task 3.  Consultation

The contractor shall provide up to forty (40) hours of ad hoc consultation  in response to specific latent fingerprint topics requested by the NIST COTR.   The contractor shall respond back to the NIST COTR within five (5) days from the date of the request for consultation.  The response may be verbal, but must be followed up in writing as a hardcopy or electronic white paper within the time specified in this paragraph.

It is anticipated that much of the work will be performed at the Contractors location. Tutorials and coordination meeting may require travel on the part of the Contractor to the NIST facility. The Contractor will be reimbursed for such travel at the customary rate. A budget of $1000.00 has been set aside for travel.

V.	Period of Performance and Location Work is to be performed

The period of performance shall be 9 months from date of award with two (2) optional 12-month periods.  Most of the work shall be performed at the Contractors facility and at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland for task 2.
 
VI.	Government-Furnished Property, Data, and Information
	The Contractor will be provided with office space, desk, telephone, and personal computer in the NIST Gaithersburg facility. Such material will be provided no later than five (5) days following contract award.
	The Contractor will also be provided, on an as needed basis, with access to sensitive but unclassified data. Such data may not be taken outside of the NIST facility.
	The Contractor may have access to vendor proprietary data; in this event the Contractor will be required to sign an applicable non-disclosure agreement.
	All material provided by the Government in the performance of this task remains the property of the Government and must be surrendered to the government upon completion or termination of this requirement.

VII.	Exhibits and Attachments

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The following items where discussed during this Conference;

1.	The conference began at 0805 in Conference Room A of Building 8110 and was opened by Scott Rogers. He welcomed the participants and reminded them that nothing in the Conference would qualify the terms and conditions of the solicitation and specifications and that the terms of the solicitation and specifications remain unchanged unless the solicitation is amended in writing.   He then introduced Dr. Brian Mihlbachler.

2.	Dr. Mihlbachler gave a short briefing that included the background of noxious weeds spraying efforts at the USAF Academy (USAFA), a short technical discussion of the types of noxious weeds and their location using the aerial map, the location of no-spray areas due to Prebbles mouse habitats, external access points to USAFA and to points within USAFA, the location of training areas and secure areas, and identified the pest management coordinator.

3.	The following questions were submitted:

a.	Do you have to exit USAFA to mix herbicides? Yes. The contractor can mix a large tank offsite and fill into smaller tanks within USAFA.
b.	Will USAFA provide a water supply? No.
c.	Will USAFA send an inspector as an escort with the contractor? No, USAFA will conduct spot checks.
d.	Will USAFA provide security escorts? Only in areas that require escorts. The successful Offeror will submit a list of employees that will, upon clearance through a local police check, be issued a badge authorizing them access to the majority of USAFA.
e.	Will USAFA treat 50 Russian Olives every year? No. Russian Olives will be identified on a case by case basis. There may not be any in the years after the base year. There are some near I-25 that are the responsibility of CDOT. The contractor will treat trees more than 50 feet from the road. The contractor may also treat some resprouts.
f.	What types of vehicles are allowed off-road? Most areas are accessible to 4-wheel drive motor vehicles and ATVs. In a few areas a long hose layout or a backpack may be required.
g.	Are the 350 areas to be covered treated or covered acres? Treated acres. This will be based on budget, the wheather, and when the limit for active ingredients has been met.
h.	Is pricing data available from the previous contract? No.
i.	How many applications are required in the summer? Due to the continuous nature of the maturing of weeds applications are made on an almost continuous basis during the growing season.

4.	A tour of USAFA rangelands was conducted from 0835 to1035. Along the east boundary Dr. Mihlbachler pointed out areas with Prebbles Mouse habitat. Near the northwest corner of USAFA Dr. Mihlbachler showed all participants an area where there a group of rare plants (Rocky Mountain Cinquefoil). Near the entrance to Jacks Valley Dr. Mihlbachler pointed out that Buffalo Berry trees (Cherperdis) have been mistaken for Russian Olive and that care needs to be taken to properly identify Russian Olives. The Conference concluded upon return to Building 8110.

5.	If the question you asked at the site visit is not present or properly represented here please contact Scott Rogers, 719-333-6368,  or submit it by e-mail and it will be corrected, answered, and posted.

L	EVALUATION FACTORS 
Award will be made to the responsible quoter submitting an overall quote that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Award will be made to the firm whose quote meets the Governments requirements and whose technical performance and price represent the best value to the Government. The evaluation of quotes will be based on a technical evaluation of the Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, Experience in Successful Delivery of the Required Classes and Past Performance non-price evaluation factors.  Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements and Experience are equally important to the Past Performance.  When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (1) Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, (2) Experience and (3) Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions.  Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoters best terms. 

L-1	Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements 
The quoter must demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as set forth in the SOW.  Provide evidence of Defense Acquisition University (DAU) course equivalency and evidence of American Council on Education (ACE) accreditation.  Include a statement of how many college credits will be awarded for each course.  Provide resumes that demonstrate the qualifications of the instructors who are available to teach the courses.  Based upon this, the quote will be evaluated on:
Demonstrated ability to meet the requirements in the specific areas specified under Description/Scope of Work, Paragraph F-1 Training Specifications, Paragraph F-2 Program Requirements and Paragraph F-3 Instructor Qualification Requirements. 
Resumes must be received for all instructors being offered under this RFQ.  Resumes shall not exceed 3 pages in length.  All resumes must include a signed statement by the offered individual that they either currently work for the educational institution and will work under the resulting award or will accept employment if the quoter receives the award based upon the resume submitted.  

L-2	Experience in Successful Delivery of the Required Classes
The Government will evaluate the experience of each quoter.  The quoter shall discuss its experience in providing CON 100  Shaping Smart Business Arrangements and CON 110  Mission Support Planning or similar classes.
Demonstrated experience in successful delivery of the courses specified under Description/Scope of Work, Paragraph B OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE. 

L-3	Past Performance
The Government will evaluate relevant past performance of each quoter.  The quoter shall identify five (5) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government or commercial organizations that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.  Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.  Please include the following information:
	Course Title
	Description of the Course
	Contract/Task Order Number
	Contract/Task Order Amount
	Government Agency/Organization
	COTRs name, address, phone number and email address
	Contracting Officers name, address, telephone number and email address
	Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates
	List of courses delivered to customer including delivery date
	A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task. 
Quoters shall not include any price information in the technical quote.
PRICE:  The price quote shall include the Firm Fixed Price for each required course and the Total Firm Fixed Price.  The firm fixed price shall include all costs required to deliver the courses including facilities, travel of instructor to exclude local travel, training materials, etc.  The price quote must contain the Firm Fixed Price information along with the Representations and Certifications identified in Paragraph K of this combined synopsis/solicitation.
The technical quote submission shall be limited to 12 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.) and the past performance section shall be limited to 2 one-sided pages (also inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.)  The price quote has no page limitations.  All quotes should be provided with a cover page and table of contents for both the Technical and the Price sections.  No pricing information is to be provided within the quoters technical quote.  The font for submissions shall be set at Arial [no smaller than] 11 with 1 inch margins.  All responses shall be submitted in MS Word format.  

M	SUBMISSION OF QUOTE
All quotes, both technical and price, are due no later than May 27, 2008, 2:00pm, Washington, D.C. time.  Quotes are to be e-mailed to Ms. Tarasia Remhof at tarasia.remhof1@dhs.gov and to Ms. Darlene Bullock at darlene.bullock@dhs.gov.  Faxed or mailed quotes will not be accepted.  Please note that any administrative costs or expenses incurred by quoters in responding to this solicitation are NOT reimbursable by the government.  The Contracting Officer may at any time, via amendment to this RFQ, alter acquisition strategy, readdress the requirement, or effect administrative changes as he or she deems necessary.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity

In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
FOR AFSO 21 COURSEWARE CONVERSION


1.  The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for converting approximately 3300 hours of classroom instruction into computer based training (CBT).  This will impact 100  150 courses to distance learning.  The Government will provide a list of candidate courses to the provider.  The list is currently being refined and will be finalized at time of solicitation.  Some courses will be identified for immediate conversion.  Other courses will require feasibility studies to be performed.  Courses will consist primarily of knowledge based refresher or supplemental training.  Interactivity levels will range from level 1 thru 3.  It is expected that 25-30% will be level 1 with 60% at level 2 and 10-15% at level 3.  

2.  Courseware will be SCORM conformant in accordance with DODI 1322.26.  Results of SCORM self test will be required.  Self test software is available at http://www.adlnet.gov/downloads/index.aspx

3.  Courseware will be Section 508 conformant.  Completed checklist available at https://adlhub.golearn.csd.disa.mil/hub/tools_resources/tr_checklist.asp will be required to ensure conformance.  

4.  Provider will provide all documentation required by Air Force policy (AFI 36-2201, AETCI 36-2203, AETCI 36-2209).  These policies and publications can be found at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/

5.  The contractor shall provide sufficient, qualified personnel to perform the required services.

6.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 611710 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611710, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $6.5 million).  Small business means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than small business in the next 90 days, please indicate as such.

7.  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date, we will issue an RFP to industry for a period of 2 years.  The anticipated award date is September 2008.

8.  It is the Governments intent to award one contract.  The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).

9.  All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:

A.  Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.
B.  Mailing Address.
C.  Point of Contact (to include phone/fax and e-mail).
D.  Web site, if applicable.
E.  State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611710 or not.
F.  State whether your company is small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUB-Zone, or 8(a) certified business concern.
G.  State the size of your company in terms of personnel.
H.  Degree of experience converting classroom instruction into computer based training (CBT). 
I.  Identify any past or current Government contracts for converting courseware within the last three years.
J.  Briefly describe how your company can satisfy the requirements described above, and your associated technical capabilities.

10.  Responses are due no later than 1600 CST, THURSDAY, 29 May 2008, and shall be electronically submitted to both the Contract Specialist, 2Lt Bryce Fiacco, at bryce.fiacco@randolph.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Mr. Kevin Shackleford, at kevin.shackleford@randolph.af.mil in a Word 97 (or above) or Adobe PDF file format.

11.  Questions relative to this market research should be sent electronically to both 2Lt Bryce Fiacco and Kevin Shackleford.

12.  NO PHONE INQUIRIES.  All communications shall be in writing.

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training Capability
This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.  Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys capability.
2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)
3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.
4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John Webb at (937) 904-4254.



REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) SeeksCooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) 
Collaborators for 
NAFLD, NASH & Cryptogenic Cirrhosis Clinical Trials

Amended to Extend Deadline - National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks Industry collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to provide novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers and devices for use in NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials and studies in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis. 

BACKGROUND:
The NAFLD Database study - A prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis was created by the NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN), which has accrued over 1,500 adults and pediatric subjects over the past 3 years.  In addition to the NAFLD Database study, the NASH CRN has developed two treatment trials: (1) PIVENS: to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with either pioglitazone or vitamin E lowers NASH activity as determined from hepatic histology in nondiabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo, (2) TONIC: to determine whether 96 weeks of treatment with either metformin or vitamin E leads to sustained reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase in nondiabetic children with NAFLD compared to treatment with placebo. PIVENS and TONIC have completed recruitment and these studies are expected to be completed in 2009.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease present a variety of opportunities for CRADAs.

STUDY GOALS:
The overall goal of the NASH Clinical Research Network sponsored by the NIDDK is to focus on the etiology, contributing factors, natural history, complications, and therapy of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  The NASH CRN studies currently comprise a large and well characterized population of individuals with various stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis.  

The NASH CRN is interested in conducting research that will lead to improved clinical outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cryptogenic cirrhosis patients with industry collaborators to:  
-	Evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, epigenomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH as well as clinical trials to assess optimal treatment of adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD, NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Develop serum/plasma proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiomic and expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis and that would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease. 
-	Explore use of serum markers for fibrosis and serum markers for disease activity to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic variables in the NAFLD Database study. 
-	Explore the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in adult (PIVENS) and pediatric (TONIC) treatment trials.
-	Evaluate a panel of serological assays that reflect hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress to differentiate among NAFLD, NASH, or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Investigate proprietary drugs, reagents, or devices in controlled randomized clinical trials as potential therapy for NASH, NAFLD and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis in children and/or adults.  
-	Evaluate noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NAFLD/NASH including but not limited to the use of elastrography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and molecular imaging.
-	Identify protein alterations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Evaluate the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH or NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum peroxides in patients with NASH or NAFLD participating in treatment trials. 
-	Evaluate the use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necroinflammatory or fibrotic activity in NAFLD or NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NAFLD or NASH. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Industry for the described ancillary studies. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  It is not a grant, and it is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a predetermined field of use and may make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this
announcement to aid in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address the following selection criteria: 
1. 	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of the pharmacologic, surgical or device intervention in patients with NAFLD or NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients. 
2. 	The statement should provide a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agent or device in a timely manner for the duration of the study. 
3.	Must include a description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing such tests.
4.	A description of other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  
5.	A description of the methods that would be used to assure patient privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
6.	If appropriate, include specific funding commitment to support the advancement of research directed to NAFLD, NASH, and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis clinical trials.
7.	Must agree to have their preparation used in NASH CRN-developed protocols which will be conducted by the NASH CRN and will have data collection and analysis performed by the NASH Data Coordinating Center.
8.	Must provide a letter of cross reference to the sponsor of the NASH studies to be included with any US FDA filing that contains the chemistry, manufacturing and control information for the drug substance and drug product or device Master File.

STATEMENT OF WORKGOVERNMENT  RANGE LASER SAFETY SUPPORT
1.0	Background.  Range laser safety is the process of certifying training ranges around the world for safe laser use. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) helps provide a context to more efficiently certify training ranges throughout the world for safe laser use. This effort will provide the Government Range Laser Safety Specialists (RLSS) with support in the form of graphical representations, technical advice, training, geospatial assets, and databases of various targets, firing points, laser safety issues and recommendations, etc. 5 years of such training range data has been acquired, on an as-needed basis in support of this mission, since geospatial technologies were introduced. Also provided will be assistance on the evaluation of GIS related interfaces and/or toolkits generated by other activities, conducting the RLSS course and nominating individuals for certification, supporting and managing the digital database for various training ranges around the world.1.1	Purpose.  The critical management issue associated with airborne and ground laser designation is the allowable buffer associated with each type of laser designator used in training exercises (i.e. the laser beam moving downrange can be a severe hazard to personnel within its associated Laser Hazard Danger Zone (LHDZ)). The dimensions and geometry of the Laser HDZ is defined in the LSRB Handbook and in the OPNAVINST 5100.27/MCO 5104.1B. For ground use, the LHDZ is based on the areas inherent topology surrounding the firing and target location; for airborne use, the LHDZ is based on the lasers buffer angle and/or the geometry of the given terrain. The buffer angle is determined by the lasers platform. This effort will provide the Government with graphical representations of Laser Target Areas (LTAs), Firing Points (FPs), and Point Targets (PTs), etc that will allow the RLSS to make precise calculations and establish proper LHDZs for a specific tactical training range. The support will enhance the Governments ability to certify ranges for safe laser use, to certify interested individuals to become RLSSs, and to manage the digital database of various training ranges around the world. Due to the creation, over the past five years, of a multitude of data sets of various training ranges around the world, a concerted effort must be taken to organize, standardize, inventory, disseminate, and archive these holdings in order for the Government to manage the laser safety program properly.  1.2	Applicable Regulations and Documents.1.2.1	OPNAVINST 5100.27C/MCO 5104.1B2.0	Objectives. This effort will provide the Government with the support to generate precise data and associated accurate graphical representations of training ranges throughout the world, technical support, training, and the evaluation of toolkits developed by other program offices in support of range laser safety. Data resources, products, and documentation will be standardized and inventoried for recall and/or reference.3.0	Scope. This project will be limited to supporting the Government with semi-automated tasks that include the graphical representation & data set creation of targets and firing points and other areas of geographical interests for various ranges throughout the world, RLSS training and certification, and management of digital data associated with the training ranges. The purpose of this support is to develop the products primarily utilizing the ESRI ArcGIS Software suite, and current GPS technologies, plus related GIS\Desktop Publishing software and overlay them on precise geographical base data (representing specific areas of the world). The finished product will then be delivered to the Government in digital (jpeg, tiff, bmp, pdf, doc, xls, ppt, mdb, mxd) and/or hard copy form (up to 36 wide paper maps).4.0	Tasks.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to questions from potential offerors.

1Q:  Do we have to build this sensor at NRL, or build it at our facility and deliver to NRL?

1A:  It does not need to be made at NRL.

2Q: The illuminator specifications lists 950nm - 1900nm laser illuminator, could clarification be provided.

2A:  The intent is to illuminate at a wavelength frequency between 950nm and 1900nm, not to illuminate all frequencies between 950nm and 1900nm.

3Q: How is the illuminator 950nm - 1900nm wavelength band to be interpreted: (a) the illuminator wavelength can be narrow band and must be in the band, (b) the illuminator output is broadband and must cover the band, or (c) the illuminator wavelength must be narrow band and must tune over the band? 

3A:  (a) is correct.

4Q: If the illuminator can be narrow band, can the illuminator output be at the same wavelength as the 1064nm laser designator? 

4A: Illuminator should be off the designator frequency.  Illuminator is the more important item, designator is a desired feature < not a requirement at this time.

5Q: Can the illuminator beam divergence be manually varied and set before a mission, or must it be commandable during a mission?  

5A:  Either is suitable, but commandable during a mission would be attractive.
6Q: Does the 2- 4 W maximum output power of the illuminator refer to average or peak power, when the illuminator is used in pulsed operation?  

6A:  Average power, 4W output is the maximum usable illuminator to avoid image degredation.

7Q: Is the application sensitive to the spatial uniformity/beam quality of the illuminator?  If so, can the spatially uniform the intensity of the illuminator be specified in some form? 

7A: Application is insensitive to spatial uniformity/beam quality.

8Q: No direct requirement for the IR marker or laser designator output power is specified.  For the purposes of estimating electrical power draw, can a goal for the output power of the IR marker and laser designator be specified? 

8A: Finder will be able to provide ~ 20W of prime power to share between the IR marker and laser designator.  The illuminator can consume up to an additional 20W.

<DESC>Amendment #4 to Solicitation VA-260-08-RP-01701) INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS TO BIDDERS/OFFERORS, section (a.5) is changed read as follows:Offerors shall submit their proposals and scanned copies of their Bid Guarantee Bonds electronically by 12:00 PM, 29 May, 2008 to Erik.Berg@va.gov. Original Bid Guarantee Bonds shall be sent to the address listed in Block 7.2)  Specifications Section 01010 General Requirements, 1.2.B.2 Deductive Bid Item #2 is deleated.3) Solicitation Questions:3.1 Question - The price of fuel is extremely volatile and can change as much as 30 to 40 % daily.ANSWER  -  Change the current deductive bid item #2.  Do not put anything in the bid concerning refilling the new above ground tanks.  The VA will transfer the current fuel to the new tanks, so no new fuel is necessary.3.2  Question - Please clarify your request for double walled piping.  From all suction lines, fill lines either to equipment or to the boiler room walls.  ANSWER - Double containment is required on piping outside of the building for the new above ground tanks.  3.3 Question - How often (number of lifts) will certified compaction testing be required (if at all)?ANSWER- Certified compaction testing will be required at least every five feet. 3.4 Question - Will the attached submittal be acceptable per pre-bid approval as noted in the subject section? (City of Medford approved aggregates, Field worksheet for aggregate,maximum density of construction materials),  ANSWER - The use of "  " minus is acceptable.3.5 Question - What is the rebar specification for the ballast in each UHOT pit?ANSWER - Drawings are not available for all four tanks, but as a reference, there is approximately 6 to 12 depth of concrete with a 6" x 6" mesh rebar type concrete slab under the tanks, and attached to the tanks with "J" hooks.3.6 Question  - Will an outside area be available for final storage?  Will this material be handled according to section 02200 Part 3.5 B ?  Will the VA consider using the clean material for backfill?  ANSWER - Yes.  Yes.  Yes.3.7 Question  - Questions regarding the engineered backfill of the eastern most tank pit.  The east side pit wall next to the transformers will be approximately 5.5 feet from the transformer to the north, the pit depth will be a minimum of 17 feet, because of the transformers location the east wall  cannot be sloped at 2 to 1 as needed therefore my question is would open graded rock such as non-compacted pea gravel be acceptable as fill for all or any portion of this pit in lieu shoring on the east wall?  Also can any or all of the trees on the northwest side of the pit be removed?  ANSWER - Due to the location of the transformer, some sort of shoring would be prudent.   Trees will not be removed unless absolutely necessary.3.8 Question  -  Per numbered sheet note 3 on drawing B-2.  Will the VA approve the use of clean excavated soils for backfill?  If not, will the VA approve unit pricing for any fill required exceeding the volume required for the removed UHOT's.ANSWER - Soils verified clean by HOT contractor can be used as backfill.3.9 Question - Will there be a requirement for submittals to be forwarded to OR-DEQ?  Or will submittals be forwarded to the  VA according to OR-DEQ criteria?  Excerpts of the specification suggest parts of the OR-DEQ-UST decommissioning regulations and those for leaking underground storage tanks instead of regulations regarding HOT's.  Will the VA accept decommissioning and sampling practices for HOT's as approved and regulated by OR-DEQ if they differ from the specification?ANSWER - The VA has HOT's not UST's, and the applicable regulations should be followed.  3.10 Question  - What is the age of the existing fuel oil and /or when were the last fuel drops?ANSWER - As much of the fuel that can be;  will be used in the boiler room before the tanks are removed.  3.11 Question  - Does the VA have access to a geotech report?  Does the VA have any geologic information regarding the entire site in order to determine if sloped sides would be possible for excavation on slab without construction of full pit shoring?  What is the actual distance from the edge of the electrical  trench to the edge of the ballast slab?  What is the voltage of all lines to and from transformers and conduits?ANSWER - The only geologic information available is in the February 2007 Subsurface Soil and Groundwater investigation report which will be available.  The actual distance is not known, and will have to be determined by the contractor.  There are high and low voltages from the transformers and conduits.3.12 Question  - Request for extension for the solicitation.ANSWER - Mr. Berg has answered this.3.13 Question - Can a copy of the report referenced in the specs, Subsurface soil and groundwater investigation conducted in 2007?ANSWER - The 2007 report will be provided as reference material only.  Site conditions may have changed since the report was finished.3.14 Question  - If groundwater investigation has been conducted, what is the ground water flow or recharge rates?  It is impossible to quantify the dewatering activity without this information.ANSWER - The only geologic information available is in the February 2007 Subsurface Soil and Groundwater investigation report which will be available as reference material only.  Site conditions may have changed since the report was finished.. 3.15 Question PPI - If soil samples have been taken to determine contaminants type and amount, has the limits of the contaminants been accurately identified both in area and in depth?  It is impossible to quantify the soil remediation activity with this information.ANSWER - The 2007 report is available, and to be used as reference only.  The contractor will have to verify the current site conditions during excavation.3.16 Question  - It is expected that the excavation, demolition, and removal of soils will harm the existing trees in the tank removal area.  Is it acceptable to remove the trees?ANSWER -   Only if absolutely necessary, will the trees be removed.3.17 Question  - The new tank pad design does not provide for spill containment.
